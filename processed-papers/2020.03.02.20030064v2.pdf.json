            "Data of the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths from January 21 to February 29, 2020, released daily by the National Health Commission of China and Hubei Provincial Health<br/><br/>Commission, were used.

            "The data of cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths with respect to each region were all well-fitted to the Boltzmann function (R2 for all the regression analyses being close to 0.999).<br/><br/>Consistently, the data for the cumulative numbers of 2003 SARS in mainland China, Hong Kong and worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. The potential total number of<br/><br/>COVID-19 deaths in mainland China, other provinces, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other cities in Hubei were estimated to be 3260 (95% CI 3187, 3394), 110 [109, 112], 3174 (3095, 3270), 2550 (2494, 2621) and 617 [607, 632], respectively. Similar results were obtained by<br/><br/>Richards function-based regression analysis.<br/><br/>Interpretation: The observation that the data of the cumulative numbers of deaths for both the on-going COVID-19 outbreak and the 2003 SARS epidemic in each geographic region were well fitted with the Boltzmann function strongly suggests that it is suitable for the simulation of deaths associated with coronaviruses-induced diseases. The estimation of COVID-19 deaths may help governments to evaluate the severity of the outbreak and also facilitate timely mental health care for the families of dead patients.<br/><br/>An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing in China and has spread worldwide 1-3. As of Feb 29, 2020, there have been 79824 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 2870 deaths in China, and the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan city and related regions in Hubei province of China have reported 66906 confirmed patients and 2761 deaths. Although the number of new confirmed cases has substantially decreased since Feb 13, 2020 and the outbreak appears to approach late phase in China, people have raised grave concerns about the severity of the outbreak, especially questioning how many patients will die eventually. Here we estimated the potential total number of COVID-19 deaths by applying Boltzmann function-based regression analysis, an approach we recently developed for estimating the potential total numbers of confirmed cases for both the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the gone 2003 SARS epidemic 4.<br/><br/>We collected data for analysis on the officially released cumulative numbers of deaths in mainland<br/><br/>China, other provinces than Hubei, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other cities in Hubei (from<br/><br/>Jan 21 to Feb 29, 2020). We first verified that the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases with respect to each region were all well fitted to the Boltzmann function (R2 all being close to 0.999); Fig. 1A), consistent with our earlier report using the data from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 4. Assuming that the number of deaths is proportional to the number of confirmed cases for the outbreak under specific circumstances, we speculated that the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths would also obey the Boltzmann function. In support of this speculation, the cumulative numbers of<br/><br/>COVID-19 deaths in the above regions were all well-fitted to the Boltzmann function (R2 all being close to 0.999; Figs. 1B, 1C and Table 1), with the potential total numbers of deaths being estimated as 3200\u00b140, 108\u00b11, 3100\u00b140, 2500\u00b140 and 604\u00b16 respectively (Table 1). This result, in conjunction with our earlier observation that the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases of<br/><br/>SARS in mainland China and worldwide were well fitted with the Boltzmann function, prompted us to analyze the cumulative numbers of 2003 SARS deaths in the same way.<br/><br/>Consistently, we observed that the cumulative numbers of 2003 SARS deaths in mainland China, Hong Kong and worldwide were all well fitted to the Boltzmann function (Fig. 1D), strongly suggesting that the Boltzmann function is suitable to simulate the course of deaths associated with coronavirus-caused diseases.<br/><br/>One issue regarding our analyses is that some COVDI-19 deaths might be miss-reported such that the reported death numbers represent a lower limit. For instance, 134 new deaths were suddenly counted from more than 13000 clinically diagnosed patients in Hubei Province on Feb 12, 2020<br/><br/>(as clearly indicated by a sudden jump of deaths in Fig. 1B). Another uncertainty might result from those unidentified COVID-19 deaths at the early phase of the outbreak. We applied the<br/><br/>Monte Carlo method (for detail, refer to the Methods section in SI file) to estimate such uncertainty assuming that the relative uncertainty of the reported numbers of deaths follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 2.5%. The potential total numbers of COVID-19 deaths in the above regions were estimated to be 3260 (95%<br/><br/>CI 3187, 3394), 110 [109, 112], 3174 (3095, 3270), 2550 (2494, 2621) and 617 [607, 632], respectively (Figs. 1E and S1), which are slightly higher than those estimated without uncertainty (refer to Table 1).<br/><br/>To verify our Boltzmann function-based estimations, we calculated the potential total numbers of deaths in the above regions by applying Richards function-based regression analyses, which had been explored to simulate the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases of 2003 SARS in different regions 5. The potential total numbers of COVID-19 deaths in mainland China, other provinces, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other cities were estimated to be 3342 (3214, 3527), 111 [109, 114], 3245 (3100, 3423), 2613 (2498, 2767) and 627 [603, 654], respectively (Figs. 1F and S2), which are close to what are estimated by our Boltzmann function-based analyses (Table 1).<br/><br/>Collectively, we observed that all sets of data from both the COVID-19 deaths and the 2003<br/><br/>SARS deaths were well fitted to the Boltzmann function. We propose that the Boltzmann function is suitable for analyzing not only the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, as reported by us recently 4 (also refer to Fig. 1A), but also those of deaths as reported here. We noticed that the COVID-19 deaths have been estimated by other groups using different models.<br/><br/>Li et al recently reported in this Journal 6 using the data from Jan 20 to Feb 11 that a total of deaths in Hubei would be 2250, a number much lower than the currently observed (2761 as of<br/><br/>Feb 29). Using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead model Anastassopoulou et al forecasted that the total death might exceed 7,000 by February 29 7, a number apparently much higher than the real one.<br/><br/>Since the case fatality and mortality rates in the epicenter of the outbreak are still much higher than that in other provinces of mainland China, there is a great potential for government to optimize preparedness and medical resource supplies therein, by which hundreds of lives of<br/><br/>COVID-19 patients, particularly those severe and critically ill patients 3, 8, might be saved. This potential is reflected the consecutive decrease of the case fatality rate in Hubei and Wuhan since<br/><br/>Chinese government provided a great amount of medical supplies therein 2, 3. In addition, our estimates on the course of COVID-19 deaths (refer to Table S2) may benefit the mental health service that needs to be timely provided to the families of dead patients 9, 10."

            "An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) caused by SARSCoV-2 is on-going in China and appears to approach late phase. It is highly demanding to estimate how many COVID-19 patients will die eventually. In this study, an estimate of the potential total number of COVID-19 deaths in mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces is provided. The results may help to eluate the severity of the epidemic and facilitate mental health care."

            "By using these established functions, the potential total number of deaths were forecasted. In addition, data of the cumulative number of 2003 SARS deaths in mainland China, Hong Kong and worldwide were collected from the WHO official website and analyzed in a similar manner.",
            "A Monte Carlo technique was applied to analyze the uncertainty of the estimates of the cumulative confirmed cases, and the results are presented using the resulting mean, median, and a 95%",

The estimation of COVID-19 deaths may help governments to evaluate the severity of the outbreak and also facilitate timely mental health care for the families of dead patients.",
            "An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing in China and has spread worldwide 1-3. As of Feb 29, 2020, there have been 79824 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 2870 deaths in China, and the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan city and related regions in Hubei province of China have reported 66906 confirmed patients and 2761 deaths. Although the number of new confirmed cases has substantially decreased since Feb 13, 2020 and the outbreak appears to approach late phase in China, people have raised grave concerns about the severity of the outbreak, especially questioning how many patients will die eventually. Here we estimated the potential total number of COVID-19 deaths by applying Boltzmann function-based regression analysis, an approach we recently developed for estimating the potential total numbers of confirmed cases for both the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the gone 2003 SARS epidemic 4.",

We first verified that the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases with respect to each region were all well fitted to the Boltzmann function (R2 all being close to 0.999); Fig. 1A), consistent with our earlier report using the data from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 4. Assuming that the number of deaths is proportional to the number of confirmed cases for the outbreak under specific circumstances, we speculated that the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths would also obey the Boltzmann function. In support of this speculation, the cumulative numbers of",

This result, in conjunction with our earlier observation that the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases of",

            "One issue regarding our analyses is that some COVDI-19 deaths might be miss-reported such that the reported death numbers represent a lower limit. For instance, 134 new deaths were suddenly counted from more than 13000 clinically diagnosed patients in Hubei Province on Feb 12, 2020",
