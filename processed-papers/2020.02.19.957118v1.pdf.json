        "abstract": "Using incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC), a murine genetic reference population, we previously identified a quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with low SARS-CoV titer. In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-/mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4-/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4\u2019s impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis. Importance Given the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this work suggest that Muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following SARS-CoV infection. With the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance Muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes. In addition, the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes.",

            "Most viral infections present with an array of symptoms following human infection, ranging from asymptomatic to self-limiting, chronic, and sometimes fatal disease. Some of this diversity is mediated by age, sex, and other comorbidities, but these demographics do not account for all of the variability in disease outcomes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)<br/><br/>and candidate gene studies have established a number of genes associated with human susceptibility to infectious diseases, but are limited by the large populations required to detect genetic effects and by existing knowledge gaps (Fellay et al, 2007; Ge et al, 2009; Lindesmith et al, 2003; L\u00f3pez et al, 2010). Furthermore, during outbreak settings there is often limited access to clinical samples from infected humans. Thus, host susceptibility allele identification is oftentimes heavily compromised by situational expediency and new approaches are needed to identify alleles that regulate emerging virus pathogenesis.<br/><br/>Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is a respiratory pathogen that first emerged in the Guangdong Province of China in November 2002, and rapidly spread to 28 countries, resulting in over 8,000 cases with a 10% case fatality ratio.<br/><br/>emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the discovery of several other related \u201cpre-epidemic\u201d bat coronaviruses that seem poised for sudden emergence emphasize the need for a comprehensive understanding of how highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, interact with their hosts to regulate disease severity (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cColeman_2013_a\" href=\"#rColeman_2013_a\">Coleman and Frieman, 2013</a>; Menachery et al, 2015b; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMenachery_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rMenachery_et+al_2016_a\">Menachery et al, 2016</a>). The importance of these early predictions was demonstrated by the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-<br/><br/>(Gorbalenya et al, 2020; Gralinski and Menachery, 2020), which has caused 45,171 confirmed cases and 1,115 deaths as of February 12, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020).    The subsequent<br/><br/>We have developed a model of CoV infection in the genetically diverse Collaborative<br/><br/>Cross (CC) population (Churchill et al, 2004; Collaborative Cross Consortium, 2012). This model allows us to assess the impact of host genetic variation on CoV disease, such as in the context of SARS-CoV pathogenesis (Gralinski et al, 2015). The CC panel contains mouse lines derived from a funnel breeding scheme of eight founder strains, including 5 traditional lab strains and 3 wild-derived strains (Churchill et al, 2004; Collaborative Cross Consortium, 2012; UNC Systems Genetics Core Facility, 2012). This population takes advantage of naturallyoccurring genetic polymorphisms to capture approximately 90% of the common genetic diversity within Mus musculus, and that diversity is distributed evenly throughout the genome, with elevated minor allele frequencies compared to standard natural populations (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAylor_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rAylor_et+al_2011_a\">Aylor et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2007_a\">Yang et al, 2007</a>; Yang et al, 2009; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2011_a\">Yang et al, 2011</a>). Our initial screen within an incompletely inbred set of CC mice (the preCC screen) (Gralinski et al, 2015), along with an F2 screen utilizing a highly resistant and highly susceptible CC mouse line (Gralinski et al, 2017), identified nine quantitative trait loci (QTLs) impacting SARS-CoV disease. Among these QTLs was locus HrS2 on chromosome 16, which was identified as modulating SARS-CoV titer levels in the lung (Gralinski et al, 2015).<br/><br/>Here, we narrow the HrS2 locus to a priority candidate gene, mucin 4 (Muc4), via the integration of sequence data from the CC founders (Keane et al, 2011) and RNA expression results from our preCC experiment. Low expression of Muc4 in mice containing the PWK/PhJ allele corresponded with the low SARS-CoV titer associated with the QTL located at locus HrS2.<br/><br/>We subsequently examined infection of mice lacking Muc4, predicting reduced viral load.<br/><br/>However, our findings suggest that while Muc4 does not regulate SARS-CoV titer, it does have broad activity attenuating the pathogenic impact of viral infections."

            "Selection of Muc4 as a SARS-CoV disease associated gene<br/><br/>In earlier studies, incipient CC lines were used to identify four QTLs associated with<br/><br/>SARS-CoV phenotypes in female mice, one of which was mapped on the basis viral titer in the lung at four DPI (Gralinski et al, 2015). A subsequent study utilizing both male and female F2<br/><br/>mice derived from a highly susceptible and highly resistant CC mouse line identified five more<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-associated QTLs, three of which were mapped at least partially on the basis of viral titer (Gralinski et al, 2017).<br/><br/>36,719,997, the pre-CC QTL accounted for 22% of the variation in viral titer, which ranged from over 108 PFU/lobe to below the limit of detection (102 PFU/lobe). The F2 QTLs, by comparison, were located on chromosomes 18, 7, and 12 and explained 12.9%, 12.3%, and 5.4%, respectively, of the observed variation in titers from high 10 2 to low 107 PFU/lobe. Thus, while<br/><br/>SARS-CoV titer in the lung is clearly influenced by multiple host genetic factors, the preCC QTL on chromosome 16 was chosen for candidate gene selection and validation. Analysis of allele effects revealed that the founder PWK/PhJ was the main driver of low SARS-CoV titer in the lung (Fig. 1A), and PWK/PhJ also had lower titers than any other founder strain at four DPI (Gralinski et al, 2015). We therefore used private SNPs or In/Dels found in PWK/PhJ to reduce the potential targets in the QTL to seven ncRNAs and 74 genes for downstream analysis.<br/><br/>Located on chromosome 16 from nucleotides 31,583,769-<br/><br/>To prioritize the list of ncRNAs and genes within the QTL, the relationship between RNA transcript levels and viral titer in the lung was examined. Sixty seven preCC mice had both microarray and titer data available, of which sixty had titers above the limit of detection (Gralinski et al, 2015).<br/><br/>microarray (Table S4) and Muc4 expression had the strongest correlation with viral titer, with five of the six Muc4 probes yielding positive correlations of 0.34-0.45 (Fig. 1B, Table S5). Using infection data from the founder mice, Muc4 RNA expression levels mimicked the allelic effects of the QTL with PWK/PhJ mice exhibiting low Muc4 RNA levels (Fig. 1C). Other potential targets included Lrrc33, Sec22a, Parp14, and Ildr1; however, these genes either have little known linkage to viral replication and the immune response (e.g., Lrrc33, Sec22a, and Ildr1) or the directionality of the correlation did not support their relationship to viral titer in the lung (Parp14). For Muc4, high levels of expression at mucosal surfaces and in various human<br/><br/>Of the 74 candidate genes, 54 had one or more probes on the cancers have been reported (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAndrianifahanana_et+al_2001_a\" href=\"#rAndrianifahanana_et+al_2001_a\">Andrianifahanana et al, 2001</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChaturvedi_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rChaturvedi_et+al_2008_a\">Chaturvedi et al, 2008</a>; Kamikawa et al, 2015). In addition, Muc4 plays a role in cell and anti-apoptotic signaling (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChaturvedi_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rChaturvedi_et+al_2008_a\">Chaturvedi et al., 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFunes_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rFunes_et+al_2006_a\">Funes et al, 2006</a>; Moniaux et al, 2007). Together, the data suggest that Muc4 may play a role in viral titers at day 4 post SARS-CoV infection.<br/><br/>Muc4 drives sex-based difference in weight loss<br/><br/>To examine the role of Muc4 during SARS-CoV infection, we utilized Muc4-/- mice (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRowson-Hodel_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rRowson-Hodel_et+al_2018_a\">Rowson-Hodel et al, 2018</a>) which have no gross differences in behavior, overall health, size, or lung function, the latter phenotype measured by plethysmography. Muc4-/- and WT control mice were infected with SARS-CoV and examined over a four-day time course. Following infection, a significant sex-based difference in weight loss between Muc4-/- and WT mice was observed (Table S3). Female Muc4-/- and control were essentially indistinguishable through two DPI (Fig.<br/><br/>2A). However, infected Muc4-/- females continued to lose weight through day four, with 42% (6 of 14) meeting euthanasia requirements (\u226520% weight loss) and another 42% (6 of 14) requiring increased observation (\u226510% weight loss). In contrast, the WT mice held static between days two and three and began to recover by day four, with no mice meeting the requirements for euthanasia and only 13% (2 of 15) requiring increased observation by a margin of \u22640.1g. This<br/><br/>Muc4-driven difference in weight loss was not observed in male mice following infection with<br/><br/>SARS-CoV (Fig. 2B).<br/><br/>Muc4 has minimal impact on viral load<br/><br/>Next, the impact of Muc4-/- on SARS-CoV viral load was measured. Lung lobes from male and female Muc4-/- and WT mice were harvested at two DPI, an acute timepoint previously associated with high SARS-CoV titer (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSheahan_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rSheahan_et+al_2008_a\">Sheahan et al, 2008</a>), and at four DPI, the timepoint at which the QTL on chromosome 16 was mapped (Gralinski et al, 2015). Surprisingly, despite trends for higher mean viral loads in Muc4-/- mice on day 2 and day 4, virus titers were not significantly different from WT mice at either timepoint (Fig. 3A). Similarly, despite differences in weight loss, viral titer in the lung also exhibited no sex effect (Table S3). Given the distribution of Muc4 in mucosal surfaces, viral load was further interrogated with IHC to determine whether<br/><br/>Muc4 might impact viral tropism in a way not readily determined by the measurement of infectious virus per lobe. Upon examining SARS-CoV antigen staining, however, no significant differences in antigen distribution were noted between Muc4-/- and WT mice in either airway or parenchymal staining (Fig. 3B and 3C). Together, the results indicated that the loss of Muc4 had minimal impact on SARS-CoV viral load or distribution.<br/><br/>Muc4-/- mice have reduced histopathological damage<br/><br/>Differences in lung damage were assessed using histopathological scoring of H&E stained lungs harvested at either two or four DPI. Similar to weight loss, the histopathology results demonstrated a clear and consistent sex-based phenotype. Female Muc4-/- mice had a pattern of lower pathology scores than WT mice (Fig. 4). Airway damage (denudation, debris, and inflammation) was minimally present in female Muc4-/- at day two or four post-infection (Fig.    4A-C).<br/><br/>female Muc4-/- mice as compared to female WT mice. In contrast, male Muc4-/- mice induced similar damage to male WT mice (Table S1).<br/><br/>Lung function altered in Muc4-/- female mice<br/><br/>Similarly, other histopathology and inflammation measures had very low scores in<br/><br/>To further evaluate damage to the lung following infection, whole body plethysmography was utilized to examine changes in pulmonary function (Fig. 5). Using only females, both WT and Muc4-/- mice were challenged with a lower dose (104 PFU) to ensure their survival over the full six day time course required to observe the onset, peak, and recovery of disordered lung function following SARS-CoV challenge in mice (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMenachery_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rMenachery_et+al_2015_a\">Menachery et al, 2015a</a>). Examining airway resistance (penH), the time to peak expiratory flow relative to total expiratory time (rPEF), and mid-tidal expiratory flow (EF50), all three measurements had statistically significant differences between SARS-CoV-infected and mock-infected mice within the Muc4-/- and WT groups (Supplementary Table S3). However, no Muc4-dependent differences in either penH (Fig. 5A)<br/><br/>or rPEF (Fig. 5B) were observed following SARS-CoV infection. In contrast, while not reaching statistical significance, EF50 trended higher in the Muc4-/- mice as compared to WT mice, peaking at day three post-infection (Fig. 5C). These results show a shift in the early breathing curve in Muc4-/- mice with more rapid exhalation and more labored breathing. These findings may have been exacerbated with the original, higher dose, but that experiment was precluded by the limited survival of Muc4-/- mice. Overall, the whole body plethysmography data indicate more difficult breathing for female Muc4-/- mice relative to their WT counterparts following<br/><br/>SARS-CoV infection.<br/><br/>Muc4-/- mice have augmented inflammation<br/><br/>Changes in the cytokine and chemokine responses following infection of Muc4-/- and WT mice were evaluated at two days post infection. While not significant when adjusted for multiple comparisons (Table S3), key inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL6 had increased expression in Muc4-/- mice as compared to WT mice (Fig. 6A-C). Similarly, MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and KC also had augmented expression in Muc4-/- mice (Fig. 6D-F). Notably, the increased values in Muc4-/- mice were maintained across both males and females. Together, the results indicate that Muc4-/- mice have augmented inflammatory cytokine responses relative to<br/><br/>WT mice, which may contribute to observed differences in pathogenesis.<br/><br/>Muc4 impacts pathogenesis for an unrelated virus<br/><br/>Because Muc4 modulated SARS-CoV susceptibility independent of viral replication, a cross-platform validation study was undertaken to begin assessing whether the Muc4 had widespread importance in viral pathogenesis.<br/><br/>Chinkungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus, causes inflammatory arthritis and swelling within the joints in human patients.<br/><br/>Muc4 has been detected in synovial sarcomas in humans, thus presenting a novel tissue environment and unrelated virus to test the impact of Muc4 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDoyle_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rDoyle_et+al_2011_a\">Doyle et al, 2011</a>). Male and female WT and Muc4-/- mice were infected with CHIKV and monitored for swelling of the footpad for seven days post infection (Fig. 7). The WT mice have minimal early stage swelling, as was expected with the C57BL/6N model. In contrast, Muc4-/- mice have augmented disease early during infection, displaying a biphasic swelling pattern. At days 2-4, both male and female mice have increased footpad swelling compared to control mice.<br/><br/>not observed during the second swelling event that took place between days six and seven post-infection. Notably, while sex based differences were observed at days two and four post infection, disease was more robust in male mice, contrasting observations seen with SARS-CoV infection. In either sex, however, the loss of Muc4 resulted in augmented disease during early time points and indicates a broad role for Muc4 in viral pathogenesis."

            "Importantly, This Muc4-specific difference was<br/><br/>Screening genetically diverse mouse models provides an opportunity to identify natural variation in novel factors which drive viral disease responses. These studies can also provide therapeutic, prophylactic and molecular insights into emerging pathogens, which are difficult to study during the context of an outbreak. Here, prior phenotypic QTL analysis, bioinformatics, and RNA expression analysis were leveraged to identify Muc4 as a high priority candidate gene driving differences in SARS-CoV titer. Utilizing a Muc4 knockout mouse, a role was confirmed for the gene in augmented SARS-CoV pathogenesis. While virus titers trended higher in Muc4-/-<br/><br/>mice at day 2 and 4, there was no statistically significant change as compared to WT control mice. However, in absolute terms the Muc4-/- mice did have a modest 62% higher titer on day two and a 51% higher titer on day four as compared to WT, and it is possible that this difference is biologically significant despite the lack of statistical significance as determined by p-value (Lytsy et al, 2018; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVyas_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rVyas_et+al_2015_a\">Vyas et al, 2015</a>). In addition, the loss of Muc4 was linked to enhanced<br/><br/>CHIKV disease in vivo. Together, this study highlights both the utility and the challenges in transitioning from QTL hits to single-molecule studies. Our initial hypothesis for Muc4 to play a role in controlling virus replication proved incorrect, or, at the very least, substantially more complex than a simple, direct correlate; however, our exploration found a disease-interaction that played a role in pathogenesis across multiple viruses.<br/><br/>Outside of human GWAS studies, where recombination rates are high, it has long proven a challenge to go from a QTL to individual candidate genes (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBrown_et+al_1997_a\" href=\"#rBrown_et+al_1997_a\">Brown et al, 1997</a>). Even with novel bioinformatic approaches, in the absence of large genomic deletions (Ferris et al., 2013), fortuitously gene-poor regions (Gralinski et al, 2015), or previously identified functions (Gralinski et al, 2017) candidate gene identification continues to be difficult. In this manuscript, we built a framework to integrate knowledge about the preCC genome sequences and a partner microarray dataset to narrow a QTL region down to a likely candidate based on expression correlations. Muc4 exhibited strong correlation data and low expression in the relevant founder strain. Additionally, Muc4 is known to play a role in anti-apoptotic signaling (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChaturvedi_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rChaturvedi_et+al_2008_a\">Chaturvedi et al., 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFunes_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rFunes_et+al_2006_a\">Funes et al, 2006</a>; Moniaux et al, 2007), analysis of published microarray data (Jonckheere N et al, 2012) reveals that cells lacking Muc4 express lower levels of interferonstimulated genes (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMenachery_2014_a\" href=\"#rMenachery_2014_a\">Menachery VD, 2014</a>), and the related mucin Muc1 is both anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory (Kato K et al, 2014; Li Y et al, 2010; Ueno K et al, 2008). We chose Muc4 as our priority candidate gene for follow up, with the initial hypothesis that Muc4 suppressed apoptosis and possible the interferon response, and that its absence in a Muc4-/- mouse would therefore lead to increased apoptosis and inflammation, thereby inhibiting SARS-CoV replication.<br/><br/>Our validation utilized a Muc4-/- mouse and confirmed a role for Muc4 in protection from<br/><br/>SARS-CoV- and CHIKV-induced disease and pathogenesis. However, we found essentially no differences in SARS-CoV viral load in the Muc4-/- mouse strain compared to WT mice. This may be due to sex (discussed more below), differences between naturally occurring SNPs impacting gene structure and expression and ablative knockouts, or the effects of overall genetic background on given gene variants (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLeist_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rLeist_et+al_2016_a\">Leist et al, 2016</a>). The SARS-CoV titer QTL on chromosome 16 was driven by the PWK/PhJ allele, which was strongly associated with lower viral titer and had low expression of Muc4. In contrast, mice with the C56BL/6J allele were associated with high titer and high expression of Muc4. Furthermore, PWK/PhJ mice encode functional variants in Muc4 that are not present in the other seven founder strains. It is therefore possible that C57BL/6 genetic background for the Muc4-/- mice, as opposed to a<br/><br/>PWK/PhJ background, obfuscated any role for Muc4 in the regulation of viral titer; this possibility is especially relevant given that the hypothesized role of Muc4 is in the context of complex signaling pathways requiring multiple molecular partners, rather than a direct role such as the physical barrier function of mucins. Alternatively, Muc4 may simply not impact viral titer following<br/><br/>SARS-CoV infection; this leaves the possibility that other genetic targets within the chromosome<br/><br/>QTL are responsible for limiting SARS-CoV titers at later time points. Furthermore, the existence of multiple titer-driven QTLs reaffirms that no single gene is expected to serve as the sole driver of SARS-CoV titer. Yet, despite the lack of QTL validation, these studies still identified a role for Muc4 in viral pathogenesis.<br/><br/>A surprising outcome from these studies was the demonstration of sex-specific and increased disease severity in Muc4-/- female mice infected with SARS-CoV. Females lacking<br/><br/>Muc4 consistently demonstrated increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-induced disease, while males did not. These results affirm the National Institute of Health emphasis on conducting animal studies in both male and female subjects (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cClayton_2014_a\" href=\"#rClayton_2014_a\">Clayton and Collins, 2014</a>; National Institutes of Health, 2015). Interestingly, SARS-CoV has been reported to cause more severe disease in male mice, with the female mice deriving their resistance at least in part from estrogen signaling (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChannappanavar_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rChannappanavar_et+al_2017_a\">Channappanavar et al, 2017</a>). Furthermore, epidemiological data from both SARS-CoV and<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 indicate that human females may be more resistant than human males (Chen et al, 2020; Huang et al, 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKarlberg_et+al_2004_a\" href=\"#rKarlberg_et+al_2004_a\">Karlberg et al, 2004</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLeong_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rLeong_et+al_2006_a\">Leong et al, 2006</a>). Estrogen increases<br/><br/>Muc4 transcription in a tissue-specific manner (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLange_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rLange_et+al_2003_a\">Lange et al, 2003</a>), offering a potential mechanism as to the greater impact of Muc4\u2019s absence in female mice. Sex effects in the context of Muc4 have also been reported in a murine model of colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDas_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rDas_et+al_2016_a\">Das et al, 2016</a>). These results hint that the role of Muc4 may differ in males and females based upon factors inherent to the host, such as localization, expression levels, or interactions with hormone signaling pathways, and may be less dependent on factors that are unique to a particular disease model.<br/><br/>Notably, a role for Muc4 extended across two different viral pathogens. SARS-CoV infection of female Muc4-/- mice, and CHIKV infection of both male and female Muc4-/- mice, resulted in more severe disease following infection. For SARS-CoV, loss of Muc4 exacerbated weight loss and increased lethality; surprisingly, less histopathologic damage was observed in the Muc4-/- lungs following infection despite augmented inflammatory cytokines. The results suggest that the loss of Muc4 may exacerbate systemic disease and delay the repair/recovery processing in the lung following SARS-CoV infection. A similar reduction in histopathology damage was observed with MERS-CoV infection of immunocompromised rhesus macaques providing evidence for this theory (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPrescott_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rPrescott_et+al_2018_a\">Prescott et al, 2018</a>). Notably, footpad swelling following<br/><br/>CHIKV infection is representative of systemic disease and is exacerbated in the absence of<br/><br/>Muc4. Although speculative, it is possible that Muc4 functions not to modulate local viral replication, but rather to limit disseminated disease. Clearly, more studies are needed to unravel these complex interactions.<br/><br/>Overall, this research demonstrates that Muc4 is a novel regulator of viral pathogenesis.<br/><br/>This study represents the first investigation of Muc4 in the context of any viral infection, and the absence of Muc4 exacerbates disease in two unrelated viruses. The SARS-CoV and CHIKV results indicate that Muc4 has a role in regulating susceptibility and may be widespread across viral pathogens. The study of mucin-driven cell signaling and its role in viral pathogenesis represents a novel avenue of research with the potential to identify new anti-viral therapeutic targets."

            "Most viral infections present with an array of symptoms following human infection, ranging from asymptomatic to self-limiting, chronic, and sometimes fatal disease. Some of this diversity is mediated by age, sex, and other comorbidities, but these demographics do not account for all of the variability in disease outcomes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)",

Furthermore, during outbreak settings there is often limited access to clinical samples from infected humans. Thus, host susceptibility allele identification is oftentimes heavily compromised by situational expediency and new approaches are needed to identify alleles that regulate emerging virus pathogenesis.",
