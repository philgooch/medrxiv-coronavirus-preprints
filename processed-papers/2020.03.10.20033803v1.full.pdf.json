        "abstract": "The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global crisis due to its quick and wide spread over the world. A good understanding of the dynamic of the disease would greatly enhance the control and prevention of COVID19. However, to the best of our knowledge, the unique features of the outbreak have limited the applications of all existing models. In this paper, a novel stochastic model is proposed which aims to account for the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China. We find that, (1) instead of aberration, there is a remarkable amount of asymptomatic individuals, (2) an individual with symptoms is approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic patient, (3) the transmission rate has reduced significantly since the implementation of control",

            "2.1 Data Sources<br/><br/>Data used in this study include the numbers of confirmed diagnosis, recoveries and fatalities in the following provinces and cities of China: Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Hunan. These publicly available data were retrieved from <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBeijing_2020_a\" href=\"#rBeijing_2020_a\">Beijing Municipal Health Commission (2020</a>); Shanghai Municipal Health Commission (2020); Chongqing Municipal Health Commission (2020); Health Commission of Guangdong Province (2020); Health Commission of Zhejiang Province (2020) and Health Commission of Hunan Province (2020) based on a daily update (see Table 5 and Table 6 in Appendix A). The corresponding population of residents in each region is collected from China National Bureau of Statistics (2018) (see Table 7 in Appendix A).<br/><br/>Note that we exclude Hubei province which is the epicenter of the current outbreak in this study due to the following reasons: (1) the medical resources in Hubei province were overburdened at the beginning of the epidemic, not all individual with confirmed diagnosis could get immediate hospitalization; in fact according to the Official Press Briefing by the Information Office of Hubei Provincial People\u2019s Government (2020) , as of February 8, 2020, there were 1499 patients remained with confirmed diagnosis and serve symptom who had yet been hospitalized; (2) the diagnostic criteria were changed overtime in Hubei which resulted in a massive surge of confirmed cases in mid February (National Heath Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China (2020a)); (3) the fatality rate in Hubei province was much higher than other regions in China. These features distinct the dynamic model in Hubei from the model in other regions of China, which will be considered in our future studies, see Section 6 for details.<br/><br/>2.2 Model Description<br/><br/>The evolution of an epidemic is usually described by either a deterministic dynamic model <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKermack_1927_a\" href=\"#rKermack_1927_a\">Kermack and McKendrick (1927</a>) or a stochastic one <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKendall_1956_a\" href=\"#rKendall_1956_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKendall_1956_a\" href=\"#rKendall_1956_a\">Kendall (1956</a></a>); <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBailey_1975_a\" href=\"#rBailey_1975_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBailey_1975_a\" href=\"#rBailey_1975_a\">Bailey (1975</a></a>), among which, the stochastic model is generally considered more realistic than the deterministic counterpart.

            "In this article, we propose a novel stochastic dynamic model in order to depict the transmission mechanism of COVID-19. In comparison with some existing models on COVID-19, our model features the employment of a stochastic dynamic as well as a comprehensive account for the infectious incubation period, the asymptomatic virus carriers, and the medical tracking measure with time latency, which make it probably closer to reality in these aspects. Moreover our proposed model also sets the basis for further studies with individual/network based models, which may not have an exact mean-field counterpart.<br/><br/>In the selected provinces and cities in our study, none of them has more than 2000 accumulated confirmed by now (See Table 5 in Appendix A). The numbers of confirmed cases, though alerting, are still not comparable to the total populations of these provinces, which are of the order 10 million-100 million (see Section 2 for exact population data). Moreover, for a system of size 1000 or so, it is not safe to argue the randomness is negligible due to the Law of Large Numbers, which makes it already sufficiently close to its hydrodynamic limit. This justifies the use of stochastic dynamic in our model."

Over the years, numerous modifications and generalizations have been made on the original SIR model to accommodate different epidemic characteristics, among which, the SIS model and SEIR model are most widely accepted ones. It is not surprising various deterministic dynamic models have been again designed and employed to the current outbreak of COVID-19. We hereby present a brief review on some of the representative works as follows.",
            "Recently Tang et al (2020) proposed a deterministic compartmental model by taking the clinical progression, epidemiological status, and the intervention measures into account. However, it implicitly assumed that the exposed population were not infectious, which is not the case in COVID-19. In addition, it was assumed that quarantine was implemented as soon as the infection occurred, which fails to reflect the inevitable latency brought by medical tracking. In the study of <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\">Wu et al (2020</a>), it proposed an extended SEIR model by considering transmissions among cities. However, it did not take the control measures such as quarantine and medical tracking into account. Furthermore, it was also assumed that exposed population are not infectious. For more similar or simpler deterministic ODE models to COVID-19, we refer to <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLiu_et+al_2020_b\" href=\"#rLiu_et+al_2020_b\">Liu et al (2020b</a>) for an overview.",
            "Besides the ODE models, an even older approach is to discretize the time and consider a difference equation (DE) model, which can be seen as a self-propelled sequence of numbers (or vectors). In such models, the increment or decrement of different compartment at each step is a function of the configuration in the previous step(s). Earliest examples of a DE include the well-known geometric and Fibonacci sequence, which can both be used to describe the growth of a biological population. Recently, a discrete time DE model was introduced in <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\">Yang et al (2020</a>) to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19. The proposed model correctly took the infectious incubation into account. However, this model did not consider the time lag between symptoms onset and diagnosis or the medical tracking. Besides, the rationale behind the assumption of the equal transmission probability between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is questionable.",
            "In contrast to the deterministic models (ODE or DE) summarized above, the transmission of a real world disease is inevitably random in nature. As a result, numerous stochastic dynamics models (see Section 3 for references) have been developed since the pioneering randomization of SIR model in <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKendall_1956_a\" href=\"#rKendall_1956_a\">Kendall (1956</a>). In fact, a deterministic ODE model can often be seen as the mean-field equation of the corresponding stochastic counterpart. Under certain conditions, the mean-field equation may represent the evolution of the expectation of the corresponding stochastic model. In some more generalized cases, the mean-field equation is a large scale approximation of the corresponding stochastic model, which can be seen as a process version of Law of Large Numbers. However, when the size of outbreak is not comparable to that of the total population, the approximation aforementioned may not be interpreted that the stochastic and deterministic models are close to each other by themselves, since they have both been rescaled to approximately a constant in these scenarios. See Section 3 for more details. Thus compared with deterministic models, the stochastic model may be a better choice to account for the non-negligible random nature of the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, the stochastic dynamic model is also known for its expandability to incorporate individual variations <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAthreya_1972_a\" href=\"#rAthreya_1972_a\">Athreya and Ney (1972</a>), or even spatial structures <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDurrett_1988_a\" href=\"#rDurrett_1988_a\">Durrett (1988</a>), which may not be fully captured by its mean-field equations. To our knowledge, the stochastic dynamic modeling for COVID-19 is yet relatively rare comparing to its deterministic counterparts, though preliminary approaches such as statistic exponential growth models was considered in recent studies of <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLiu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLiu_et+al_2020_a\">Liu et al (2020a</a>); <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhao_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhao_et+al_2020_a\">Zhao et al (2020</a>). Very recently in <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChinazzi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rChinazzi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChinazzi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rChinazzi_et+al_2020_a\">Chinazzi et al (2020</a></a>), an existing discrete time, stochastic model (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBalcan_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rBalcan_et+al_2009_a\">Balcan et al (2009</a>)) was employed to estimate the \u201ceffect of travel restrictions on the spread\u201d of COVID-19. However, unique features of SARS-CoV-2, such as the infectious incubation and asymptomatic carriers, as well as control measures such as medical tracking, are still yet to be captured in <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChinazzi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rChinazzi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChinazzi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rChinazzi_et+al_2020_a\">Chinazzi et al (2020</a></a>). To remedy the aforementioned issues in the existing studies, and to depict a more realistic transmission mechanism, we propose a novel stochastic compartmental model which captures the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China. Our proposed stochastic model aims to study the COVID-19 outbreak in the following aspects:",
            "\u2022 Estimation of key epidemiology parameters: Parameters in the model have specific epidemiology meanings. For example, \u03c1 stands for the proportion of symptomatic virus carriers, \u03b8E represents the proportion of infectivity of asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic carriers and q can reflect the strength of quarantine in each region. These parameters have very limited information in medical reports for direct access and can be estimated through our model.",
            "\u2022 Prediction of epidemic development: With a set of estimated parameters and initial values of the stages, we are able to simulate the development of epidemic over time t. This is helpful for capturing the spread tendency of the epidemic.",
            "\u2022 Estimation of un-observable carriers and epidemic containment date: Un-observable virus carriers in the crowd are nonnegligible for assess of epidemic control. Instead of epidemic control assessment only through existing infections, our model is able to take the trend of un-observable carriers into account. Based on the simulated trend of un-observable carriers, epidemic containment date can also be calculated.",
            "\u2022 Assessment of control measures The controlled reproduction number, Rc, which reflects the transmission ability of the epidemic, is essential for the assessment of control measures and speed of disease transmission. Rc can be estimated from the ratio between the in-and-out flows of the active virus carriers in a given time period in our model. Moreover, we can also conduct hypothetical \u201ccontrolled \u201d test and evaluate the effectiveness of medical tracking.",
            "Our main findings are as follows: 1. There exist a non-negligible portion of asymptomatic virus carriers.",

For example, E1(t) and E1(t) are close to each other in any sense without the rescaling factor. Actually the fact that the size of epidemic outbreak is not comparable to N itself already implies that lim \u03beN (t) = lim \u03beN (t) = (1, 0, 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0), N\u2192\u221e N (2.17)",

Based on preliminary trials, we find there is very limited information of \u03b3A which can be obtained from the data, and the estimate is highly influenced by the choices of prior. A possible explanation towards it is that \u03b3A is less related to the observations. Hence, instead of estimating \u03b3A with large uncertainty, we prefix \u03b3A = 1/10.

We can see that the observed accumulated confirmed cases and the population in IH lie in the calculated confidence interval well. Sensitivity analysis shows that the predicted confidence interval is stable against the uncertainty of \u03b3A, which gives us more confidence in that the proposed model can capture the spread tendency of the epidemic.",
            "The containment time of the outbreak is defined as the moment when the number of active virus carriers is first less than a threshold Tc. Noting that the spread of the disease is due to the existing active virus carriers in the proposed model, thus when the number of the active virus carriers decreases to a certain level, the new infections are limited, which means the epidemic is under control. Figure 5 shows the 95% confidence interval of the containment time of the outbreak for each region when Tc = 10. Among the six regions in this study, Shanghai is predicted to have the earliest containment time of February 21, while the containment time in Guangdong is predicted to be the latest, around March 7. From the daily report of NHC of China, new infections in Shanghai from February 17 to February 21 are 0,0,0,1,0; and new infections in Guangdong in the same period are 6,3,1,1,6, which potentially supports our prediction. Notice that in sensitivity analysis on \u03b3A, we find that when the recover rate of asymptomatic patients \u03b3A gets smaller, the expected containment time is longer. This is because smaller \u03b3A means that infected asymptomatic patients need more time to recover, which making the number of active virus carriers stays large for a longer time.",
            "The controlled reproduction number, Rc, reflects the transmission ability of the epidemic, which is one of the most important quantities in epidemiology. In this study, the evolution of Rc is approximated by the ratio between the in-and-out flows of the active virus carriers in a given time period, that is, for a time interval of length \u2206t, say [t, t + \u2206t], we keep tracking the transitions that leads to the increase/decrease of the active virus carrier population E and IN , with their accumulative numbers recorded. Precisely speaking, we define",
            "RC IN ([t, t + \u2206t]) = card t \u2208 [t, t + \u2206t], E(t) + IN (t) = E(t\u2212) + IN (t\u2212) + 1 and",
            "RC OU T ([t, t + \u2206t]) = card t \u2208 [t, t + \u2206t], E(t) + IN (t) = E(t\u2212) + IN (t\u2212) \u2212 1 .",
            "Recalling that our stochastic epidemic model evolves as a non-explosive continuous time Markov process, RC IN (\u00b7) and RC OU T (\u00b7) are both non-negative finite integers. And when RC OU T ([t, t + \u2206t]) = 0, we approximate the controlled reproduction number over [t, t + \u2206t] by its average value",
            "Simulation results for the approximated Rc in each region is shown in Figure 6. In most provinces and cities we find Rc is between 2 and 3 before control measures, and drops rapidly to about 0.2 during January 29 and February 1 in all selected regions.",
            "Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the current medical tracking policy with a hypothetical controlled test as follows: while keeping the other parameters we estimated unchanged, we set the traceable ratio q = 0 to represent the scenario where no medical tracking were implemented, and let the system evolve. Under this setting, the epidemic would still be contained, see Figure 7 for details, due to the contact control measures that reduce the values of \u03bb\u2019s and the reduction of diagnosis waiting time. However, for selected the provinces and cities in this study, there are significant delays in the dates of containment when q = 0, which indicates the current medical tracking policy contribute significantly in containing the epidemic."

        "Discussion": [
            "In this article, we propose a novel stochastic dynamic model in order to depict the transmission mechanism of COVID-19. In comparison with some existing models on COVID-19, Figure 4: Predicted confidence interval for key populations 19",
            "our model features the employment of a stochastic dynamic as well as a comprehensive account for the infectious incubation period, the asymptomatic virus carriers, and the medical tracking measure with time latency, which make it probably closer to reality in these aspects. Moreover our proposed model also sets the basis for further studies with individual/network based models, which may not have an exact mean-field counterpart.",
            "In the selected provinces and cities in our study, none of them has more than 2000 accumulated confirmed by now (See Table 5 in Appendix A). The numbers of confirmed cases, though alerting, are still not comparable to the total populations of these provinces, which are of the order 10 million-100 million (see Section 2 for exact population data). Moreover, for a system of size 1000 or so, it is not safe to argue the randomness is negligible due to the Law of Large Numbers, which makes it already sufficiently close to its hydrodynamic limit. This justifies the use of stochastic dynamic in our model.",
            "Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the government has conducted large-scale medical tracking and quarantine measures. These non-negligible measures have a significant impact on the spread of COVID-19. The sub-states of E, A and IN in our model are able to reflect such tracking and quarantine measures. Moreover, we also take the latency between medical tracking and quarantine into account. What\u2019s more, it has been found that the proportion of asymptomatic infected population is considerable. This justifies the introduction of state A. Finally, for an exposed and symptomatic individual, this model describes the complete process from infection to recovery(or death).",
            "In comparison, the model of <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rTang_et+al_2020_a\">Tang et al (2020</a>)(hereafter abbreviated as T.model) failed to consider the infectivity of the incubative virus carriers(E). What\u2019s more, T.model assumed quarantine measures will complete at the moment of contact. It is not completely physical since there should always be a time lag between the transition and the medical tracking.",
            "In Wu et al (2020), they didn\u2019t explicitly consider the impact of medical tracking and quarantine measures in dynamic. As we mentioned above, there are large-scale medical tracking and quarantine measures after the outbreak of COVID-19, and these measures have a significant impact on the spread of the virus. The questionable assumption that the exposed population is non-infectious has also been made in these two models.",
            "The recent work of <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\">Yang et al (2020</a></a></a>) proposed a discrete time difference equation(DE) which correctly accounted the infectious incubation period. However, they assumed a symptomatic patient is hospitalized (\u201cquarantine\u201d in their term, see Page 4 of <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\">Yang et al (2020</a></a></a>)) immediately at symptom onset, and did not consider the time lag between symptom onset diagnosis/hospitalization. Moreover, the probability of transmission b are questionably assumed to be the same for both the symptomatic and asymptomatic population. See Page 3-4 of <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\">Yang et al (2020</a></a></a>); and no medical tracking mechanism has been considered. Finally, there seems to be multiple imperfections in the interpretation of dynamic and estimation of parameters.",
            "The differences among models mentioned above are hereby summarized in Table 4: Our Model Tang et al (2020) <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\">Wu et al (2020</a>) <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\">Yang et al (2020</a>)",
            "From the estimated parameters, we find that about 30% of the infected are asymptomatic, patients with symptoms are about twice as likely to pass a pathogen to others as asymptomatic patients, and current containment measures are effective to reduce the contact and transmission rate. The containment time of the outbreak for different regions are predicted. Time-varying Rc is calculated and a rapid drop of Rc is observed due to containment measures that governments take. We have also conducted controlled test and find that in addition of the control measures reducing the contacts of people, the current medical tracking policy also contributes significantly in containing the epidemic.",
            "However, we acknowledge there are limitations in the propose model, 1. Given the limited data available, certainly parameters, especially those \u201cfar away\u201d from observation in the proposed model may have a potential risk of identification issues.",
            "2. The current estimation method converges slowly; 3. The proposed model does not apply if significant changes apply to the current epidemic control/treatment measure in the future; 4. The proposed model need further modification if a non-negligible portion of the asymptomatic patients remain infectious after the end of quarantine.",
            "5. Parameter estimates may lose precision if the stochastic model differs excessively from its simplification described in Section 4.",
            "In our future study, we propose to complement/generalize our current stochastic model from the following aspects:",
            "\u2022 Improved medical tracking dynamic: In this ongoing work, we are to introduce a more realistic dynamic for medical tracking. Our current model has already considered the latency between transmission and quarantine. While in this modification, medical tracking is triggered in a more physical manner by the affirmative diagnosis of the transmission source. In this new model the quarantine process of each exposed agent depends on his/her individual contact history. Thus an individual based, rather than compartment dynamic is needed. Then the parameters we have estimated can be used as a basis for the individual-based model.",
            "\u2022 Introduction of medical service capacity: In this modification, the maximal capacity of the medical service system is to be considered, which might be overloaded when facing a massive outbreak. This idea was first inspired by an Amateur Demonstration made by Ele laboratory (2020) on a site named \u201cbilibili\u201d, and seems to be among the key features of the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. We may also allow such capacity to be time/configuration dependent to model the contribution of building the \u201cemergency hospitals\u201d in Wuhan.",
            "\u2022 Population flows over cities: We will model the migration of people over different regions, which could have played an essential role in the spread of the epidemic before the Chinese New Year of 2020. We will also consider the transmissions on board and even allow the population flow to react on the information they have about the epidemic situation."
