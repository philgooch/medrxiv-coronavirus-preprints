        "abstract": "2 SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of 3 viral pneumonia around the world. While genetically distinct from the original SARS-CoV, both 4 group 2B coronaviruses share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses 5 harbored in bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to 6 inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate SARS-CoV-2 relative to 7 the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral 8 replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel coronavirus is much more sensitive to 9 type I interferon pretreatment. We subsequently examined homology between SARS-CoV and 10 SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading frame (ORF) 3b and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to the IFN response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that could help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development. 15",

            "At the end of 2019, a cluster of patients in Hubei Province, China was diagnosed with a viral pneumonia of unknown origins. With community links to the Hunnan seafood market in<br/><br/>Wuhan, the disease cluster had echoes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak that emerged at the beginning of the century 1. The 2019 etiologic agent was identified as a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2 2.<br/><br/>The new virus has nearly 80% nucleotide identity to the original SARS-CoV and the corresponding CoV disease, COVID-19, has many of the hallmarks of SARS-CoV disease including fever, breathing difficulty, bilateral lung infiltration, and death in the most extreme cases years old), health status, and health care workers, similar to both SARS and MERS-CoV 5.<br/><br/>Together, the results indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease have strong similarity to the original SARS-CoV epidemic occurring nearly two decades earlier.<br/><br/>. In addition, the most severe SARS-CoV-2 disease corresponded to old age (>50<br/><br/>In the wake of the outbreak, major research efforts have sought to rapidly characterize the novel CoV to aid in treatment and control. Initial modeling studies predicted subsequent cell culture studies confirmed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 utilizes human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry, the same receptor as SARS-CoV<br/><br/>Extensive case studies indicated a similar range of disease onset and severe symptoms seen with SARS-CoV 5. Notably, less severe SARS-CoV-2 cases have also been observed and were not captured in the original SARS-CoV outbreak. Importantly, screening and treatment guidance has relied on previous CoV data generated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Treatments with both protease inhibitors and type I interferon have been employed 4; similarly, remdesivir, a drug targeting viral polymerases, has been reported to have efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 similar to findings with both SARS- and MERS-CoV initiated with a focus on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the major antigenic determinate    9-12 and<br/><br/>. Importantly, several vaccine efforts have been<br/><br/>Together, the similarities with SARS-CoV have been useful in responding to the newest CoV outbreak.<br/><br/>In this study, we further characterize SARS-CoV-2 and compare it to the original SARS-<br/><br/>CoV. Using Vero E6 cells, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics as SARS-CoV following a low dose infection. In contrast, we find that SARS-CoV-2 is much more sensitive to type I interferon (IFN) pretreatment as compared to SARS-CoV. These results suggest distinct changes between the CoVs in terms of IFN antagonism and we subsequently examined sequence homology between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that may be responsible for these differences. Together, the results suggest SARS-<br/><br/>CoV-2 lacks the same capacity to control the type I IFN response as SARS-CoV."

            "Our initial studies infected Vero E6 cells using a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to explore the viral replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV. Following infection, we find that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar kinetics, peaking 48 hours post infection (Fig. 1A). While SARS-CoV-2 titer had slightly lower viral titers at 24 hours post infection, the results were different statistically different between the novel CoV and the original epidemic strain.<br/><br/>cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections.<br/><br/>Together, the results indicated that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar replication kinetics in Vero E6 cells.<br/><br/>By 48 hours, replication in both viruses had plateaued and significant<br/><br/>We next evaluated the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to type I interferon (IFN)    pretreatment.<br/><br/>pathogens including hepatitis B and C viruses as well as HIV<br/><br/>MERS-CoV outbreaks, type I IFN has been employed with limited effect pretreated Vero E6 cells with 1000 units of recombinant type I IFN 18 hours prior to infection.<br/><br/>Type I IFN treatment has been a standard approach for a wide variety of<br/><br/>.

In this study, we<br/><br/>Vero E6 lack the capacity to produce type I IFN, but are able to respond to exogenous forms<br/><br/>Following pretreatment with type I IFN, SARS-CoV infection has a modest reduction in viral titer (1.5 log plaque forming units (PFU)) as compared to untreated control 24 hours post infection (Fig. 1B). However, by 48 hours, SARS-CoV has nearly equivalent viral yields as the untreated conditions (7.2 log PFU versus 7.5 log PFU). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 shows a significant reduction in viral replication following type I IFN treatment. At both 24 and 48 hours post infection, SARS-CoV-2 had massive 3-log (24 HPI) and 4-log (48 HPI) drops in viral titer as compared to control untreated cells.<br/><br/>sensitivity in SARS-CoV-2 not observed with SARS-CoV.<br/><br/>Conservation of IFN antagonists across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>Considering the sensitivity to type I IFN, we next sought to evaluate changes between SARS-<br/><br/>CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Previous work has established several key IFN antagonist in the SARS-CoV genome including NSP1, NSP3, ORF3b, ORF6, and others compared the sequence homology across viral proteins from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and several bat SARS-like viruses including WIV16-CoV<br/><br/>Using sequence analysis, we found several changes to SARS-CoV-2 that potentially contribute to its type I IFN sensitivity (Fig. 2). For SARS-CoV structural proteins including the nucleocapsid (N) and matrix (M) protein, a high degree of sequence homology (>90%AA identity) suggests that their reported IFN antagonism is likely maintained in SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like viruses. Similarly, the ORF1ab poly-protein retains high sequence identity in SARS-CoV-2 and several known antagonists contained within the poly-protein (NSP1, NSP7, NSP14-16) are highly conserved relative to SARS-CoV. One notable exception is the large papain-like proteases, NSP3, which only 76% conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 does maintain a deubiquitinating domain thought to confer IFN resistance<br/><br/>SARS-CoV ORF3b, a 154 amino acid (AA) protein known to antagonize the type I IFN<br/><br/>Together, the results demonstrate clear type I IFN    , SHC014-CoV    . Therefore, we    , and HKU3.1-CoV<br/><br/>. For responses by blocking IRF3 phosphorylation<br/><br/>ORF3b contains a premature stop codon resulting in a truncated 20 AA protein. Similarly, HKU3.1-CoV also has a premature termination resulting in a predicted 39 AA protein.

            "With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, viral characterization remains a key factor in responding to the emergent novel virus. In this report, we describe differences in the type I IFN sensitivity between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV. While both viruses maintain similar replication in untreated Vero E6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 has a significant decrease in viral replication following type I IFN pretreatment. This sensitivity to type I IFN is distinct from the original SARS-CoV and suggests that the novel CoV has distinct host interactions driving disease outcomes. Analysis of viral proteins finds SARS-CoV-2 has several changes that potentially impact its capacity to modulate the type I IFN response, including loss of ORF3b and a short truncation of ORF6, both known as type I IFN antagonists for SARS-CoV our results suggest SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have differences in their ability to control the<br/><br/>, sequence analysis indicates that SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>.

            "Terminal of SARS-CoV ORF6 resulted in ablated antagonism homology analysis suggests that differences in NSP3, ORF3b, and/or ORF6 may be key drivers of SARS-CoV-2 type I IFN susceptibility"

        "Conclusion": [
            "With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, viral characterization remains a key factor in responding to the emergent novel virus.",
            "This augmented type I IFN sensitivity is likely due to changes in viral proteins between the two epidemic CoV strains",
            "Moving forward, these data could provide important insights for both the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 as well as developing novel animal models of disease.",
            "In this ongoing outbreak, the results highlight a distinction between the highly related viruses and suggest insights from SARS-CoV must be verified for"
