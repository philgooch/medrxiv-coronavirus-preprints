        "abstract": "Steroid compounds, which are expected to have dual functions in blocking host inflammation and MERS-CoV replication, were screened from a chemical library. Within this library, ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed human coronavirus replication in cultured cells, but did not suppress replication of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus. The effective concentration of ciclesonide to block SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19)\n\u03bc replication (EC90) was 6.3 M. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. A recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonide suppression of viral replication. These observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonide was specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patients suffering MERS or COVID-19.",

            "<strong>Results and Discussion</strong><br/><br/>Steroid compounds, which are expected to have dual functions in blocking both coronavirus replication and host inflammation, were screened from a chemical library. The cytopathic effect caused by MERS-CoV infection was measured to evaluate viral replication. Four steroid compounds, ciclesonide, mometasone furoate, mifepristone, and algestone acetophenide conferred a greater than 95% cell survival rate (Fig. S1).<br/><br/>Next, concentration-dependent viral growth suppression and drug cytotoxicity were assessed. Ciclesonide exhibited low cytotoxicity and potent suppression of viral growth (Fig. 1a). Cortisone and prednisolone, which are commonly used for systemic steroid treatment, dexamethasone, which has strong immunosuppressant effects, and fluticasone, a commonly used inhaled steroid, did not suppress viral growth (Fig. 1a).<br/><br/>The antiviral effects of steroids against various species of viruses were tested by quantifying propagated virus in culture medium. Ciclesonide and mometasone also suppressed replication of other coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV, but not replication of RS virus or influenza virus (Fig. S2). In addition, ciclesonide slightly but significantly inhibited rubella virus (having positive strand RNA genome) replication (Fig. S2), suggesting that ciclesonide interacted with the replication site of positive-strand RNA virus intracellularly.<br/><br/>To identify the drug target of virus replication, we conducted 11 consecutive MERS-CoV passages in the presence of 40 \u03bcM ciclesonide or 40 \u03bcM mometasone. A mutant virus that developed resistance ciclesonide was generated (Fig. 1b), but no resistant virus to mometasone was generated. Next-generation sequencing identified that an amino acid substitution at A25V (C19647T in the reference sequence NC_019843.3) in nonstructural protein 15 (NSP15), coronavirus endoribonuclease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], was the predicted mechanism for viral resistance to ciclesonide. A recombinant virus carrying the A25V amino acid substitution (Re-Nsp15-A25V) was generated from the parental MERS-CoV/EMC strain (Re-EMC/MERS) with a BAC reverse genetics system [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], which overcame the antiviral effect of ciclesonide (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, the mutant virus was inhibited by mometasone, suggesting that the antiviral target of mometasone was different from that of ciclesonide.<br/><br/>Next, the effect of ciclesonide on SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] were infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of steroids or other inhibitors. At 6 h post-infection, cellular RNA was isolated, and real-time PCR was conducted to quantify the amount of viral RNA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Ciclesonide and mometasone suppressed viral replication with a similar efficacy to lopinavir (Fig. 2a). For comparison, viral cell entry inhibitors were tested. E64d substantially reduced viral RNA levels, but nafamostat and camostat had only modest antiviral effects, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 primarily utilized the cathepsin/endosomal pathway of cell entry rather than the TMPRSS2/cell surface pathway to enter TMPRSS2-expressing cells, consistent with a recent study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].<br/><br/>\u03bc Ciclesonide blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication at low concentrations (EC50 = 4.4 M; \u03bc \u03bc EC90 = 6.3 M; CC50 > 100 M) (Fig. 2b).<br/><br/>This study suggests that ciclesonide presumably interacts with viral NSP15, either directly or indirectly, to suppress viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. An amino acid substitution in the ciclesonide-resistant mutant, located at the dimerization site of the NSP15 homo-hexamer [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], suggested that ciclesonide interacts with NSP15 during viral biogenesis. Future studies will provide a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms of ciclesonide suppression of viral replication.<br/><br/>Ciclesonide is a safe drug, and can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Inhaled ciclesonide is expected to reduce viral replication and host inflammation in the lungs, with decreased immunosuppressive effects compared to systemic corticosteroids, as ciclesonide primarily remains in the lung tissue, and does not significantly enter the bloodstream. Treatment of patients with ciclesonide should be carefully evaluated, considering the benefit-risk balance of the drug."

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were propagated in Vero and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.<br/><br/>Steroids and inhibitors. The following compounds were used: cortisone, prednisolone, fluticasone, dexamethasone, algestone acetophenide, mifepristone, mometasone furoate, and ciclesonide (from Prestwick the Chemical Library ;PerkinElmer, MA, USA), nafamostat (N0289; Sigma), camostat (3193; Tocris Bioscience, USA), E64d (330005; Calbiochem, USA), and lopinavir (SML1222; Sigma).<br/><br/>Quantification of coronaviral RNA.

A recombinant virus carrying the A25V amino acid substitution (Re-Nsp15-A25V) was generated from the parental MERS-CoV/EMC strain (Re-EMC/MERS) with a BAC reverse genetics system [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], which overcame the antiviral effect of ciclesonide (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, the mutant virus was inhibited by mometasone, suggesting that the antiviral target of mometasone was different from that of ciclesonide.",
            "Next, the effect of ciclesonide on SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] were infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of steroids or other inhibitors. At 6 h post-infection, cellular RNA was isolated, and real-time PCR was conducted to quantify the amount of viral RNA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Ciclesonide and mometasone suppressed viral replication with a similar efficacy to lopinavir (Fig. 2a). For comparison, viral cell entry inhibitors were tested. E64d substantially reduced viral RNA levels, but nafamostat and camostat had only modest antiviral effects, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 primarily utilized the cathepsin/endosomal pathway of cell entry rather than the TMPRSS2/cell surface pathway to enter TMPRSS2-expressing cells, consistent with a recent study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].",
            "\u03bc Ciclesonide blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication at low concentrations (EC50 = 4.4 M; \u03bc \u03bc EC90 = 6.3 M; CC50 > 100 M) (Fig. 2b).",
            "This study suggests that ciclesonide presumably interacts with viral NSP15, either directly or indirectly, to suppress viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. An amino acid substitution in the ciclesonide-resistant mutant, located at the dimerization site of the NSP15 homo-hexamer [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], suggested that ciclesonide interacts with NSP15 during viral biogenesis. Future studies will provide a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms of ciclesonide suppression of viral replication.",
            "Ciclesonide is a safe drug, and can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Inhaled ciclesonide is expected to reduce viral replication and host inflammation in the lungs, with decreased immunosuppressive effects compared to systemic corticosteroids, as ciclesonide primarily remains in the lung tissue, and does not significantly enter the bloodstream. Treatment of patients with ciclesonide should be carefully evaluated, considering the benefit-risk balance of the drug."
