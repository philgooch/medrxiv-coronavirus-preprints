        "abstract": "Background: COVID-19 outbreak is spreading globally. Although the risk of infection in the US is currently low, it is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak.\nMethods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. Majority of the respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak.",

            "We found that the public trusted the CDC director to lead the COVID-19 response with trust in the public health/scientific leadership being high. Responsive, open, and respectful communication with the US population by these agencies may improve public health compliance and safety.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Furthermore, although participants reported relatively low risk perception, many supported restrictive policies for infection prevention. A portion of the sample also supported temporary discrimination based on someone\u2019s country of origin. These responses are concerning, and preemptive targeted messaging by the public health agencies is required to ensure a compassionate response to this outbreak. Our findings may be influenced by possible selection bias because participants needed a CloudResearch account and access to smartphone/computer to participate. However, our sample was fairly representative of the general adult US population. A weighted analysis based on age and gender demonstrate that our results are generalizable to national population (Table 2). Data for weighted analysis were extracted from US Census data.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>  ]  Sample Result    Weighted Result<br/><br/>Risk Perception Score (mean)<br/><br/>Confidence in Sources of information (mean)<br/><br/>Healthcare Professionals    CDC/NIH    TV    Print    Web    Friends/Family    Social Media<br/><br/>Who should lead the US response to COVID-19 (%)    Director of CDC    Director of NIH<br/><br/>Secretary of DHHS<br/><br/>State Departments of Health<br/><br/>Local Health Departments<br/><br/>Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust.

        "Abstract": [],
        "Background": [
            "The current novel coronavirus outbreak, COVID-19, has spread to 28 countries and territories with tens of thousands infected and thousands of deaths (1). Although risk of contracting the disease in the United States (US) is currently low (2), it is important to understand risk perceptions about COVID-19 and trust in political and public health/scientific leadership among the US population to better inform messaging and policies (3).",
            "Objective: In the first study of its kind on COVID-19, our objective was to survey the adult US population to better understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak."
        ],
        "Methods and Findings": [
            "We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. Majority of the respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust."
        ],
        "Methods": [
            "Data were collected using an electronic questionnaire via Qualtrics\u00ae (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). Participants completed the questionnaire through the CloudResearch (4) online platform in early February 2020. We asked participants to rank who they felt should lead the US response to COVID-19. Options included the president, Congress, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Director for the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Supplementary Material). In addition, participants completed the perceived risk scale (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.71) which had 10 survey-items (5-point Likert Scale: 0 = strongly disagree/disagree/neutral; 1 = agree/strongly agree). We also asked about their support for restrictive infection prevention policies and the reliability of various sources of information (Supplementary Material). Yale University Institutional Review Board approved this study. Participants provided informed consent prior to data collection."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "The sample consisted of 718 adults and was similar to the US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity, and education (Table 1).",
            "Over 90% of our sample was aware of the COVID-19 mostly through the news (n = 522, 73%). The majority of participants wanted the CDC Director (n = 382, 53%) or the NIH Director (n = 117, 16%) to lead the COVID-19 response (Figure 1). However, only 13% of participants wanted the president (n = 91) or Congress (n = 5, 1%) to lead the response (Figure 1).",
            "Dept.",
            "The mean risk perception score was 5.0 out of 10 (SD = 1.9; Figure 2). Strict policies for infection prevention including quarantine (n = 571, 83%) and travel restriction (n = 519, 75%) were endorsed by most participants. Additionally, thirty-five percent of participants supported \u201ctemporary discrimination based on someone\u2019s country of origin\u201d in case of an outbreak (n = 244, 35%).",
            "The most trusted sources of information for the participants were healthcare professionals (M = 4.3; SD = 0.9) and health officials (e.g. CDC and NIH; M = 4.2; SD = 1.0). The least trusted source of information was social media (M = 2.8; SD = 1.2; Figure 3).",
            "Healthcare CDC/NIH TV Prof.",
            "Over 90% of the participants correctly identified CDC-recommended (5) infection prevention measures (Figure 4).",
            "Discussion. We found that the public trusted the CDC director to lead the COVID-19 response with trust in the public health/scientific leadership being high. Responsive, open, and respectful communication with the US population by these agencies may improve public health compliance and safety.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Furthermore, although participants reported relatively low risk perception, many supported restrictive policies for infection prevention. A portion of the sample also supported temporary discrimination based on someone\u2019s country of origin. These responses are concerning, and preemptive targeted messaging by the public health agencies is required to ensure a compassionate response to this outbreak. Our findings may be influenced by possible selection bias because participants needed a CloudResearch account and access to smartphone/computer to participate. However, our sample was fairly representative of the general adult US population. A weighted analysis based on age and gender demonstrate that our results are generalizable to national population (Table 2). Data for weighted analysis were extracted from US Census data.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]",
            "Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust. Strategic messaging by the CDC and the NIH through television, print, and internet has strong potential to alleviate unnecessary fear among the US population."
