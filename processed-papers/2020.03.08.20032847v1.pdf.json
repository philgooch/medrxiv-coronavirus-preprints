        "abstract": "This work applies a data-driven coding method for prediction of the COVID-19 spreading profile in any given population that shows an initial phase of epidemic progression. Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before the end of March 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city will be less than 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.02%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively.",

            "The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious disease, which began to spread in China in mid December 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], and as the volume of intercity travel escalated around the Lunar New Year period, the number of infected individuals began to soar in mid January 2020. With no travel restriction in place due to the low level of vigilance or unawareness of the disease during the early phase of the outbreak, the spreading of the disease had gone almost unobstructed. Travel restriction began to be implemented throughout China since January 24, 2020, which has proven to be effective in curbing the spread of the virus. However, international traffic has not ceased and infectious<br/><br/>Preprint submitted to medRixv.org individuals (who may or may not show any symptom at the time of travel) have actually travelled to different countries with the virus they contracted. Recent studies also show that travel restriction did contribute to the control of the spreading of COVID-19 within China as well as in a global context [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. By February 20, 2020, China had confirmed a total of 74,579 cases of COVID-19 infection, with death toll reaching 2,119. While China has begun to see declining numbers of infected cases in most cities from late February, other countries started to report surging number of cases in some cities or regions. As of March 6, 2020, the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 infection was 100,162 worldwide, with South Korea, Italy and Iran reporting surges of infected cases within two weeks. Moreover, the global mortality rate has remained around 3%.<br/><br/>In our recent work (available on February 19, 2020) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], intercity travel data obtained from Baidu Migration [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] has been collected and integrated into the traditional SusceptibleExposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] to account for the effects of inflow and outflow traffic between 367 cities in China. Parameters of susceptible-to-exposed infection rates, exposed-to-infected infection rates, and recovery rates for 367 cities have been identified by fitting the augmented SEIR model with historical data available from the National Health Commission of China. The predicted spreading profiles of the 367 Chinese cities (which were available on February 19, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]) have been highly consistent with the actual profiles, including the times of infection peaks and the percentages of infected individuals in the 367 cities.<br/><br/>In this work, we build on the data and estimated parameters obtained for 367 cities in our prior work [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and establish a library of profiles (sets of codes) of different spreading profiles. Suppose a new outbreak has occurred in a given population. The numbers of infected and recovered cases during the early phase of the spreading form an initial profile. This initial or incomplete profile is compared with the historical full profiles obtained previously. Then, by selecting the best fit historical profiles, we identify the candidates parameters for prediction of the future spreading profile in that given population (of a city or region). It should be emphasized that the set of historical profiles obtained previously covers various possible spreading dynamics, representing a variety of contact topologies and transmission mechanisms including the travel effects that have been integrated in the model used to capture the transmission dynamics of the 367 cities. Thus, a new outbreak in a given population would likely follow one or a combination of the profiles based on the augmented model in our previous work [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and hence can be reconstructed from the historical sets of profiles. In this work, we develop a procedure for implementing the selection of historical profiles, identification of best-fit parameters and construction of future profile. We apply the procedure to predict the epidemic progression in the cities of South Korea, Italy and Iran. Results of this study show that the spreading of COVID-19 in most cities in South Korea will peak between March 8 and March 16, 2020, and Italy will peak between March 12 and March 26, 2020, while Iran would have its peak around March 22, 2020. We also investigate the number of infected individuals in each city or region. Our method provides the average number of individuals eventually infected, along with a predicted deviation range at 95% confidence level. For Korea, we predict that Daegu and Gyeongsang North Road would have around 7,619 and 1,287 people eventually infected (i.e., 0.306% and 0.062% of the city\u2019s population), respectively, whereas the number of infected individuals in other cities in South Korea would be fewer than 300, i.e., less than 0.01% of city population. For Italy, we predict that Lombardi and Amelia Romagna would eventually have about 4,784 and 1,555 infected cases (i.e., 0.399% and 0.162 % of region\u2019s population), respectively, and the number of people eventually infected in other cities in Italy would be below 700 (<0.05% of city population). Moreover, Iran would have around 14,450 infected individuals, i.e., 0.018% of its population, of which around 2,498 and 1,698 will be expected in Tehran and Zanjan (i.e., 0.39% and 0.2% of the city\u2019s population). In addition, the number of people infected in most other cities would be fewer than 1,000 (<0.1% of the city\u2019s population). From the progression trends of the epidemic these three countries, provided control measures continue to be in place, the epidemic would come under control before the end of April 2020.<br/><br/>In the remainder of the paper, we first introduce the official daily infection data used in this study. The augmented SEIR model is briefly reviewed, mainly to introduce the parameters of the model used for prediction of spreading profiles. The key procedure for matching historical profiles and prediction of future spreading profiles will be explained. Results of application of the proposed method to prediction of the peaks and extents of outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran will be given. Finally, we will provide a discussion of our estimation of the propagation and the reasonableness of our estimation in view of the measures taken by the authorities in controlling the spreading of this new disease.    2. Data<br/><br/>The World Health Organization currently sets the alert level of COVID-19 to the highest, and has made data related to the epidemic available to the public in a series of situation reports as well as other formats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Our data include the number of infected cases, the cumulative number of infected cases, the number of recovered cases, and death tolls, for individual cities and regions in South Korea, Italy and Mazandran, from February 19, 2020, to March 6, 2020. Data organized in convenient formats are also available elsewhere [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Samples of data for Daegu, Gyeongsang North Road (South Korea), Lombardi, Amelia Romagna, Tehran and Iran are shown graphically in Figure 1. It should be noted that the data obtained for South Korea, Italy and Iran correspond to initial stages of the epidemic progression as the number of infected cases are still climbing, as of March 6, 2020."

            "3.1. The Augmented SEIR Model<br/><br/>The travel-data augmented SEIR model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] describes the spreading dynamics in terms of a basic fourth-order dynamical system with consideration of intercity travel in China. Consider a city j of population Pj. The states of the model are the number of susceptible individuals Ij(t), the number of exposed individuals (infectious but without symptom) Ej(t), the number of infected individuals Ij(t), and the number of recovered or removed individuals Rj(t). The model takes the following form in discrete time [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]: Xj(t + 1) = FaSEIR(Xj(t), Mj, \u03bcj)    (1)<br/><br/>where Xj(t) = [Sj(t) Ej(t) Ij(t) Rj(t)]T is the state vector on day t, FaSEIR(.) is the traveldata augmented function, Mj is the set of inflow and outflow travel strengths for city j, and \u03bcj is the set of parameters for city j, i.e., \u03bcj = [\u03b1j, \u03b2j, \u03baj, \u03b3j, \u03b4j, kl]    (2)<br/><br/>where \u03b2j is the rate at which a susceptible individual is infected by an infected individual in city j, \u03b1j is the rate at which a susceptible individual is infected by an exposed individuals in city j, \u03baj is the rate at which an exposed individual becomes infected in city j, and \u03b3j is the recovery rate in city j, kI is the possibility of an infected individual moving from one city to another, and \u03b4j is the eventual percentage of the population infected in city j. Moreover, the eventual infected population in city j is given by Njs = \u03b4jPj.<br/><br/>To facilitate comparison and matching of profiles, we introduce the normalized states as Ij(t) =\u2206 Ij(t)/Njs(t), Ej(t) =\u2206 Ej(t)/Njs(t), Sj(t) =\u2206 Sj(t)/Njs(t), and Rj(t) =\u2206 Rj(t)/Njs(t). Thus, (1) can be represented in normalized form as (3)<br/><br/>where 0 \u2264 |Xj(t)| \u2264 1.

            "The spreading of the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) has evolved from a contagion originally confined within Wuhan, China, in December 2019, rapidly to a global contagion, which has spread to 87 countries within two months. The numbers of confirmed infection cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran have surged in the last two weeks, reaching 7,313, 5,883 and 5,823, respectively, on March 8, 2020. The global fatality rate, however, remains below 3%. In this study, we build on the result of our previous work [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] that establishes a library of parameters of an augmented SEIR model, corresponding to the historic spreading profiles of 367 cities in China. This library forms a set of profile codes that cover a variety of possible epidemic progression profiles. By comparing the early incomplete data of epidemic progression collected for a specific population with the historic profiles, we select a few candidate profiles from the historic archive using a nonlinear optimization procedure. The corresponding profile codes of the selected historic progression profiles can then be used to produce estimates of the future progression for that specific population. We apply this method to predict the spreading of COVID-19 in South Korea, Italy and Iran. Results show that the three countries will soon see infection peaks in most cities in the coming 2 to 3 weeks, with South Korea\u2019s cases reaching their peaks slightly earlier than the others. The percentage of population eventually infected will be less than 0.3%, 0.05% and 0.02% for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively. The epidemic is expected to end before June 2020, and depending on the effectiveness of treatment, particular cities may see full recovery or zero infection sooner or later than others. It is worth noting that the epidemic progression in South Korean cities are found to be more rapid than typical, implying that the authorities might have taken effective measures to control the spread. The predicted progressions for Italy and Iran, on the other hand, are found to display profiles that are typical of those in the historical archive, and unless more stringent measures are taken, the peaks and subsequent decline of the infection numbers will unlikely come sooner or more rapidly than the predicted trajectories. Finally, we should stress that the proposed data-driven coding method is applicable to predicting epidemic progression in any given population and the accuracy of prediction will depend on the adequacy of the available data in allowing a reliable match to be identified from the historical archive."

            "This work applies a data-driven coding method for prediction of the COVID-19 spreading profile in any given population that shows an initial phase of epidemic progression. Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before the end of March 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city will be less than 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.02%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively.",

        "1. Introduction": [
            "The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious disease, which began to spread in China in mid December 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], and as the volume of intercity travel escalated around the Lunar New Year period, the number of infected individuals began to soar in mid January 2020. With no travel restriction in place due to the low level of vigilance or unawareness of the disease during the early phase of the outbreak, the spreading of the disease had gone almost unobstructed. Travel restriction began to be implemented throughout China since January 24, 2020, which has proven to be effective in curbing the spread of the virus. However, international traffic has not ceased and infectious",
            "Preprint submitted to medRixv.org individuals (who may or may not show any symptom at the time of travel) have actually travelled to different countries with the virus they contracted. Recent studies also show that travel restriction did contribute to the control of the spreading of COVID-19 within China as well as in a global context [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. By February 20, 2020, China had confirmed a total of 74,579 cases of COVID-19 infection, with death toll reaching 2,119. While China has begun to see declining numbers of infected cases in most cities from late February, other countries started to report surging number of cases in some cities or regions. As of March 6, 2020, the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 infection was 100,162 worldwide, with South Korea, Italy and Iran reporting surges of infected cases within two weeks. Moreover, the global mortality rate has remained around 3%.",
            "In our recent work (available on February 19, 2020) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], intercity travel data obtained from Baidu Migration [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] has been collected and integrated into the traditional SusceptibleExposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] to account for the effects of inflow and outflow traffic between 367 cities in China. Parameters of susceptible-to-exposed infection rates, exposed-to-infected infection rates, and recovery rates for 367 cities have been identified by fitting the augmented SEIR model with historical data available from the National Health Commission of China. The predicted spreading profiles of the 367 Chinese cities (which were available on February 19, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]) have been highly consistent with the actual profiles, including the times of infection peaks and the percentages of infected individuals in the 367 cities.",
            "In this work, we build on the data and estimated parameters obtained for 367 cities in our prior work [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and establish a library of profiles (sets of codes) of different spreading profiles. Suppose a new outbreak has occurred in a given population. The numbers of infected and recovered cases during the early phase of the spreading form an initial profile. This initial or incomplete profile is compared with the historical full profiles obtained previously. Then, by selecting the best fit historical profiles, we identify the candidates parameters for prediction of the future spreading profile in that given population (of a city or region). It should be emphasized that the set of historical profiles obtained previously covers various possible spreading dynamics, representing a variety of contact topologies and transmission mechanisms including the travel effects that have been integrated in the model used to capture the transmission dynamics of the 367 cities. Thus, a new outbreak in a given population would likely follow one or a combination of the profiles based on the augmented model in our previous work [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and hence can be reconstructed from the historical sets of profiles. In this work, we develop a procedure for implementing the selection of historical profiles, identification of best-fit parameters and construction of future profile. We apply the procedure to predict the epidemic progression in the cities of South Korea, Italy and Iran. Results of this study show that the spreading of COVID-19 in most cities in South Korea will peak between March 8 and March 16, 2020, and Italy will peak between March 12 and March 26, 2020, while Iran would have its peak around March 22, 2020. We also investigate the number of infected individuals in each city or region. Our method provides the average number of individuals eventually infected, along with a predicted deviation range at 95% confidence level. For Korea, we predict that Daegu and Gyeongsang North Road would have around 7,619 and 1,287 people eventually infected (i.e., 0.306% and 0.062% of the",
            "city\u2019s population), respectively, whereas the number of infected individuals in other cities in South Korea would be fewer than 300, i.e., less than 0.01% of city population. For Italy, we predict that Lombardi and Amelia Romagna would eventually have about 4,784 and 1,555 infected cases (i.e., 0.399% and 0.162 % of region\u2019s population), respectively, and the number of people eventually infected in other cities in Italy would be below 700 (<0.05% of city population). Moreover, Iran would have around 14,450 infected individuals, i.e., 0.018% of its population, of which around 2,498 and 1,698 will be expected in Tehran and Zanjan (i.e., 0.39% and 0.2% of the city\u2019s population). In addition, the number of people infected in most other cities would be fewer than 1,000 (<0.1% of the city\u2019s population). From the progression trends of the epidemic these three countries, provided control measures continue to be in place, the epidemic would come under control before the end of April 2020.",
            "In the remainder of the paper, we first introduce the official daily infection data used in this study. The augmented SEIR model is briefly reviewed, mainly to introduce the parameters of the model used for prediction of spreading profiles. The key procedure for matching historical profiles and prediction of future spreading profiles will be explained. Results of application of the proposed method to prediction of the peaks and extents of outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran will be given. Finally, we will provide a discussion of our estimation of the propagation and the reasonableness of our estimation in view of the measures taken by the authorities in controlling the spreading of this new disease.",

Moreover, the eventual infected population in city j is given by Njs = \u03b4jPj.",

The fatality rate is about 4%, which is the highest in the world. With infection cases soaring to 3,916 (as of March 6, 2020), Italy had implemented control measures to contain the spread of the virus by shutting down schools and suspending public events in regions where outbreaks were reported. The epidemic is expected to progress in a typical pace (with the present set of parameters), unless more stringent measures are in place.",

It is worth noting that the epidemic progression in South Korean cities are found to be more rapid than typical, implying that the authorities might have taken effective measures to control the spread. The predicted progressions for Italy and Iran, on the other hand, are found to display profiles that are typical of those in the historical archive, and unless more stringent measures are taken, the peaks and subsequent decline of the infection numbers will unlikely come sooner or more rapidly than the predicted trajectories. Finally, we should stress that the proposed data-driven coding method is applicable to predicting epidemic progression in any given population and the accuracy of prediction will depend on the adequacy of the available data in allowing a reliable match to be identified from the historical archive."
