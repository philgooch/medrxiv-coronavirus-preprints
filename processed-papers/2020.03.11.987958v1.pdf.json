Vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking. Here we report a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 (and SARS-CoV). This cross-neutralizing antibody targets a communal epitope on these viruses and offers potential for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

            "Expression and purification of coronavirus spike proteins. Coronavirus spike ectodomains (Secto) of SARS-CoV (residues 1\u20131,182; strain CUHK-W1; GenBank: AAP13567.1) and SARS-CoV-2 (residues 1\u20131,213; strain Wuhan-Hu-1; GenBank: QHD43416.1) were expressed transiently in HEK-293T cells with a C-terminal trimerization motif and Strep-tag using the pCAGGS expression plasmid. Similarly, pCAGGS expression vectors encoding S1 or its subdomains of SARS-CoV (S1, residues 1-676; S1A, residues 1-302; S1B, residues, 325-533), and SARS-CoV-2 (S1, residues 1-682; S1A, residues 1-294; S1B, residues 329-538) C-terminally tagged with<br/><br/>Fc domain of human or mouse IgG or Strep-tag were generated as described before[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].<br/><br/>Recombinant proteins were expressed transiently in HEK-293T cells and affinity purified from the culture supernatant by protein-A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) or streptactin beads (IBA) purification. Purity and integrity of all purified recombinant proteins was checked by coomassie stained SDS-PAGE.<br/><br/>Generation of H2L2 mAbs. H2L2 mice were sequentially immunized in two weeks intervals with purified Secto of different CoVs in the following order: HCoV-OC43, SARS-<br/><br/>CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Antigens were injected at 20-25 \u03bcg/mouse using Stimune Adjuvant (Prionics) freshly prepared according to the manufacturer instruction for first injection, while boosting was done using Ribi (Sigma) adjuvant. Injections were done subcutaneously into the left and right groin each (50 \u03bcl) and 100 \u03bcl intraperitoneally. Four days after the last injection, spleen and lymph nodes are harvested, and hybridomas made by standard method using SP 2/0 myeloma cell line (ATCC#CRL-1581) as a fusion partner. Hybridomas were screened in antigen-specific ELISA and those selected for further development, subcloned and produced on a small scale (100 ml of medium). For this purpose, hybridomas are cultured in serum- and protein-free medium for hybridoma culturing (PFHM-II (1X), Gibco) with addition of non-essential amino acids 100X NEAA, Biowhittaker Lonza, Cat BE13-114E). H2L2 antibodies were purified from hybridoma culture supernatants using Protein-A affinity chromatography. Purified antibodies were stored at 4oC until use.<br/><br/>Production of human monoclonal antibody 47D11. For recombinant human mAb production, the cDNA\u2019s encoding the 47D11 H2L2 mAb variable regions of the heavy and light chains were cloned into expression plasmids containing the human IgG1 heavy chain and Ig kappa light chain constant regions, respectively (InvivoGen). Both plasmids contain the interleukin-2 signal sequence to enable efficient secretion of recombinant antibodies. Recombinant human 47D11 mAb and previously described<br/><br/>Isotype-control (anti-Streptag mAb) or 7.7G6 mAb were produced in HEK-293T cells following transfection with pairs of the IgG1 heavy and light chain expression plasmids according to protocols from InvivoGen. Human antibodies were purified from cell culture supernatants using Protein-A affinity chromatography. Purified antibodies were stored at 4oC until use.<br/><br/>Immunofluorescence microscopy. Antibody binding to cell surface spike proteins of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was measured by immunofluoresence microscopy. HEK-293T cells seeded on glass slides were transfected with plasmids encoding SARS-S, SARS2-S or MERS-S - C-terminally fused to the green fluorescence protein (GFP) - using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days post transfection, cells were fixed by incubation with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and stained for nuclei with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were subsequently incubated with mAbs at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibodies (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 min at room temperature. The fluorescence images were recorded using a Leica SpeII confocal microscope.<br/><br/>Flow cytometry-based receptor binding inhibition assay. Antibody interference of<br/><br/>S1B binding to human ACE2 receptor on the cell surface was measured by flow cytometry. HEK-293T cells were seeded at a density of 2.5\u00d7105 cells per ml in a T75 flask. After reaching 70~80% confluency, cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding human ACE2 - C-terminally fused to the GFP - using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Two days post transfection, cells were dissociated by cell dissociation solution (Sigma-aldrich, Merck KGaA; cat. no. C5914). 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of human<br/><br/>Fc tagged SARS-S1B and SARS2-S1B was preincubated with mAb at the indicated mAb:S1B molar ratios for 1 hour on ice and subjected to flow cytometry. Single cell suspensions in FACS buffer were centrifuged at 400\u00d7g for 10 min. Cells were subsequently incubated with S1B and mAb mixture for 1 h on ice, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibodies (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis with a CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (Beckman<br/><br/>Coulter). The results were analysed by FlowJo (version 10).<br/><br/>Pseudotyped virus neutralization assay. Production of VSV pseudotyped with<br/><br/>SARS-S and SARS2-S was performed as described previously with some adaptations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Briefly, HEK-293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS expression vectors encoding SARS-S or SARS2-S carrying a 28- or 18-a.a. cytoplasmic tail truncation, respectively. One day post transfection, cells were infected with the VSV-<br/><br/>G pseudotyped VSV\u2206G bearing the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase reporter gene.<br/><br/>Twenty-four hours later, supernatants containing SARS-S/SARS2-S pseudotyped<br/><br/>VSV particles were harvested and titrated on African green monkey kidney VeroE6 cells. In the virus neutralization assay, mAbs were serially diluted at two times the desired final concentration in DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum (Bodinco), U/ml Penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml Streptomycin. Diluted mAbs were incubated with an equal volume of pseudotyped VSV particles for 1 hour at room temperature, inoculated on confluent VeroE6 monolayers in 96-well plated, and further incubated at 37\u00b0C for hours. Luciferase activity was measured on a Berthold Centro LB 960 plate luminometer using D-luciferin as a substrate (Promega). The percentage of infectivity was calculated as ratio of luciferase readout in the presence of mAbs normalized to luciferase readout in the absence of mAb. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined using 4-parameter logistic regression (GraphPad Prism version    8).<br/><br/>Virus neutralization assay. Neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) as described earlier, with some modifications[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. In brief, mAbs were two-fold serially diluted and mixed with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour. The mixture was then added to<br/><br/>VeroE6 cells and incubated for 1 hr, after which the cells were washed and further incubated in medium for 8 hrs. The cells were then fixed and stained using a rabbit anti-SARS-CoV serum (Sino Biological) and a secondary peroxidase-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako). The signal was developed using a precipitate forming TMB substrate (True Blue, KPL) and the number of infected cells per well were counted using the ImmunoSpot\u00ae Image analyzer (CTL Europe GmbH). The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined using 4-parameter logistic regression (GraphPad Prism version 8).<br/><br/>ELISA analysis of antibody binding to CoV spike antigens. NUNC Maxisorp plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with equimolar antigen amounts at 4\u00b0C overnight.<br/><br/>Plates were washed three times with Phosphate Saline Buffer (PBS) containing 0.05%<br/><br/>Tween-20 and blocked with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in PBS containing 0.1%<br/><br/>Tween-20 at room temperature for 2 hours. Four-folds serial dilutions of mAbs starting at 10 \u03bcg/ml (diluted in blocking buffer) were added and plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed three times and incubated with HRP-<br/><br/>conjugated goat anti-human secondary antibody (ITK Southern Biotech) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. An HRP-conjugated anti-StrepMAb (IBA, Cat.no: 2-1509-001) antibody was used to corroborate equimolar coating of the<br/><br/>Strep-tagged spike antigens. HRP activity was measured at 450 nanometer using tetramethylbenzidine substrate (BioFX) and an ELISA plate reader (EL-808, Biotek).<br/><br/>Half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) binding values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis on the binding curves using GraphPad Prism (version 8).

SARS-S targeting hybridomas were developed by conventional hybridoma technology from immunized H2L2 transgenic mice (Harbour Biomed), as described before[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. These mice - carrying genes encoding the heavy and light chain human immunoglobulin repertoire - were sequentially immunized with 2-week intervals with trimeric spike protein ectodomains (Secto) of three human coronaviruses from the betacoronavirus genus in the following order: 1. HCoV-OC43-Secto, 2. SARS-CoV-Secto, 3. MERS-CoVSecto, 4. HCoV-OC43-Secto, 5. SARS-CoV-Secto, 6. MERS-CoV-Secto. Four days after the last immunization, splenocytes and lymph node lymphocytes were harvested and hybridomas were generated. Antibodies in the cell supernatants were tested for<br/><br/>ELISA-reactivity against SARS-Secto, SARS-S1, SARS-S1A and SARS2-S1. Of the hybridoma supernatants that reacted with SARS-Secto only, 23 reacted with<br/><br/>SARS-S1A, 22 with SARS-S1 but not SARS-S1A, 6 with SARS-Secto but not SARSS1.
