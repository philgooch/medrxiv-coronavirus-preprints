Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for HCoV-191,2, the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. RmYN02 shared 93.3% nucleotide identity with HCoV-19 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene in which it was the closest relative of HCoV-19. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin39 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, however, and in a similar manner to HCoV-19, 40 RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the",

            "The unprecedented epidemic of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, HCoV-19, in<br/><br/>China and beyond has caused public health concern at a global scale. Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for HCoV-19 , the origins of the virus remain unclear.<br/><br/>Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. RmYN02 shared 93.3% nucleotide identity with HCoV-19 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene in which it was the closest relative of HCoV-19. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to<br/><br/>HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, however, and in a similar manner to HCoV-19, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the<br/><br/>S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur in nature. Together, these data suggest that HCoV-19 originated from multiple naturally occurring recombination events among those viruses present in bats and other wildlife species.    Text<br/><br/>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are common viral respiratory pathogens that primarily cause symptoms in the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In 1960s, two CoVs, 229E and OC43, were identified in clinical samples from patients experiencing the common cold . More recently, four additional human CoVs have been successively identified: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, NL63 in late 2004, HKU1 in January 2005, and<br/><br/>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. However, only two betacoronaviruses (beta-CoVs), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are able to cause severe and fatal infections, leading to 774 and 858 deaths, respectively, suggesting that beta-CoVs may be of particular concern to human health. In December 2019, viral pneumonia caused by an unidentified microbial agent was reported, which was soon identified to be a novel coronavirus , now termed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of<br/><br/>Viruses and HCoV-19 by a group of Chinese scientists . The number of patients infected with<br/><br/>HCoV-19 has increased sharply since January 21, 2020, and as of March 2rd, 2020, more than<br/><br/>80,000 confirmed HCoV-19 cases have been reported, with >11,000 severe cases and >2900 deaths in China. By the end of January confirmed HCoV-19 cases were present in all the<br/><br/>Chinese provinces and municipalities and at the time of writing the virus has been detected in over 60 countries.<br/><br/>An epidemiological survey of several HCoV-19 cases at an early stage of the outbreak revealed that most had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city prior to illness, where various wild animals were on sale before it was closed on January 1, 2020 due to the outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that HCoV-19 is a novel beta-CoV distinct from<br/><br/>SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV identified from a Rhinolophus affinis bat sampled in Yunnan province in 2013 . This virus shared 96.1% nucleotide identity and 92.9% identity in the S gene, again suggesting that bats play a key role as coronavirus reservoirs . Notably, however, two research groups recently reported several novel beta-CoVs related to HCoV-19 in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) that were illegally imported into Guangxi (GX) and Guangdong (GD) provinces, southern<br/><br/>China . Although these pangolins CoVs are more distant to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 across the virus genome as a whole, they are very similar to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, including at the amino acid residues thought to mediate binding to<br/><br/>ACE2 . It is therefore possible that pangolins play an important role in the ecology and evolution of CoVs, although whether they act as intermediate hosts for HCoV-19 is currently unclear. Indeed, the discovery of viruses in pangolins suggests that there is a wide diversity of CoVs still to be sampled in wildlife, some of which may be directly involved in the emergence of HCoV-19.<br/><br/>. To date, the most closely related virus to HCoV-2019 is RaTG13, Between May and October, 2019, we collected a total of 302 samples from 227 bats from<br/><br/>Mengla County, Yunnan Province in southern China (Extended Data Table 1). These bats belonged to 20 different species, with the majority of samples from Rhinolophus malayanus (n=48, 21.1%), Hipposideros larvatus (n=41, 18.1%) and Rhinolophus stheno (n=39, 17.2%). The samples comprised multiple tissues, including patagium (n=219), lung (n=2) and liver (n=3), and feces (n=78). All but three bats were sampled alive and subsequently released. Based on the bat species primarily identified according to morphological criteria and confirmed through DNA barcoding, the 224 tissues and 78 feces were merged into 38 and 18 pools, respectively, with each pool including 1 to 11 samples of the same type (Extended Data Table<br/><br/>1). These pooled samples were then used for next generation sequencing (NGS).<br/><br/>Using next-generation metagenomic sequencing we successfully obtained 11954 and 64224 reads in pool No 39 (from a total of 78,477,464 clean reads) that mapped to a SARS-like bat coronavirus, Cp/Yunnan2011 (JX993988), and to HCoV-19. From this, we generated two preliminary consensus sequences. Pool 39 comprised 11 feces from Rhinolophus malayanus collected between May 6 and July 30, 2019. After a series of verification steps, including remapping and Sanger sequencing (Extended Data Table 2 and Figures 1-3), one partial (23395 bp) and one complete (29671 bp) beta-CoV genome sequences were obtained and termed<br/><br/>BetaCoV/Rm/Yunnan/YN01/2019<br/><br/>(RmYN02), respectively. Notably, 20 positions in the RmYN02 genome displayed nucleotide polymorphisms in the NGS data, although these did not include the S1/S2 cleavage site (Extended Data Figure 3). Only a few reads in the remaining 55 pools could be mapped to (RmYN01)    and<br/><br/>BetaCoV/Rm/Yunnan/YN02/2019<br/><br/>the reference CoV genomes. The sequence identity between RmYN01 and Cp/Yunnan2011 across the aligned regions was 96.9%, whereas that between RmYN01 and HCoV-19 was only<br/><br/>79.7% across the aligned regions and 70.4% in the spike gene.<br/><br/>In contrast, RmYN02 was closely related to HCoV-19, exhibiting 93.3% nucleotide sequence identity, although it was less similar to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 (96.1%) across the genome as a whole (Fig. 1a). RmYN02 and HCoV-19 were extremely similar (>96% sequence identity) in most genomic regions (e.g. 1ab, 3a, E, 6, 7a, N and 10) (Fig. 1a). In particular, RmYN02 was<br/><br/>97.2% identical to HCoV-19 in the longest encoding gene region, 1ab (n=21285). However, RmYN02 exhibited far lower sequence identity to HCoV-19 in the S gene (nucleotide 71.8%, amino acid 72.9%), compared to 97.4% amino acid identity between RaTG13 and HCoV-19<br/><br/>(Fig. 1a). Strikingly, RmYN02 only possessed 62.4% amino acid identity to HCoV-19 in the RBD, whereas the pangolin beta-CoV from Guangdong had amino acid identity of 97.4% , and was the closest relative of HCoV-19 in this region. A similarity plot estimated using Simplot also revealed that RmYN02 was more similar to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 in most genome regions (Fig. 1b). Again, in the RBD, the pangolin/MP789/2019 virus shared the highest sequence identity to HCoV-19 (Fig. 1c)."

In the spike gene tree, HCoV-19 clustered with RaTG13 and was distant from RmYN02, suggesting that the latter virus has experienced recombination in this gene (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Figure 6). In phylogeny of the RBD, HCoV-19 was most closely related to pangolin-CoV/GD, with the bat viruses falling in more divergent positions, again indicative of recombination (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Figure 7).",
