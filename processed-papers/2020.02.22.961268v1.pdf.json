        "abstract": "The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originating from Wuhan, China, draws worldwide concerns due to its long incubation period and strong infectivity. Although RT-PCR-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. To address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19 causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2. This method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RT-PCR reactions. The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 105 copies of SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved. Benefitting from the simplicity and excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turnaround time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of COVID19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.",

            "In December, 2019, an unknown pathogen-mediated pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Confirmed cases had been soon diagnosed in other cities in China, as well as in other countries. On 11 February 2020, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), this unknown pneumonia was confirmed to be caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2, previously named as 2019-nCoV). SARS-CoV-2 is etiologically related to the wellknown severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), belonging to the Coronaviridae family, a type of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus with an outer envelope. Although the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have been fully revealed and various RT-PCR-based detection kits have been developed, clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is still highly challenging.<br/><br/>Due to its high sensitivity in exponentially amplifying RNA molecules, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is identified as a standard and routinely used technique for the analysis and quantification of various pathogenic RNA in laboratories and clinical diagnosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] For example, it has been successfully applied for the detection of SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), and various other viral pathogens including Zika virus (ZIKV), Influenza A virus, Dengue virus (DENV).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] After the outbreak of COVID-19, several methods and kits based on RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA have been reported.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] While RT-PCR-based methods have been widely used in COVID-19 diagnosis, their application in accurate diagnosis of viral infection and epidemic control is severely hampered by their laborious and time-consuming sample processing steps.<br/><br/>Quantitative extraction of nucleic acids with high purity from complex samples are the prerequisite for efficient RT-PCR assays. Low extraction efficiency might give poor signals during exponential amplification and thus result in false negative results.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Low extraction quality, on the other hand, may contain a variety of PCR inhibitors, which gives unreliable readouts during amplification.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]<br/><br/>In the control and diagnosis towards SARS-CoV-2 currently, silica-based spin column RNA extraction methods are widely used, in which a silica membrane or glass fiber is applied to bind nucleic acids. In these traditional methods, the samples need pre-lysis in an appropriate buffer to release nucleic acids from viral particles before binding to the column membrane and multiple centrifugation steps are required to enable binding, washing and elution of extracted nucleic acids. Additionally, as various corrosive chaotropic salts and toxic organic solvents are involved in the lysis and binding steps, several sequential washing steps are required to eliminate possible PCR inhibitory effects in the eluted products. The whole process comprises multiple centrifuging and column-transferring steps, which is laborious, time-consuming, and vulnerable to contamination or column clogging. More importantly, spin column-based approaches are not suitable for a high-throughput, automated operation. In the monitoring and control of sudden outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, these traditional methods consume a large number of operators, but giving low diagnosis efficiency and high risk of cross infection. Thus, fast, convenient and automated nucleic acids extraction methods are highly desirable not just in the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, but also in the monitoring and prevention of other infectious diseases.<br/><br/>As an alternative, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)-based extraction methods are centrifuge-free and has proven to be easy to operate and compatible to automation and high-throughput operation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] In conventional MNPs-based methods, nucleic acids in the lysed samples can be specifically absorbed on MNPs due to various surfacemodified functional groups. In the presence of magnetic fields, nucleic acids are rapidly separated from most impurities in the supernatant. After fast washing steps to eliminate trace impurities, purified nucleic acids can be further released from the surface of MNPs by elution buffer with altered ionic strength. Although much simpler and faster than spin column-based methods, most MNPs-based extraction strategies still contain multiple processing steps such as lysis, binding, washing and elution, which increases operational difficulties in real clinical diagnosis.<br/><br/>Herein, a further simplified and updated MNPs-based viral RNA extraction method is described for highly sensitive extraction and RT-PCR detection of viral RNA using SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses as models. The MNPs is synthesized via a simple one-pot approach, and functionalized with polymers carrying multi-carboxyl groups by following one-step incubation. Due to the strong interaction between carboxyl groups and nucleic acids, the poly carboxyl-functionalized MNPs (pcMNPs) enables rapid and efficient absorption of RNA molecules. In RNA extraction, one lysis/binding step and one washing step are required for nucleic acids extraction and purification from complex samples. More importantly, extracted RNA can be directed introduced into subsequent RT-PCR together with MB without elution step, which dramatically reduce operating time and risk of contamination. The fast extraction method was verified by both manual operation and automated system. Due to its simplicity, satisfactory performances and robustness, this method provides a promising alternative to decrease the labour-intensity and reduce possibility of false-negative results in current RT-PCRbased SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis."

Both iron solutions were then mixed in a 500 mL round-bottom flask, and 10 mL of ammonium hydroxide was added into the mixture with vigorous stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere. A rapid change of solution colour was observed from orange to black, indicating the formation of co-precipitated bare MNPs. The solution mixture was continuously stirred for another 4 h, and the resulting black products (bare MNPs) were collected with a magnet and dispersed into ethanol after washing several times with deionized water and ethanol. Subsequently, 0.3 g of as-prepared bare MNPs, 15 mL of deionized water and 12 mL of ammonium hydroxide were added into 150 mL of ethanol, followed by a continuous sonication for 30 min at room temperature. 1.2 mL of TEOS was then added dropwise into the solution mixture after sonication, and vigorously stirred for another 4 h at room temperature to allow the formation of silica layers on the surface of MNPs. Afterwards, the silica-coated MNPs were collected with a magnet and the rinsed with deionized water and ethanol for several times to remove residual TEOS. After that, 0.2 g of silica-coated MNPs were dispersed into 50 mL isopropanol, and 0.2 mL of APTES was dropwise mixed with MNPs solution. The mixture was incubated under continuous sonication for 6 h at room temperature, followed by the collection of amino-modified MNPs (NH2-MNPs) with a magnet and washing with deionized water and ethanol to remove free APTES. The final prepared NH2-MNPs were preserved in ethanol at 4 oC and the loading of -NH2 group on the surface was verified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (FigureS1A).<br/><br/>Synthesis and characterization of poly (amino ester) with multiple carboxyl groups (PC)<br/><br/>As shown in Scheme[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] A, polymers were prepared based on the protocol reported previously with minor modification.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] In brief, 3.5 g of 1,4-butanediol diacrylate (17.7 mmol) and 1.5 g of 6-amino caproic acid (11.4 mmol) were firstly mixed in 10 mL of<br/><br/>50% (v/v) DMSO aqueous solution, followed by vigorously stirring for 12 h at 90 \u00b0C in a safe dark place. Subsequently, end-capping reaction was performed by the addition of 10% (v/v) amino solution, ethylenediamine, into the polymer/DMSO solution. The as-prepared PC polymers was final preserved at 4 \u00b0C with lightproof package. PCs were further characterized by FTIR spectroscopy (FigureS1B).<br/><br/>Preparation and characterization of PC-coated NH2-MNPs (pcMNPs) 25 mg of NH2-MNPs were dispersed into 25 mL of 50% (v/v) DMSO aqueous solution and then mixed with 1.25 g of PC under sonication for 10 min. Subsequently, 2.5 mL of NaOH solution (1 M) was introduced to the mixture and sonicated for another 20 min, followed by vigorously shaking for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C and rinsing with DMSO and deionized water for several times. The obtained polymer-coated MNPs (pcMNPs) were stored in deionized water at 4 \u00b0C. The size and morphology of the pcMNPs were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).<br/><br/>Common nucleic acid extraction The pseudovirus samples were obtained from Zeesan Biotech (Xiamen, China) and the standard samples were freshly prepared by step-wise dilution of pseudovirus in fetal calf serum purchased from Thermofisher (Massachusetts, USA) before nucleic acid extraction experiments. 200 \u03bcL of as-prepared standard samples with a known copy number of viral particles (down to 10 copies) were incubated with 400 \u03bcL lysis/binding buffer (1 M NaI, 2.5 M NaCl, 10% Triton X-100, 40% polyethylene glycol 8000, 25 mM EDTA) and 40 \u03bcg pcMNPs for 10 min at room temperature on a rotating shaker. Then, the pcMNPs-RNA complex was collected magnetically for 1 min and the supernatant was discarded. Afterwards, the complex was washed once or twice with 400 \u03bcL washing buffer (75% ethanol v/v). The purified nucleic acids were released from MNPs by incubating the complex in 50 \u03bcL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), vortexed at 55 oC bath for 5 min, and 15 \u03bcL of supernatant was transferred to subsequent RT-PCR reaction.<br/><br/>Conventional Real-time reverse-transcription PCR To quantify the amount of viral RNA captured, Real-time reverse-transcription PCR using VetMAXTM-Plus One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Massachusetts, USA) and Bio-Red PCR detection system (California, USA) was applied.

Then the washing buffer and elution buffer was added separately into Column 2 or 4. Finally, the 96-well sample plate was plugged onto the matrix and RNA extraction was performed by following an optimized program (TableS1). Once the program was finished, the 96-well sample plate was removed and the 15 \u03bcL of the eluted product was analysed using the conventional RT-PCR protocol as described above."

            "<strong>Results and discussion</strong><br/><br/>Synthesis and characterization of pcMNPs<br/><br/>The pcMNPs were prepared by two steps as depicted in Scheme1B. It started with one-pot synthesis of NH2-MNPs using co-precipitation reaction and hydrolysis of TEOS/APTES. Once PC polymer was successfully synthesized, its reaction with NH2MNPs would form pcMNPs by the Michael addition to efficiently give pcMNPs. To investigate the morphology of prepared pcMNPs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used and the representative image was shown in Figure1A, suggesting a spherical morphology of the prepared pcMNPs. In addition, enlarged TEM image of pcMNPs revealed a thin silica-layer on the particle surfaces with a thickness around 3 nm, implied the successful preparation of silica-coating. By using the dynamic light scattering technique, it is observed that the prepared pcMNPs have an average diameter of 10.22 \u00b1 2.8 nm without apparent aggregation (Figure1B). To verify the successful functionalization of synthesized PC polymers, the average zeta potentials of bare MNPs, silica-coated MNPs and pcMNPs were measured by DLS. As shown in Fig 1C, the average zeta potential changed from -4.82 mV \u00b1 0.54 of bare MNPs to 20.57 mV \u00b1 0.71 of silica-coated MNPs due to the NH2- groups introduced during silica-coating. However, functionalization of PC polymers resulted in a decrease of average zeta potential of pcMNPs to -38.67 mV \u00b1 0.84, indicating successful polymer coating and more importantly, good dispersion of pcMNPs in the solution. Subsequently, the magnetic response property of bare MNPs, NH2-MNPs and pcMNPs were tested (Figure1D). The magnetically capture process was completely finished within 30 s, implying excellent paramagnetic property of the prepared pcMNPs.

As shown in Figure2A, more than 90% of RNA was absorbed by the pcMNPs within 10 min. In contrast, significant amount RNA molecules have been observed using a commercialized RNA extraction kit under similar conditions. More importantly, no aggregation has been observed when incubating pxMNPs in a high-salt solution (50 mM NaCl), further confirmed their excellent dispersity (Figure2B).<br/><br/>Figure[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] RNA binding and dispersion property of pcMNPs.

We first carried out a concentration optimization of the primer and probe to maximize the efficiency and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection. The results showed that the optimal concentrations were 1 \u03bcM and 1 \u03bcM for the primer pairs and probes respectively (FigureS2). Subsequently, the optimal amount of pcMNPs in viral RNA extraction were evaluated. Considering the high viral load in clinical samples, although 20 \u03bcg of pcMNPs were enough to extract 105 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus RNA in 200 \u03bcL serum samples (FigureS3), 40 \u03bcg pcMNPs was used in subsequent experiments.<br/><br/>Applications of pcMNPs in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using Direct RT-PCR<br/><br/>Flu o re scence in te n s ity (A .U ) F lu o re scence in te n s ity (A .U )    A 10000<br/><br/>N e g a tiv e P o s itiv eConven tio nalRT -P C R D ire ct R T -P C R    C y c le<br/><br/>Figure[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] RT-PCR assays towards viral RNA extracted by different pcMNPs-based methods. RT-PCR assays amplifying (A) the ORF1ab region and (B) the N gene in pseudoviral RNA extracted by a manual protocol.<br/><br/>Due to the excellent water dispersity of pcMNPs, we hypothesized that they can stay dispersed in the first few cycles of RT-PCR reaction, without shielding the extracted RNA molecules in aggregates from primer binding and elongation. Thus, by following the optimized conditions, performances of the pcMNPs-based RNA extraction and Direct RT-PCR was investigated. 105 copies of pseudoviruses were spiked into 200 \u03bcL of serum and the extracted viral RNA were analysed by RT-PCR using eluted products (Conventional RT-PCR) or pcMNPs-RNA complexes without elution (Direct RT-PCR). In these experiments, the serum sample without pseudoviruses was used as a negative control, while the PCR reaction mixture directly spiked with 105 copies of pseudoviruses was regarded as a positive control. As shown in Figure3A, in the detection of ORFlab (Open Reading Frame 1ab) region, the direct RT-PCR without elution step exhibited a slightly smaller cycle threshold (Ct) value than that measured using Conventional RT-PCR after elution. This is possibly because all extracted viral RNA was introduced to the amplification in the Direct RT-PCR, while only half of the eluted products was added for the Conventional RT-PCR. This phenomenon suggests that one advantages of the pcMNPs-based Direct RT-PCR protocol is to reduce possible false negative results, since all extracted viral RNA has been directed to the subsequent amplification without potential lost in the elution and transfer steps. Additionally, there is no detectable differences between amplification efficiencies of the positive control and Direct RT-PCR (Figure3A red and purple lines). This result suggests that our pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction protocol not only exhibits nearly 100% RNA extraction efficiency in serum samples, but also provides high-purity products without PCR inhibitors.<br/><br/>Automated viral RNA extraction based on pcMNPs As previously described, one of the most serious disadvantages of traditional columnbased extraction approaches is the difficulties in automation. Because no centrifugation steps are required, MNPs-based methods allow fully automated nucleic acid purification, which is highly important in current SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Therefore, the feasibility of automating viral RNA extraction procedure based on our pcMNPs was subsequently evaluated. A commercialized magnetic rods-based nucleic acid purification system was used. An automated programme was set according to the manual protocol (Figure4A). During the extraction process, although the shaking pattern of magnetic rods was set at the most vigorous level, no breakage or leakage of pcMNPs were observed, since the eluted solution are colourless and transparent (FigureS4). As shown in Figure4B, the amplification curve of the automated sample is very close to that of the positive control and manually performed Direct RT-PCR samples, which suggests that our pcMNPs-based method is highly suitable for the automated high throughput viral RNA extraction.

A series of standard samples containing 105 to 10 copies of pseudovirus were freshly prepared by step-wise 10-fold dilution of in serum. A control serum sample (no pseudovirus) was also included as a negative control to monitor the presence of false positive signals. As shown in Figure 5A, a detection limit of 10 copies of pseudovirus was achieved using Convectional RT-PCR protocol. A strong linear relationship between the logarithm of pseudovirus particle numbers and the corresponding Ct values was found crossing over 5 orders of magnitude ranging from 10 to 105 copies with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.999) (Figure5B). Parallelly, similar detection limit and linear relationship were observed in experiments following the pcMNPs-based Direct RT-PCR protocol (Figure5C and D). Meanwhile, the differences of Ct values between neighbouring curves are approximately 3 cycles, which is very close to the theoretical 3.3 cycles for a 10-fold dilution. These results indicated that the RT-PCR amplification is highly efficient both in the presence or absence of pcMNPs. However, it is also important to note that in both cases, the negative controls sometimes gave observable amplification signals. Although their Ct values are lagged too far behind 40 cycles to be regarded as a valid positive result, this phenomenon raise concerns about possible false-positive issues, in which further optimization of primer pairs and probe might be necessary.<br/><br/>Overall, the updated MB-based extraction method had highly extraction efficiency and compatibility of PCR amplification in any of the patterns, which dramatically simplified laborious sample processing work and was ideally suitable for RT-PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 with a sensitivity of 10 copies at least."

For example, although the genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 have been fully revealed and various RT-PCR-based detection kits have been developed, timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is still highly challenging partially due to the lack of satisfactory viral RNA extraction strategy. In this study, a carboxyl polymer-coated MNPs, namely pcMNPs, was developed and a simple but efficient viral RNA extraction system was established for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via RT-PCR. As compared with traditional column-based nucleic acids extraction methods, our pcMNPs-based method has several advantages (Table 2). Firstly, pcMNPs-based method combines the virus lysis and RNA binding steps into one, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RTPCR reactions (Direct RT-PCR), which gives a dramatically simplified RNA extraction protocol. Secondly, pcMNPs have excellent viral RNA binding performances, which results in 10-copy sensitivity and the high linearity over 5 logs of gradient in SARSCoV-2 viral RNA detection using RT-PCR. Thirdly, this method can be easily adopted in fully automated nucleic acid extraction systems without laborious optimization. Furthermore, the pcMNPs-RNA complexes obtained by this method is also compatible with various isothermal amplification methods, such as RPA and LAMP, and thus could be used in the development of POCT devices. In conclusion, due to its simplicity, robustness, and excellent performances, our pcMNPs-based method may provide a promising alternative to solve the laborious and time-consuming viral RNA extraction operations, and thus exhibits a great potential in the high throughput SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis.

        "Introduction": [
            "In December, 2019, an unknown pathogen-mediated pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Confirmed cases had been soon diagnosed in other cities in China, as well as in other countries. On 11 February 2020, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), this unknown pneumonia was confirmed to be caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2, previously named as 2019-nCoV). SARS-CoV-2 is etiologically related to the wellknown severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), belonging to the Coronaviridae family, a type of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus with an outer envelope. Although the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have been fully revealed and various RT-PCR-based detection kits have been developed, clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is still highly challenging.",
            "Due to its high sensitivity in exponentially amplifying RNA molecules, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is identified as a standard and routinely used technique for the analysis and quantification of various pathogenic RNA in laboratories and clinical diagnosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] For example, it has been successfully applied for the detection of SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), and various other viral pathogens including Zika virus (ZIKV), Influenza A virus, Dengue virus (DENV).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] After the outbreak of COVID-19, several methods and kits based on RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA have been reported.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] While RT-PCR-based methods have been widely used in COVID-19 diagnosis, their application in accurate diagnosis of viral infection and epidemic control is severely hampered by their laborious and time-consuming sample processing steps.",
            "Quantitative extraction of nucleic acids with high purity from complex samples are the prerequisite for efficient RT-PCR assays. Low extraction efficiency might give poor signals during exponential amplification and thus result in false negative results.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Low extraction quality, on the other hand, may contain a variety of PCR inhibitors, which gives unreliable readouts during amplification.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]",
            "In the control and diagnosis towards SARS-CoV-2 currently, silica-based spin column RNA extraction methods are widely used, in which a silica membrane or glass fiber is applied to bind nucleic acids. In these traditional methods, the samples need pre-lysis in an appropriate buffer to release nucleic acids from viral particles before binding to the column membrane and multiple centrifugation steps are required to enable binding, washing and elution of extracted nucleic acids. Additionally, as various corrosive chaotropic salts and toxic organic solvents are involved in the lysis and binding steps, several sequential washing steps are required to eliminate possible PCR inhibitory effects in the eluted products. The whole process comprises multiple centrifuging and column-transferring steps, which is laborious, time-consuming, and vulnerable to contamination or column clogging. More importantly, spin column-based approaches are not suitable for a high-throughput, automated operation. In the monitoring and control of sudden outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, these traditional methods consume a large number of operators, but giving low diagnosis efficiency and high risk of cross infection. Thus, fast, convenient and automated nucleic acids extraction methods are highly desirable not just in the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, but also in the monitoring and prevention of other infectious diseases.",
            "As an alternative, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)-based extraction methods are centrifuge-free and has proven to be easy to operate and compatible to automation and high-throughput operation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] In conventional MNPs-based methods, nucleic acids in the lysed samples can be specifically absorbed on MNPs due to various surfacemodified functional groups. In the presence of magnetic fields, nucleic acids are rapidly separated from most impurities in the supernatant. After fast washing steps to eliminate trace impurities, purified nucleic acids can be further released from the surface of MNPs by elution buffer with altered ionic strength. Although much simpler and faster than spin column-based methods, most MNPs-based extraction strategies still contain multiple processing steps such as lysis, binding, washing and elution, which increases operational difficulties in real clinical diagnosis.",
            "Herein, a further simplified and updated MNPs-based viral RNA extraction method is described for highly sensitive extraction and RT-PCR detection of viral RNA using SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses as models. The MNPs is synthesized via a simple one-pot approach, and functionalized with polymers carrying multi-carboxyl groups by following one-step incubation. Due to the strong interaction between carboxyl groups and nucleic acids, the poly carboxyl-functionalized MNPs (pcMNPs) enables rapid and efficient absorption of RNA molecules. In RNA extraction, one lysis/binding step and one washing step are required for nucleic acids extraction and purification from complex samples. More importantly, extracted RNA can be directed introduced into subsequent RT-PCR together with MB without elution step, which dramatically reduce operating time and risk of contamination. The fast extraction method was verified by both manual operation and automated system. Due to its simplicity, satisfactory performances and robustness, this method provides a promising alternative to decrease the labour-intensity and reduce possibility of false-negative results in current RT-PCRbased SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis."

Subsequently, 0.3 g of as-prepared bare MNPs, 15 mL of deionized water and 12 mL of ammonium hydroxide were added into 150 mL of ethanol, followed by a continuous sonication for 30 min at room temperature. 1.2 mL of TEOS was then added dropwise into the solution mixture after sonication, and vigorously stirred for another 4 h at room temperature to allow the formation of silica layers on the surface of MNPs. Afterwards, the silica-coated MNPs were collected with a magnet and the rinsed with deionized water and ethanol for several times to remove residual TEOS. After that, 0.2 g of silica-coated MNPs were dispersed into 50 mL isopropanol, and 0.2 mL of APTES was dropwise mixed with MNPs solution. The mixture was incubated under continuous sonication for 6 h at room temperature, followed by the collection of amino-modified MNPs (NH2-MNPs) with a magnet and washing with deionized water and ethanol to remove free APTES. The final prepared NH2-MNPs were preserved in ethanol at 4 oC and the loading of -NH2 group on the surface was verified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (FigureS1A).",

        "Results and discussion": [
            "The pcMNPs were prepared by two steps as depicted in Scheme1B. It started with one-pot synthesis of NH2-MNPs using co-precipitation reaction and hydrolysis of TEOS/APTES. Once PC polymer was successfully synthesized, its reaction with NH2MNPs would form pcMNPs by the Michael addition to efficiently give pcMNPs. To investigate the morphology of prepared pcMNPs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used and the representative image was shown in Figure1A, suggesting a spherical morphology of the prepared pcMNPs. In addition, enlarged TEM image of pcMNPs revealed a thin silica-layer on the particle surfaces with a thickness around 3 nm, implied the successful preparation of silica-coating. By using the dynamic light scattering technique, it is observed that the prepared pcMNPs have an average diameter of 10.22 \u00b1 2.8 nm without apparent aggregation (Figure1B). To verify the successful functionalization of synthesized PC polymers, the average zeta potentials of bare MNPs, silica-coated MNPs and pcMNPs were measured by DLS. As shown in Fig 1C, the average zeta potential changed from -4.82 mV \u00b1 0.54 of bare MNPs to 20.57 mV \u00b1 0.71 of silica-coated MNPs due to the NH2- groups introduced during silica-coating. However, functionalization of PC polymers resulted in a decrease of average zeta potential of pcMNPs to -38.67 mV \u00b1 0.84, indicating successful polymer coating and more importantly, good dispersion of pcMNPs in the solution. Subsequently, the magnetic response property of bare MNPs, NH2-MNPs and pcMNPs were tested (Figure1D). The magnetically capture process was completely finished within 30 s, implying excellent paramagnetic property of the prepared pcMNPs.",

We first carried out a concentration optimization of the primer and probe to maximize the efficiency and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection. The results showed that the optimal concentrations were 1 \u03bcM and 1 \u03bcM for the primer pairs and probes respectively (FigureS2). Subsequently, the optimal amount of pcMNPs in viral RNA extraction were evaluated. Considering the high viral load in clinical samples, although 20 \u03bcg of pcMNPs were enough to extract 105 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus RNA in 200 \u03bcL serum samples (FigureS3), 40 \u03bcg pcMNPs was used in subsequent experiments.",

            "Due to the excellent water dispersity of pcMNPs, we hypothesized that they can stay dispersed in the first few cycles of RT-PCR reaction, without shielding the extracted RNA molecules in aggregates from primer binding and elongation. Thus, by following the optimized conditions, performances of the pcMNPs-based RNA extraction and Direct RT-PCR was investigated. 105 copies of pseudoviruses were spiked into 200 \u03bcL of serum and the extracted viral RNA were analysed by RT-PCR using eluted products (Conventional RT-PCR) or pcMNPs-RNA complexes without elution (Direct RT-PCR). In these experiments, the serum sample without pseudoviruses was used as a negative control, while the PCR reaction mixture directly spiked with 105 copies of pseudoviruses was regarded as a positive control. As shown in Figure3A, in the detection of ORFlab (Open Reading Frame 1ab) region, the direct RT-PCR without elution step exhibited a slightly smaller cycle threshold (Ct) value than that measured using Conventional RT-PCR after elution. This is possibly because all extracted viral RNA was introduced to the amplification in the Direct RT-PCR, while only half of the eluted products was added for the Conventional RT-PCR. This phenomenon suggests that one advantages of the pcMNPs-based Direct RT-PCR protocol is to reduce possible false negative results, since all extracted viral RNA has been directed to the subsequent amplification without potential lost in the elution and transfer steps. Additionally, there is no detectable differences between amplification efficiencies of the positive control and Direct RT-PCR (Figure3A red and purple lines). This result suggests that our pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction protocol not only exhibits nearly 100% RNA extraction efficiency in serum samples, but also provides high-purity products without PCR inhibitors.",
            "Automated viral RNA extraction based on pcMNPs As previously described, one of the most serious disadvantages of traditional columnbased extraction approaches is the difficulties in automation. Because no centrifugation steps are required, MNPs-based methods allow fully automated nucleic acid purification, which is highly important in current SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Therefore, the feasibility of automating viral RNA extraction procedure based on our pcMNPs was subsequently evaluated. A commercialized magnetic rods-based nucleic acid purification system was used. An automated programme was set according to the manual protocol (Figure4A). During the extraction process, although the shaking pattern of magnetic rods was set at the most vigorous level, no breakage or leakage of pcMNPs were observed, since the eluted solution are colourless and transparent (FigureS4). As shown in Figure4B, the amplification curve of the automated sample is very close to that of the positive control and manually performed Direct RT-PCR samples, which suggests that our pcMNPs-based method is highly suitable for the automated high throughput viral RNA extraction.",

            "Then, the sensitivity and dynamic range of pcMNPs-based viral RNA detection method was evaluated and compared by following the Conventional and Direct RTPCR protocols, using N gene carrying pseudovirus as a model. A series of standard samples containing 105 to 10 copies of pseudovirus were freshly prepared by step-wise 10-fold dilution of in serum. A control serum sample (no pseudovirus) was also included as a negative control to monitor the presence of false positive signals. As shown in Figure 5A, a detection limit of 10 copies of pseudovirus was achieved using Convectional RT-PCR protocol. A strong linear relationship between the logarithm of pseudovirus particle numbers and the corresponding Ct values was found crossing over 5 orders of magnitude ranging from 10 to 105 copies with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.999) (Figure5B). Parallelly, similar detection limit and linear relationship were observed in experiments following the pcMNPs-based Direct RT-PCR protocol (Figure5C and D). Meanwhile, the differences of Ct values between neighbouring curves are approximately 3 cycles, which is very close to the theoretical 3.3 cycles for a 10-fold dilution. These results indicated that the RT-PCR amplification is highly efficient both in the presence or absence of pcMNPs. However, it is also important to note that in both cases, the negative controls sometimes gave observable amplification signals. Although their Ct values are lagged too far behind 40 cycles to be regarded as a valid positive result, this phenomenon raise concerns about possible false-positive issues, in which further optimization of primer pairs and probe might be necessary.",
            "Overall, the updated MB-based extraction method had highly extraction efficiency and compatibility of PCR amplification in any of the patterns, which dramatically simplified laborious sample processing work and was ideally suitable for RT-PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 with a sensitivity of 10 copies at least."

            "Efficient and robust nucleic acids extraction from complex clinical samples is the first and the most important step for subsequent molecular diagnosis, but currently it is still highly labour intensive and time-consuming. For example, although the genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 have been fully revealed and various RT-PCR-based detection kits have been developed, timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is still highly challenging partially due to the lack of satisfactory viral RNA extraction strategy. In this study, a carboxyl polymer-coated MNPs, namely pcMNPs, was developed and a simple but efficient viral RNA extraction system was established for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via RT-PCR. As compared with traditional column-based nucleic acids extraction methods, our pcMNPs-based method has several advantages (Table 2). Firstly, pcMNPs-based method combines the virus lysis and RNA binding steps into one, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RTPCR reactions (Direct RT-PCR), which gives a dramatically simplified RNA extraction protocol. Secondly, pcMNPs have excellent viral RNA binding performances, which results in 10-copy sensitivity and the high linearity over 5 logs of gradient in SARSCoV-2 viral RNA detection using RT-PCR. Thirdly, this method can be easily adopted in fully automated nucleic acid extraction systems without laborious optimization. Furthermore, the pcMNPs-RNA complexes obtained by this method is also compatible with various isothermal amplification methods, such as RPA and LAMP, and thus could be used in the development of POCT devices. In conclusion, due to its simplicity, robustness, and excellent performances, our pcMNPs-based method may provide a promising alternative to solve the laborious and time-consuming viral RNA extraction operations, and thus exhibits a great potential in the high throughput SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis.",
