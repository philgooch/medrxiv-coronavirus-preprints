        "abstract": "Introduction: More than 93,000 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported worldwide. We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 U.S. patients with COVID-19. Methods: We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by CDC during January 20\u2013February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21\u201368); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2\u20133 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARSCoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from 7/10 patients. Conclusions: In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long. Hospitalized patients showed signs of worsening in the second week after illness onset.",

            "Case identification and confirmation<br/><br/>Local health departments in consultation with clinicians identified patients under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 beginning January 17, 2020. PUI testing criteria changed during this period but included the presence of fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) and at least one epidemiologic risk factor in the two weeks before symptom onset. During January 17\u201331, epidemiologic risk factors were history of travel from Wuhan City, close contact with an ill PUI, or close contact with a patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.4,5 Beginning February 1, epidemiologic risk factors changed to close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19 or history of travel from mainland China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] During both time periods, close contact was defined as being within 6 feet for a prolonged period of time[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] or contact with respiratory secretions.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Specimens from PUIs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br/><br/>Upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal [NP], oropharyngeal [OP]) and available lower respiratory tract specimens (sputum) were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] A case of COVID-19 was defined as identification of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in \u22651 specimen from a patient. We included patients with COVID-19 who were confirmed by CDC during January 20\u2013February 5, 2020.<br/><br/>Data and follow-up specimen collection<br/><br/>Patients with COVID-19 were interviewed by public health officials to collect information on demographics, exposures, travel history, and symptoms, including signs or symptoms before presentation. For all twelve patients, available medical records were reviewed. For hospitalized patients, clinicians systematically abstracted clinical data from the medical record.<br/><br/>Illness day 1 was defined as the first day of reported COVID-19 signs and symptoms; collection date of the first SARS-CoV-2-positive specimen was used for one patient with no clear symptom onset date. When symptoms at onset or onset dates in the medical record differed from those reported from the public health interview, the latter were used. Results for virologic tests were reported relative to illness day 1. Duration of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was defined as dates of travel to China or dates of first to last exposure to a U.S patient with COVID-19. Fever was defined as subjective fever or temperature \u2265100.4 \u00b0F.<br/><br/>We requested collection of NP swabs, OP swabs, sputum (if available), serum, urine, and stool from each patient initially for every 2\u20133 days for the first 17 days of illness for SARS-CoV-2 virologic testing.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]<br/><br/>Further specimens were collected for testing if the patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 beyond day 17.<br/><br/>CDC\u2019s Human Research Protection Office determined this work was exempt from human subjects\u2019 research regulations as it involved identification, control, or prevention of disease in response to an immediate public health threat. Forms used in this response were approved under OMB, number 09201011. Data were analyzed and visualized using Excel, SAS 9.4, R 3.6.2, and Python 3.7.3.10\u201313",
            "Specimens were evaluated using SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, whole genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Virus culture was attempted from early SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory specimens (NP swabs, OP swabs, and sputum) from 9 patients. Further virus culture is ongoing. Detailed methods are included in the Appendix."

            "Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics<br/><br/>Twelve patients with confirmed COVID-19 were identified in six states. Five patients received only outpatient care and were isolated at home (Patients 1\u20135), and seven were hospitalized (Patients 6\u201312) (Figure 1). Median patient age was 53 years (range: 21\u201368); eight patients were male (Table 1). Four of five patients with \u22651 underlying medical conditions were hospitalized (Tables 1 and 2).<br/><br/>Dates of illness onset ranged from January 14 through 29. Ten patients traveled to mainland China in the two weeks before illness onset, including nine to Wuhan City. Two patients\u2019 only reported exposure was close contact with a previously identified U.S patient with COVID-19. Among all patients, the duration of potential exposure ranged from 5 days to over 1 month; the time between last date of possible exposure and illness onset ranged from 0\u20135 days.<br/><br/>The most commonly reported signs or symptoms at illness onset were cough (n=8) and subjective or measured fever (n=7) (Table 1). Two patients reported neither fever nor cough at onset, though they did develop them subsequently: one reported diarrhea as the initial symptom (one day before fever and cough), and the other reported sore throat.<br/><br/>Over the course of illness, patients reported cough (n=12), subjective or measured fever (n=9), diarrhea (n=3), and vomiting (n=2). Three patients who did not report fever were never hospitalized and remained on home isolation. Of these, one patient reported only cough and rhinorrhea; one patient reported only cough which began before travel to China and did not change from the initial onset until resolution; and one patient reported cough, chills, fatigue, headache, and nausea.<br/><br/>Clinical course of hospitalized patients<br/><br/>The clinical course for each hospitalized patient is described in the Appendix. The median duration of fever was 9 days (range: 2\u201311). Peak body temperature during hospitalization occurred at a median of illness day 9 (range: 4\u201310) (Figure 2). All hospitalized patients had oxygen saturation <94% on room air at some point during their illness, with the oxygen saturation nadir (range: 86\u201393%) occurring at a median of illness day 12 (range: 4\u201323) (Figure 2). Five patients reported difficulty breathing, and four received supplemental oxygen (Table 2; Figure 1). Patient 9 required high-flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation and intensive care monitoring.<br/><br/>Two patients received a short course (\u22643 days) of corticosteroids. Three, including one who also received corticosteroids, received the investigational antiviral remdesivir (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California) under expanded access (compassionate use) for a duration of 4\u201310 days. Following remdesivir initiation, all had transient gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, gastroparesis, or rectal bleeding. No other post-remdesivir symptoms were observed. Patient 9 reported loose stool and rectal bleeding and had traveled in Mexico before illness onset; stool later tested positive for Giardia and Clostridiodes difficile. Remdesivir was discontinued after improvement in each patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms.<br/><br/>Blood cultures were negative in 6/6 hospitalized patients tested, including those obtained from four patients treated empirically for bacterial pneumonia. Molecular testing for influenza A and B on respiratory specimens was negative, and multi-pathogen respiratory PCR panels were negative for all targets in all hospitalized patients (Table 2).<br/><br/>Laboratory and radiographic findings among hospitalized patients<br/><br/>Six of seven hospitalized patients had leukopenia (<4000 cells/\u03bcl), and the white blood cell count nadir occurred at a median of illness day 9 (range: 4\u201315) (Figure 1). Procalcitonin levels were <0.15 ng/ml in five of six patients who had levels checked. Aminotransferase levels were elevated in all hospitalized patients: AST levels peaked (median peak value 129 U/L, range 46\u2013190 U/L) at a median of illness day 13 (range 7\u201319) and ALT levels peaked (median peak value 136 U/L, range 66\u2013389 U/L) at a median of illness day 14 (range: 6\u201323). Three of seven hospitalized patients had mild elevations in alkaline phosphatase levels >115 U/L (maximum value 163 U/L). Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels >600 U/L, coinciding with clinical deterioration, were observed in two patients tested. No major elevations in serum total bilirubin (7 patients tested) or prolongations in prothrombin time (4 patients tested) were identified. Among the three remdesivir recipients, aminotransferase elevation developed in Patient 6 one day after starting remdesivir and in Patient 8 four days after starting remdesivir. Patient 9 had aminotransferase elevation at illness days 6\u20137 before starting remdesivir; aminotransferase levels started to decrease but increased again five days after starting remdesivir.<br/><br/>Unilateral or bilateral pulmonary opacities were seen on chest imaging at some point for all seven hospitalized patients (Table 2). Four hospitalized patients did not have any abnormalities identified on initial chest radiograph (illness day range: 4\u20139). Patient 7 had an abnormal chest computed tomography scan on the day of the normal chest radiograph (day 7).<br/><br/>Virologic testing<br/><br/>Initial SARS-CoV-2 testing<br/><br/>All 12 patients had respiratory specimens collected between illness days 1\u20139 (median, day 4), and all tested positive in \u22652 specimen types (Figure 3). Among initial diagnostic specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in OP (11/11 patients), NP (10/12 patients), and sputum (4/4 patients). Viable SARS-CoV-2 virus was cultured from 5/6 initial NP specimens, 4/7 initial OP specimens, 3/3 initial sputum specimens, and 1/1 additional sputum specimen collected 3 days after the initial specimens (Figure 3). Virus was cultured from two patients who were not hospitalized (Figure 3).<br/><br/>Serial SARS-CoV-2 testing<br/><br/>As of February 22, 398 specimens were collected and tested from the 12 patients throughout the course of illness. All 12 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in at least one NP swab, 11/12 in an OP swab, 6/6 in sputum, 1/12 in serum, 7/10 in stool, and 0/10 in urine (Figure 3). Among 98 pairs of simultaneous NP and OP specimens, 58 (59%) had concordant results. Among 27 discordant pairs with one positive specimen, the NP specimen was positive in 70%; the remaining 13 discordant pairs had one negative and one inconclusive specimen. Two patients provided sputum specimens when NP and/or OP specimens tested negative, and sputum continued to be positive in both patients. In Patient 7, viral RNA was detected in sputum 17 days after the last positive OP specimen and \u22652 weeks after reported symptom resolution. In seven patients who had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in stool, most detections occurred when viral RNA was still detectable in the respiratory tract. Among three patients who reported diarrhea, all had viral RNA detected in stool.<br/><br/>Mean Ct values in positive specimens were 17.0\u201339.0 for NP, 22.1\u201339.7 for OP, and 24.1\u201339.4 for stool. Ct values were lower in the first week of illness than the second in most patients (Figure S1); in some patients, low Ct values continued into the 2nd and 3rd week of illness. There was no apparent relationship between Ct values in the upper respiratory tract and disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR results turned positive in serum of Patient 9 in the second week of illness at the time of rapid clinical deterioration.<br/><br/>Serial testing to determine duration of RNA detection and viral shedding is ongoing. As of February 22, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected at a maximum of day 26 in NP specimens, day 26 in OP, day 29 in sputum, and day 25 in stool (Figure 3). The duration of viral RNA detection did not differ by hospitalization status or supplemental oxygen requirement.    Outcomes<br/><br/>As of February 22, all patients reported symptom resolution (Figure 1). Eleven patients reported cough, (often intermittent) as the last symptom. Median symptom duration was 14 days (range: 6\u201320). SARSCoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in 7/11 patients, including in NP (n=6), OP (n=2), sputum (n=1), and stool (n=3) specimens. As of February 22, one patient remained hospitalized, and five patients remained on home isolation. Home isolation was discontinued for 6 patients per CDC criteria;[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] the last respiratory specimens with a positive or inconclusive test result were collected from these patients on days 12\u201329.<br/><br/>Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis<br/><br/>Complete genome sequences were generated from respiratory specimens from all 12 patients. The sequences had >99% nucleotide identity to 85 reference sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes; phylogenetic tree analysis identified a few distinct subgroups (Figure S2) which were not divergent from each other, indicating that the outbreak may still be in an early stage."

            "We describe the first 12 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the United States, including clinical course of the first 7 hospitalized patients. Nine patients had traveled to Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak, one had traveled to China but not to Hubei Province, and two had close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19 in the United States, representing domestic human-to-human transmission. Illness ranged from mild to moderately severe, and hospitalized patients showed signs of clinical worsening in the second week. All patients recovered or are improving, and three patients tolerated treatment with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in upper and lower respiratory specimens, stool, and serum. The highest viral RNA levels were detected in upper respiratory tract specimens, typically during the first week of illness. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from the initial respiratory specimens of mild and moderately ill patients. Viral RNA was still detected after reported symptom resolution for seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis from these 12 patients\u2019 respiratory tract specimens support a single recent zoonotic transmission event in Wuhan City and subsequent human-to-human transmission.<br/><br/>Overall, these patients had milder disease than those in initial reports from China describing higher rates of complications and death.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] Initial case identification in China focused on hospitalized patients with pneumonia, but recent reports have described a milder clinical course, consistent with our findings.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Among hospitalized patients in this report, the second week of illness was characterized by clinical or laboratory signs of worsening such as hypoxemia, increase in fever, or elevation of aminotransferases. Although some patients received empiric antibiotic treatment for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia, no definitive evidence of bacterial co-infection was found.

        "INTRODUCTION": [
            "In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel disease COVID-19 caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China. As of March 4, 2020, more than 93,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported in 73 countries,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] and 80 confirmed and presumptive patients with COVID-19 have been identified in the United States;[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] one has been previously described in detail.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]",
            "SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, and the relationship to the clinical course of COVID-19 are not fully understood. We report the epidemiology, clinical course, clinical management, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed in the United States."
        ],
        "METHODS": [
            "Local health departments in consultation with clinicians identified patients under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 beginning January 17, 2020. PUI testing criteria changed during this period but included the presence of fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) and at least one epidemiologic risk factor in the two weeks before symptom onset. During January 17\u201331, epidemiologic risk factors were history of travel from Wuhan City, close contact with an ill PUI, or close contact with a patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.4,5 Beginning February 1, epidemiologic risk factors changed to close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19 or history of travel from mainland China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] During both time periods, close contact was defined as being within 6 feet for a prolonged period of time[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] or contact with respiratory secretions.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Specimens from PUIs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
            "Upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal [NP], oropharyngeal [OP]) and available lower respiratory tract specimens (sputum) were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] A case of COVID-19 was defined as identification of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in \u22651 specimen from a patient. We included patients with COVID-19 who were confirmed by CDC during January 20\u2013February 5, 2020.",
            "Patients with COVID-19 were interviewed by public health officials to collect information on demographics, exposures, travel history, and symptoms, including signs or symptoms before presentation. For all twelve patients, available medical records were reviewed. For hospitalized patients, clinicians systematically abstracted clinical data from the medical record.",
            "Illness day 1 was defined as the first day of reported COVID-19 signs and symptoms; collection date of the first SARS-CoV-2-positive specimen was used for one patient with no clear symptom onset date. When symptoms at onset or onset dates in the medical record differed from those reported from the public health interview, the latter were used. Results for virologic tests were reported relative to illness day 1. Duration of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was defined as dates of travel to China or dates of first to last exposure to a U.S patient with COVID-19. Fever was defined as subjective fever or temperature \u2265100.4 \u00b0F.",
            "We requested collection of NP swabs, OP swabs, sputum (if available), serum, urine, and stool from each patient initially for every 2\u20133 days for the first 17 days of illness for SARS-CoV-2 virologic testing.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]",
            "Further specimens were collected for testing if the patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 beyond day 17.",
            "CDC\u2019s Human Research Protection Office determined this work was exempt from human subjects\u2019 research regulations as it involved identification, control, or prevention of disease in response to an immediate public health threat. Forms used in this response were approved under OMB, number 09201011. Data were analyzed and visualized using Excel, SAS 9.4, R 3.6.2, and Python 3.7.3.10\u201313"
        ],
        "Laboratory Methods": [
            "Specimens were evaluated using SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, whole genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Virus culture was attempted from early SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory specimens (NP swabs, OP swabs, and sputum) from 9 patients. Further virus culture is ongoing. Detailed methods are included in the Appendix."
        ],
        "RESULTS": [
            "Twelve patients with confirmed COVID-19 were identified in six states. Five patients received only outpatient care and were isolated at home (Patients 1\u20135), and seven were hospitalized (Patients 6\u201312) (Figure 1). Median patient age was 53 years (range: 21\u201368); eight patients were male (Table 1). Four of five patients with \u22651 underlying medical conditions were hospitalized (Tables 1 and 2).",
            "Dates of illness onset ranged from January 14 through 29. Ten patients traveled to mainland China in the two weeks before illness onset, including nine to Wuhan City. Two patients\u2019 only reported exposure was close contact with a previously identified U.S patient with COVID-19. Among all patients, the duration of potential exposure ranged from 5 days to over 1 month; the time between last date of possible exposure and illness onset ranged from 0\u20135 days.",
            "The most commonly reported signs or symptoms at illness onset were cough (n=8) and subjective or measured fever (n=7) (Table 1). Two patients reported neither fever nor cough at onset, though they did develop them subsequently: one reported diarrhea as the initial symptom (one day before fever and cough), and the other reported sore throat.",
            "Over the course of illness, patients reported cough (n=12), subjective or measured fever (n=9), diarrhea (n=3), and vomiting (n=2). Three patients who did not report fever were never hospitalized and remained on home isolation. Of these, one patient reported only cough and rhinorrhea; one patient reported only cough which began before travel to China and did not change from the initial onset until resolution; and one patient reported cough, chills, fatigue, headache, and nausea.",
            "The clinical course for each hospitalized patient is described in the Appendix. The median duration of fever was 9 days (range: 2\u201311). Peak body temperature during hospitalization occurred at a median of illness day 9 (range: 4\u201310) (Figure 2). All hospitalized patients had oxygen saturation <94% on room air at some point during their illness, with the oxygen saturation nadir (range: 86\u201393%) occurring at a median of illness day 12 (range: 4\u201323) (Figure 2). Five patients reported difficulty breathing, and four received supplemental oxygen (Table 2; Figure 1). Patient 9 required high-flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation and intensive care monitoring.",
            "Two patients received a short course (\u22643 days) of corticosteroids. Three, including one who also received corticosteroids, received the investigational antiviral remdesivir (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California) under expanded access (compassionate use) for a duration of 4\u201310 days. Following remdesivir initiation, all had transient gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, gastroparesis, or rectal bleeding. No other post-remdesivir symptoms were observed. Patient 9 reported loose stool and rectal bleeding and had traveled in Mexico before illness onset; stool later tested positive for Giardia and Clostridiodes difficile. Remdesivir was discontinued after improvement in each patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms.",
            "Blood cultures were negative in 6/6 hospitalized patients tested, including those obtained from four patients treated empirically for bacterial pneumonia. Molecular testing for influenza A and B on respiratory specimens was negative, and multi-pathogen respiratory PCR panels were negative for all targets in all hospitalized patients (Table 2).",
            "Six of seven hospitalized patients had leukopenia (<4000 cells/\u03bcl), and the white blood cell count nadir occurred at a median of illness day 9 (range: 4\u201315) (Figure 1). Procalcitonin levels were <0.15 ng/ml in five of six patients who had levels checked. Aminotransferase levels were elevated in all hospitalized patients: AST levels peaked (median peak value 129 U/L, range 46\u2013190 U/L) at a median of illness day 13 (range 7\u201319) and ALT levels peaked (median peak value 136 U/L, range 66\u2013389 U/L) at a median of illness day 14 (range: 6\u201323). Three of seven hospitalized patients had mild elevations in alkaline phosphatase levels >115 U/L (maximum value 163 U/L). Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels >600 U/L, coinciding with clinical deterioration, were observed in two patients tested. No major elevations in serum total bilirubin (7 patients tested) or prolongations in prothrombin time (4 patients tested) were identified. Among the three remdesivir recipients, aminotransferase elevation developed in Patient 6 one day after starting remdesivir and in Patient 8 four days after starting remdesivir. Patient 9 had aminotransferase elevation at illness days 6\u20137 before starting remdesivir; aminotransferase levels started to decrease but increased again five days after starting remdesivir.",
            "Unilateral or bilateral pulmonary opacities were seen on chest imaging at some point for all seven hospitalized patients (Table 2). Four hospitalized patients did not have any abnormalities identified on initial chest radiograph (illness day range: 4\u20139). Patient 7 had an abnormal chest computed tomography scan on the day of the normal chest radiograph (day 7).",
            "All 12 patients had respiratory specimens collected between illness days 1\u20139 (median, day 4), and all tested positive in \u22652 specimen types (Figure 3). Among initial diagnostic specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in OP (11/11 patients), NP (10/12 patients), and sputum (4/4 patients). Viable SARS-CoV-2 virus was cultured from 5/6 initial NP specimens, 4/7 initial OP specimens, 3/3 initial sputum specimens, and 1/1 additional sputum specimen collected 3 days after the initial specimens (Figure 3). Virus was cultured from two patients who were not hospitalized (Figure 3).",
            "As of February 22, 398 specimens were collected and tested from the 12 patients throughout the course of illness. All 12 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in at least one NP swab, 11/12 in an OP swab, 6/6 in sputum, 1/12 in serum, 7/10 in stool, and 0/10 in urine (Figure 3). Among 98 pairs of simultaneous NP and OP specimens, 58 (59%) had concordant results. Among 27 discordant pairs with one positive specimen, the NP specimen was positive in 70%; the remaining 13 discordant pairs had one negative and one inconclusive specimen. Two patients provided sputum specimens when NP and/or OP specimens tested negative, and sputum continued to be positive in both patients. In Patient 7, viral RNA was detected in sputum 17 days after the last positive OP specimen and \u22652 weeks after reported symptom resolution. In seven patients who had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in stool, most detections occurred when viral RNA was still detectable in the respiratory tract. Among three patients who reported diarrhea, all had viral RNA detected in stool.",
            "Mean Ct values in positive specimens were 17.0\u201339.0 for NP, 22.1\u201339.7 for OP, and 24.1\u201339.4 for stool. Ct values were lower in the first week of illness than the second in most patients (Figure S1); in some patients, low Ct values continued into the 2nd and 3rd week of illness. There was no apparent relationship between Ct values in the upper respiratory tract and disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR results turned positive in serum of Patient 9 in the second week of illness at the time of rapid clinical deterioration.",
            "Serial testing to determine duration of RNA detection and viral shedding is ongoing. As of February 22, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected at a maximum of day 26 in NP specimens, day 26 in OP, day 29 in sputum, and day 25 in stool (Figure 3). The duration of viral RNA detection did not differ by hospitalization status or supplemental oxygen requirement.",
            "As of February 22, all patients reported symptom resolution (Figure 1). Eleven patients reported cough, (often intermittent) as the last symptom. Median symptom duration was 14 days (range: 6\u201320). SARSCoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in 7/11 patients, including in NP (n=6), OP (n=2), sputum (n=1), and stool (n=3) specimens. As of February 22, one patient remained hospitalized, and five patients remained on home isolation. Home isolation was discontinued for 6 patients per CDC criteria;[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] the last respiratory specimens with a positive or inconclusive test result were collected from these patients on days 12\u201329.",
            "Complete genome sequences were generated from respiratory specimens from all 12 patients. The sequences had >99% nucleotide identity to 85 reference sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes; phylogenetic tree analysis identified a few distinct subgroups (Figure S2) which were not divergent from each other, indicating that the outbreak may still be in an early stage."
        ],
        "DISCUSSION": [
            "We describe the first 12 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the United States, including clinical course of the first 7 hospitalized patients. Nine patients had traveled to Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak, one had traveled to China but not to Hubei Province, and two had close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19 in the United States, representing domestic human-to-human transmission. Illness ranged from mild to moderately severe, and hospitalized patients showed signs of clinical worsening in the second week. All patients recovered or are improving, and three patients tolerated treatment with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in upper and lower respiratory specimens, stool, and serum. The highest viral RNA levels were detected in upper respiratory tract specimens, typically during the first week of illness. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from the initial respiratory specimens of mild and moderately ill patients. Viral RNA was still detected after reported symptom resolution for seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis from these 12 patients\u2019 respiratory tract specimens support a single recent zoonotic transmission event in Wuhan City and subsequent human-to-human transmission.",
            "Overall, these patients had milder disease than those in initial reports from China describing higher rates of complications and death.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] Initial case identification in China focused on hospitalized patients with pneumonia, but recent reports have described a milder clinical course, consistent with our findings.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Among hospitalized patients in this report, the second week of illness was characterized by clinical or laboratory signs of worsening such as hypoxemia, increase in fever, or elevation of aminotransferases. Although some patients received empiric antibiotic treatment for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia, no definitive evidence of bacterial co-infection was found. Worsening in the second week of illness is consistent with previous reports[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] and highlights the importance of close monitoring beyond the first week of illness, even in patients with mild illness or no initial radiographic abnormalities.",
            "Patient 9, the most severely ill among this series, experienced sudden clinical deterioration late in the second week of illness. This was the only patient with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in serum, and detection in serum was temporally related to clinical deterioration. Similar observations have been described previously.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] Increased proinflammatory cytokines have been observed in patients with COVID-19,17 and it is possible that cytokine dysregulation and endothelial dysfunction contribute to both clinical worsening and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum.",
