        "abstract": "Clinical assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 respiratory illness, has been a major activity of infectious diseases services in the UK and elsewhere since the first report of cases in December 2019. We report our case series of 68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.\nFinal microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir.\nThe majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of more unwell patients.",

            "SARS-CoV-2 is a recently named novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of respiratory disease named COVID-19, arising in Wuhan, China, in December 20191-3. At the time of writing (27th Feb 2020) the overwhelming majority of cases have been reported from inside China, however single or small numbers of cases have been confirmed in 46 other countries.

            "Clinical assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 respiratory illness, has been a major activity of infectious diseases services in the UK and elsewhere since the first report of cases in December 2019. We report our case series of 68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.",
            "Final microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir.",
            "The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of more unwell patients."

            "SARS-CoV-2 is a recently named novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of respiratory disease named COVID-19, arising in Wuhan, China, in December 20191-3. At the time of writing (27th Feb 2020) the overwhelming majority of cases have been reported from inside China, however single or small numbers of cases have been confirmed in 46 other countries. Transmission has occurred in some countries outside China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], including the UK6.",

As of 27/02/2020, 7690 tests have been performed nationally, of which 15 were positive (0.2%). Initially, testing has been led by clinicians, predominantly by infectious diseases or emergency department physicians, although there are plans to move to a community testing model led by other groups of healthcare professionals, and some regions have already done so. Patients are instructed to selfisolate while results are pending and until their symptoms have resolved, with possible financial and health implications for the 99.8% so far in the UK who have an illness other than COVID-19. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic when a syndromic management strategy with presumptive treatment and self-isolation was used, initial clinical diagnoses of influenza were reported to delay diagnoses of a number of diseases including primary HIV infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] and Plasmodium falciparum malaria[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], and although scoring systems were developed it remains difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial pneumonia on clinical grounds[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].

            "Here we describe our experience of the first 68 patients we have tested for SARS-CoV-2 at a Regional Infectious Diseases unit (RIDU) in the UK. We present the spectrum of illness, alternative diagnoses made and management provided. This is of particular interest at this stage of the epidemic, where many individuals meeting the definition of a suspected case are returning travellers, where the differential diagnosis of respiratory or undifferentiated febrile illness may be broad[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].

If more generalised outbreaks occur outside China, we may start to see severe COVID-19 presenting to UK healthcare services.",
            "Specialist Infectious Diseases consultant-delivered assessment of a group of patients who predominantly have mild illness is unlikely to be sustainable, especially as the case-definition broadens to include a wider geographical area and/or COVID-19 patients requiring inpatient care becomes more common in the UK. There was a step-change in the number of suspected cases seen after the introduction of the third case definition on the evening of 6th February 2020 as a high number of people with respiratory symptoms and recent travel suddenly became suspected of having COVID-19. As there is further spread in the coming weeks, as is the case in Italy and Iran, and the epidemiological criteria of the case definition is notably extended again, Infectious Diseases clinicians will be unable to sustain a hospital-based screening service. The NHS is responding to this challenge by moving to a community provider screening model, which will deliver the majority of testing in the home.",
            "Specialist input and assessment, supported by appropriate laboratory investigations must be easily accessible to a COVID-19 testing service, especially if delivered by health care workers other than Infectious Diseases physicians. This is important for patients in the self-isolation periods both before and after receiving a test result as these individuals will not readily be able to access the usual healthcare services. This may apply particularly to patients with pre-existing lung disease, where respiratory viral illness, caused by SARS-CoV-2 or otherwise, may trigger clinical deterioration that could ordinarily be managed by early community intervention. Infectious Diseases physicians may be the group best placed to support patients in this situation for the short period of self-isolation,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] especially given the need for ongoing personal protective equipment use[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Although we did not observe any imported \u201ctropical\u201d infections such as dengue, malaria, typhoid, rickettsiosis or leptospirosis, these remain important differential diagnoses in returning travellers from some areas of South East Asia and may be life-threatening if missed[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. These diagnoses may become more common in this group now that the definition of a suspected case has been expanded to include other countries in South or South East Asia such as Vietnam. Individuals receiving testing for COVID19 should be signposted to an accessible clinical service with an understanding of this differential diagnosis in case of worsening illness.",
            "Our data from the routine virological testing performed is in keeping with community based results showing that symptoms and viral detection do not always go together[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] and shows a different spectrum to those patients admitted and tested using the same assay[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], with fewer influenza diagnoses and a greater proportion of rhinovirus / enterovirus as well as seasonal coronaviruses cases. A recent report from Italy[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], immediately before the recent increase in SARS-CoV-2 detection showed a greater proportion of influenza B than in our cohort, which may be explainable by the differing geographical exposures between the two groups.",
            "Admitting individuals to a secondary care facility, even for short periods of assessment, may have other drawbacks. Travellers to South East Asia, particularly those who received antibiotics or were admitted to healthcare facilities, can potentially carry and transmit carbapenem-producing enterobacteriaceae. Additionally, because these patients need to be more pragmatically managed than patients not suspected of COVID-19, they may be more likely to be exposed to antimicrobial therapy. There are also significant resource implications not just in terms of PPE use but predominantly in terms of the time required to don and doff PPE for every care interaction from bringing food to routine observations to clinical review. This burden can be at least partially alleviated through a home testing approach.",
            "Infection clinician time is another important resource that may not be best used in managing mild respiratory illness that meets the suspected COVID-19 case definition. In recent years, many studies have demonstrated the benefit of ID physician review in terms of clinical outcome and resource utilisation in infections such as Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] and resistant gram-negative infections[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Our findings support the assessment of, and testing for, possible COVID-19 by other cadres of healthcare workers, outside the secondary care setting, but supported by specialist physicians and hospital based further diagnostics where needed. The optimum configuration for such a service remains unclear and is likely to vary depending on local constraints, but during the containment phase of the epidemic response there may be time to pilot and compare a range of models before we are forced to move to delay and possibly mitigation strategies."
