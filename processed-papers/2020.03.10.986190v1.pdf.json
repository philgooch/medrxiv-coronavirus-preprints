        "abstract": "The rigidity and flexibility of two recently reported crystal structures (PDB entries 6Y2E and 6LU7) of a protease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infectious agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, has been investigated using pebble-game rigidity analysis, elastic network model normal mode analysis, and all-atom geometric simulations. This computational investigation of the viral protease follows protocols that have been effective in studying other homodimeric enzymes. The protease is predicted to display flexible motions in vivo which directly affect the geometry of a known inhibitor binding site and which open new potential binding sites elsewhere in the structure. A database of generated PDB files representing natural flexible variations on the crystal structures has been produced and made available for download from an institutional data archive. This information may inform structure-based drug design and fragment screening efforts aimed at identifying specific antiviral therapies for the treatment of COVID-19.",

            "As of late 2019, there has been global concern over a novel respiratory disease (designated COVID-19 by the World Health Organisation (WHO)) which originated in the Wuhan region of China and has subsequently spread to multiple other countries worldwide. The virus causing COVID-19 is a coronavirus with the taxonomic identifier SARS-CoV-2[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Thanks to the diligent efforts of structural biologists, several crystal structures of proteins from SARS-CoV-2 have already been obtained and made available through the Protein Data Bank (PDB) even in advance of journal publication.<br/><br/>Crystal structures provide us with detailed structural knowledge of the arrangement of atoms making up a protein or protein complex. A crystal structure is a static snapshot of the protein \u201cfrozen\u201d into one of its many possible conformations. This static snapshot is rich in implicit information on the natural dynamics which the protein will explore in vivo. These natural dynamics, described by Kern[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] as a protein\u2019s \u201cdynamic personality\u201d, can be critical to a protein\u2019s function, and can directly affect the geometry of, for example, an enzyme active site.<br/><br/>A judicious combination of simplified methodologies \u2013 rigidity analysis, elastic network modelling, and geometric simulation of flexible motion \u2013 can work together to extract valuable information on the large-amplitude, low-frequency motions of a protein structure, at a fraction of the computational cost (in resources and time) of molecular dynamics (MD) approaches[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. These simplified methods are strongly complementary to both computational MD investigations and experimental biophysical/biochemical studies of protein behaviour.<br/><br/>Recent studies has established that the motions explored by geometric simulation correspond well to the essential dynamics extracted from MD trajectories[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]; that global flexible motions can couple to enzyme active site geometry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]; and, crucially, that a structure generated from geometric simulation of a large amplitude motion can be used as input for further MD investigation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], as the geometric simulation retains the local bonding geometry and constraint network of the input crystal structure and forbids major bonding distortions and steric clashes.<br/><br/>The information obtained here regarding the flexibility of the enzyme should be of use and interest in structure-based drug design and computational screening of drugs and drug-like molecules capable of binding to and inhibiting the action of the viral protease, such as the pioneering work of Walsh et al reported online within the past few days[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The simulations reported here suggest that the protease structure is capable of substantial flexible motions which alter domain orientations, open and close clefts, and affect the geometry of an inhibitor-binding site. The entirety of the computational work described here was carried out in less than one working day on a laptop computer. The inputs and outputs of the simulations, principally consisting of PDB files representing flexible variations on the protease crystal structures, are available for download from the University of Bath research data archive at https://researchdata.bath.ac.uk/772/ [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] with DOI https://doi.org/10.15125/BATH-00772"

            "<strong>Results and discussion</strong><br/><br/>The 6Y2E and 6LU7 crystal structures each contain explicit coordinates for one chain (A) of the protease, and in the case of 6LU7, a chain (C) representing a bound inhibitor. The input structures for analysis and simulation consist of chain A and a symmetry copy (B), making up the biological homodimer. Chain C is likewise duplicated to chain D. The X-ray structure does not contain explicit hydrogens, which are added using MolProbity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. With hydrogens added, it is then possible to detect the covalent bonds, polar noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonds and salt bridges) and hydrophobictether interactions using SBFIRST[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] (see Methods). The polar interactions are rated with an effective energy between 0 and -10 kcal/mol based on the donor-hydrogen-acceptor geometry.<br/><br/>Pebble-game rigidity analysis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] divides the structure into rigid clusters and flexible regions based on the distribution of degrees of freedom and constraints. This rigid cluster decomposition (RCD) depends on the set of polar interactions that are included, based on an energy cutoff that excludes weaker interactions. Information on the relative stability of different portions of the structure is typically obtained at cutoffs around a \u201croom temperature\u201d value of -1 kcal/mol. RCDs are shown in Figure 1. With the inclusion of weaker polar constraints, a single large rigid cluster extends across both chains of the protease dimer. As weaker constraints are eliminated, the large cluster extends across the N-terminal domains (roughly residues 1-200) of both chains, which consist largely of beta-sheet structure, while the largely alpha-helical C-terminal domain breaks up into several smaller rigid clusters, each one a single helix. With further elimination of constraints, the beta-sheet regions become fully flexible.    -1.0 kcal/mol    -1.5 kcal/mol    -2.0 kcal/mol    -2.5 kcal/mol<br/><br/>Flexible motion of a protein structure is best carried out at with a rigidity cutoff such that the structure is fully flexible. The mobility studies that follow are carried out with a cutoff of -3.0 kcal/mol, similar to previous studies on enzymes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. It is important to appreciate that even at this lower cutoff the structure is still thoroughly constrained by noncovalent interactions, as illustrated in Figure 2. The core of each folded domain is rich in hydrophobic interactions, as is the interface region between the two beta-sheet domains as the two chains form the homodimer, and arrays of strong polar interactions constrain secondary structure (for example, the backbone hydrogen bonds within alpha helices and beta sheets).<br/><br/>Also highlighted in Figure 2 are a small set of hydrophobic interactions assigned between the N-terminal domains of chains A and B. In the 6Y2E structure, a single tether connects the sidechains of the ALA 285 residues of both chains. In the 6LU7 structure illustrated, there are two additional tethers nearby, each connecting the sidechains of the THR 280 residue of one chain and the LEU 286 of the other. Since the two N-terminal domains are otherwise not connected by noncovalent interactions, and these tethers are not involved in forming a rigid cluster, it seems reasonable to consider these tethers an artefact of crystal packing, and eliminate them from further consideration. Their deletion does not affect the rigid cluster decompositions of the structures. If these tethers were retained, they would somewhat limit (but not entirely prevent) the central cleft-opening motion discussed below. Normal modes, representing directions of motion intrinsic to the structure, are easily obtained from an elastic network model[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] (see Methods) in which the protein is represented as one site per residue and springs of uniform strength are placed between every pair of sites with a separation less than 10 \u00c5. In the 6LU7 structure, the amino acid residues of the bound inhibitor are included in the elastic network. Of the 3N normal modes of a structure with N residues, six modes of near-zero frequency represent the trivial rigid body motions of the structure, while the low-frequency modes from 7 upwards represent modes of flexible motion. When the structure moves along a low-frequency mode direction, the global geometry changes with minimal change in the local geometry, making these directions of \u201ceasy\u201d motion for the protein. The sign of a normal mode eigenvector is arbitrary; motions parallel and antiparallel to each bias direction must be investigated equally.<br/><br/>Linear projection of a protein structure along a normal mode direction would rapidly introduce unphysical distortions into the structure. The geometric simulation approach implemented in FRODA[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] instead applies a bias, moving the structure along a normal mode direction, while maintaining steric exclusion and the bonding geometry and noncovalent constraints of the input structure. This approach rapidly generates physically realistic flexible variations on the input structure which retain all-atom steric and bonding detail.<br/><br/>Geometric simulations of the lowest-frequency nontrivial modes of motion (7 upwards) show that the protease structure is capable of substantial amplitudes of easy motion covering several \u00c5ngstroms distance in global root-mean-square displacement (RMSD). In particular, the orientations of the alphahelical domains relative to the beta-sheet domains can change through flexing and rotation about the interdomain \u201chinges\u201d, and the beta-sheet domains themselves are large enough to display bending and twisting motions within themselves. These variations are illustrated for the 6Y2E structure in Figure 3 and for 6LU7 in Figure 4.    7+    8+    9+    12+    11+    10+<br/><br/>Flexible variations on a protein crystal structure are potentially relevant to structure-based drug design in at least two ways. Firstly, flexible motion can open or expose clefts and potential binding sites not directly visible in the static crystal structure. Since the protein in vivo will be exploring its flexible motion thanks to the Brownian-motion driving force of its solvent (e.g. cytosol), such latent sites may constitute valid target areas for inhibitors.<br/><br/>Secondly, the global low-frequency motion couples to variations in the binding site/active site geometry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Knowledge of the range of flexible variation here is potentially useful for structurebased drug design and/or fragment screening, since attention can be focussed on candidate molecules that interact robustly with the binding site and tolerate its flexibility, in preference to molecules that interact well only with the crystal structure and not with its flexible variations.<br/><br/>Figure 5 illustrates a case of cleft opening. In both the 6Y2E and 6LU7 structures, some of the modes of motion (9- and 11+ in 6Y2E; 8+ and 11+ in 6LU7) have the two alpha-helical domains moving apart from each other, exposing a cleft at the centre of the protein that is a largely covered, narrow tunnel in the crystal structures. If the hydrophobic tethers eliminated previously were retained, the amplitude of this opening motion would be limited, but the cleft opening could still occur in the form of a widening of the tunnel. The protein structures are in this case shown in a space-filling (sphere) representation, since it is the exposure of new surface that is of interest.<br/><br/>a b c d e f purple, amidic; blue, basic.<br/><br/>A more detailed view of this opening cleft is shown in Figure 6. The residues are coloured to bring out the chemical character of the amino acid side chains. The portions of the alpha-helical domain surfaces that move aside to open the cleft display largely hydrophobic residues (aliphatic or aromatic side chains). Intriguingly, the exposed surface area within the cleft is richly lined with a series of basic residues (lysine and arginine), and is flanked by acidic (aspartic and glutamic acids) and polar (threonine) residues. In the crystal structures the basic and acidic residues appear to be involved in a network of inter- and intra-domain salt bridge interactions which stabilise the core of the homodimer. An antagonist capable of targeting this zone of strongly polar surface geometry exposed by flexible motion could potentially disrupt the dynamics of the enzyme and interfere with its function.<br/><br/>In the 6LU7 structure, a binding site on the flank of each beta-sheet domain is occupied by the inhibitor N-((5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl)alanyl-L-valyl-N~1~-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-(((3R)-2oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)methyl)but-2-enyl)-L-leucinamide (chain C of the structure), hereinafter \u201cN3\u201d. This inhibitor is listed in the PDB as PRD_002214; it is a peptide-like inhibitor, with a central core of amino acids modified at either end with heterogroups, and was previously known to inhibit a protease of a feline coronavirus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] (see PDB entry 5EU8). In the 6Y2E structure the same binding cleft is empty, which means that its geometry is likely to change in the course of flexible motion of the beta-sheet domain. Figure 7 shows the N3 binding site of the 6LU7 structure and the corresponding region of the 6Y2E structure. As noted, all structures have been aligned to the 6Y2E crystal structure for ease of viewing and comparison. Figure 7 also shows flexible variations of the 6Y2E site in the course of flexible motion. A set of residues forming a rough square around the binding site (GLU 166, GLN 189, ASN 142 and THR 25) are highlighted in white as a guide to the eye. It is immediately visible that openings, closings and flexible distortions of the site are an intrinsic feature of the flexible motion of the protease. Note in particular the effect of motion along the lowest-frequency nontrivial mode direction, mode 7. Motion biased antiparallel to the mode eigenvector (7-) includes an opening of the cleft, while motion biased parallel to it (7+) closes it. Since the N3 inhibitor is quite deeply embedded in the binding site of the 6LU7 structure, opening and closing of this cleft in the course of the protein\u2019s natural motion may be necessary for molecules to access the cleft. On visual inspection, the site in the 6Y2E structure is clearly slightly more closed that in 6LU7, consistent with the proposition that such opening/closing motions are intrinsic to the protein."

Normal modes, representing directions of motion intrinsic to the structure, are easily obtained from an elastic network model[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] (see Methods) in which the protein is represented as one site per residue and springs of uniform strength are placed between every pair of sites with a separation less than 10 \u00c5. In the 6LU7 structure, the amino acid residues of the bound inhibitor are included in the elastic network. Of the 3N normal modes of a structure with N residues, six modes of near-zero frequency represent the trivial rigid body motions of the structure, while the low-frequency modes from 7 upwards represent modes of flexible motion. When the structure moves along a low-frequency mode direction, the global geometry changes with minimal change in the local geometry, making these directions of \u201ceasy\u201d motion for the protein. The sign of a normal mode eigenvector is arbitrary; motions parallel and antiparallel to each bias direction must be investigated equally.",
            "Linear projection of a protein structure along a normal mode direction would rapidly introduce unphysical distortions into the structure. The geometric simulation approach implemented in FRODA[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] instead applies a bias, moving the structure along a normal mode direction, while maintaining steric exclusion and the bonding geometry and noncovalent constraints of the input structure. This approach rapidly generates physically realistic flexible variations on the input structure which retain all-atom steric and bonding detail.",
            "Geometric simulations of the lowest-frequency nontrivial modes of motion (7 upwards) show that the protease structure is capable of substantial amplitudes of easy motion covering several \u00c5ngstroms distance in global root-mean-square displacement (RMSD). In particular, the orientations of the alphahelical domains relative to the beta-sheet domains can change through flexing and rotation about the interdomain \u201chinges\u201d, and the beta-sheet domains themselves are large enough to display bending and twisting motions within themselves. These variations are illustrated for the 6Y2E structure in Figure 3 and for 6LU7 in Figure 4.",
            "Flexible variations on a protein crystal structure are potentially relevant to structure-based drug design in at least two ways. Firstly, flexible motion can open or expose clefts and potential binding sites not directly visible in the static crystal structure. Since the protein in vivo will be exploring its flexible motion thanks to the Brownian-motion driving force of its solvent (e.g. cytosol), such latent sites may constitute valid target areas for inhibitors.",
            "Secondly, the global low-frequency motion couples to variations in the binding site/active site geometry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Knowledge of the range of flexible variation here is potentially useful for structurebased drug design and/or fragment screening, since attention can be focussed on candidate molecules that interact robustly with the binding site and tolerate its flexibility, in preference to molecules that interact well only with the crystal structure and not with its flexible variations.",
            "Figure 5 illustrates a case of cleft opening. In both the 6Y2E and 6LU7 structures, some of the modes of motion (9- and 11+ in 6Y2E; 8+ and 11+ in 6LU7) have the two alpha-helical domains moving apart from each other, exposing a cleft at the centre of the protein that is a largely covered, narrow tunnel in the crystal structures. If the hydrophobic tethers eliminated previously were retained, the amplitude of this opening motion would be limited, but the cleft opening could still occur in the form of a widening of the tunnel. The protein structures are in this case shown in a space-filling (sphere) representation, since it is the exposure of new surface that is of interest.",
            "A more detailed view of this opening cleft is shown in Figure 6. The residues are coloured to bring out the chemical character of the amino acid side chains. The portions of the alpha-helical domain surfaces that move aside to open the cleft display largely hydrophobic residues (aliphatic or aromatic side chains). Intriguingly, the exposed surface area within the cleft is richly lined with a series of basic residues (lysine and arginine), and is flanked by acidic (aspartic and glutamic acids) and polar (threonine) residues. In the crystal structures the basic and acidic residues appear to be involved in a network of inter- and intra-domain salt bridge interactions which stabilise the core of the homodimer. An antagonist capable of targeting this zone of strongly polar surface geometry exposed by flexible motion could potentially disrupt the dynamics of the enzyme and interfere with its function.",
            "In the 6LU7 structure, a binding site on the flank of each beta-sheet domain is occupied by the inhibitor N-((5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl)alanyl-L-valyl-N~1~-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-(((3R)-2oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)methyl)but-2-enyl)-L-leucinamide (chain C of the structure), hereinafter \u201cN3\u201d. This inhibitor is listed in the PDB as PRD_002214; it is a peptide-like inhibitor, with a central core of amino acids modified at either end with heterogroups, and was previously known to inhibit a protease of a feline coronavirus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] (see PDB entry 5EU8). In the 6Y2E structure the same binding cleft is empty, which means that its geometry is likely to change in the course of flexible motion of the beta-sheet domain. Figure 7 shows the N3 binding site of the 6LU7 structure and the corresponding region of the 6Y2E structure. As noted, all structures have been aligned to the 6Y2E crystal structure for ease of viewing and comparison. Figure 7 also shows flexible variations of the 6Y2E site in the course of flexible motion. A set of residues forming a rough square around the binding site (GLU 166, GLN 189, ASN 142 and THR 25) are highlighted in white as a guide to the eye. It is immediately visible that openings, closings and flexible distortions of the site are an intrinsic feature of the flexible motion of the protease. Note in particular the effect of motion along the lowest-frequency nontrivial mode direction, mode 7. Motion biased antiparallel to the mode eigenvector (7-) includes an opening of the cleft, while motion biased parallel to it (7+) closes it. Since the N3 inhibitor is quite deeply embedded in the binding site of the 6LU7 structure, opening and closing of this cleft in the course of the protein\u2019s natural motion may be necessary for molecules to access the cleft. On visual inspection, the site in the 6Y2E structure is clearly slightly more closed that in 6LU7, consistent with the proposition that such opening/closing motions are intrinsic to the protein."

        "Conclusions": [
            "The rigidity and flexibility of two recently reported crystal structures (PDB entries 6Y2E and 6LU7) of a protease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infectious agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, has been investigated using pebble-game rigidity analysis, elastic network model normal mode analysis, and all-atom geometric simulations. This computational investigation of the viral protease follows protocols that have been effective in studying other homodimeric enzymes. The protease is predicted to display flexible motions in vivo which directly affect the geometry of a known inhibitor binding site, e.g. through an opening/closing motion, and which open new potential binding sites elsewhere in the structure. A database of generated PDB files representing natural flexible variations on the crystal structures has been produced and made available for download from an institutional data archive. This information may inform structure-based drug design and fragment screening efforts aimed at identifying specific antiviral therapies for the treatment of COVID-19."

        "Highlighted in Figure 2 are a small set of hydrophobic interactions assigned between the N-terminal domains of chains A and B",
        "Since the two N-terminal domains are otherwise not connected by noncovalent interactions, and these tethers are not involved in forming a rigid cluster, it seems reasonable to consider these tethers an artefact of crystal packing, and eliminate them from further consideration",
        "Normal modes, representing directions of motion intrinsic to the structure, are obtained from an elastic network model[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] in which the protein is represented as one site per residue and springs of uniform strength are placed between every pair of sites with a separation less than 10 \u00c5",
        "In the 6LU7 structure, the amino acid residues of the bound inhibitor are included in the elastic network",
        "When the structure moves along a low-frequency mode direction, the global geometry changes with minimal change in the local geometry, making these directions of \u201ceasy\u201d motion for the protein",
        "The geometric simulation approach implemented in FRODA[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] instead applies a bias, moving the structure along a normal mode direction, while maintaining steric exclusion and the bonding geometry and noncovalent constraints of the input structure",
        "The orientations of the alphahelical domains relative to the beta-sheet domains can change through flexing and rotation about the interdomain \u201chinges\u201d, and the beta-sheet domains themselves are large enough to display bending and twisting motions within themselves",
        "These variations are illustrated for the 6Y2E structure in Figure 3 and for 6LU7 in Figure 4",
        "Flexible variations on a protein crystal structure are potentially relevant to structure-based drug design in at least two ways",
        "Knowledge of the range of flexible variation here is potentially useful for structurebased drug design and/or fragment screening, since attention can be focussed on candidate molecules that interact robustly with the binding site and tolerate its flexibility, in preference to molecules that interact well only with the crystal structure and not with its flexible variations",
        "The protein structures are in this case shown in a space-filling representation, since it is the exposure of new surface that is of interest",
        "The exposed surface area within the cleft is richly lined with a series of basic residues, and is flanked by acidic and polar residues",
        "In the crystal structures the basic and acidic residues appear to be involved in a network of inter- and intra-domain salt bridge interactions which stabilise the core of the homodimer",
        "An antagonist capable of targeting this zone of strongly polar surface geometry exposed by flexible motion could potentially disrupt the dynamics of the enzyme and interfere with its function",
        "In the 6LU7 structure, a binding site on the flank of each beta-sheet domain is occupied by the inhibitor N-((5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl)alanyl-L-valyl-N~1~-((1R,2Z)-4--4-oxo-1-(((3R)-2oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)methyl)but-2-enyl)-L-leucinamide, hereinafter \u201cN3\u201d. This inhibitor is listed in the Protein Data Bank as PRD_002214; it is a peptide-like inhibitor, with a central core of amino acids modified at either end with heterogroups, and was previously known to inhibit a protease of a feline coronavirus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]",
        "In the 6Y2E structure the same binding cleft is empty, which means that its geometry is likely to change in the course of flexible motion of the beta-sheet domain",
        "All structures have been aligned to the 6Y2E crystal structure for ease of viewing and comparison",
        "It is immediately visible that openings, closings and flexible distortions of the site are an intrinsic feature of the flexible motion of the protease",
        "Since the N3 inhibitor is quite deeply embedded in the binding site of the 6LU7 structure, opening and closing of this cleft in the course of the protein\u2019s natural motion may be necessary for molecules to access the cleft",
        "The site in the 6Y2E structure is clearly slightly more closed that in 6LU7, consistent with the proposition that such opening/closing motions are intrinsic to the protein",
        "The rigidity and flexibility of two recently reported crystal structures (PDB entries 6Y2E and 6LU7) of a protease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infectious agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, has been investigated using pebble-game rigidity analysis, elastic network model normal mode analysis, and all-atom geometric simulations. This computational investigation of the viral protease follows protocols that have been effective in studying other homodimeric enzymes",
        "The protease is predicted to display flexible motions in vivo which directly affect the geometry of a known inhibitor binding site, e.g. through an opening/closing motion, and which open new potential binding sites elsewhere in the structure",
        "A database of generated Protein Data Bank files representing natural flexible variations on the crystal structures has been produced and made available for download from an institutional data archive. This information may inform structure-based drug design and fragment screening efforts aimed at identifying specific antiviral therapies for the treatment of COVID-19"
