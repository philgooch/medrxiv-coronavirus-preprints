            "In this retrospective, outside-China diagnosis number reported from Jan 21 to Feb 28, 2020 was downloaded from WHO website. We develop a simple regression model on these numbers:<br/><br/>!\"( # + 34) = 0 \u00b7 0515 \u00d7   + 2 \u00b7 075 where Nt is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, t=1 at Feb 1.",

The data in this analysis starts from Jan 21 and currently it ends at Feb 28.<br/><br/>Model We first explored the data by plotting log transformed daily number. We observed a good linear trend recently, but a relatively poor fit at the beginning of spread. We therefore consider that there are some unobserved founder patients at the beginning. Based on exploratory data analysis and mathematical intuition we proposed the following model: where Nt is the number of diagnosed patients outside China according to WHO at the tth day, t=1 at Feb 1; u is the number of unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China; a and b are simple linear regression parameters. We enumerated u from 0 to 100 with step size 1. For each u, we calculated Pearson\u2019s correlation R2 between t and  !\"( # +  ) . We selected the  7  that maximize R2 and estimate corresponding  7  and  8  using a simple linear regression between t and  !\"( # +  7 )."

            "Based on this model, we estimate that there have been about 34 unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China. The global trend is approximately exponential, with the rate of 10 folds every 19 days.<br/><br/>Research in context Evidence before this study In December 2019, pneumonia infected with a novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China. Now the situation is almost controlled in China but is worse outside China. Now there are 4,691 patients across 51 countries and territories outside China. We searched PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for articles published up to Feb 28, 2020, using the keywords \u201cCOVID\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d or \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d. No published work about the global trend of epidemics outside China could be identified. Added value of this study We built a simple \u201clog-plus\u201d linear model to capture the global trend of epidemics outside China. We estimate that there have been about 34 unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China. The global trend is approximately exponential, with the rate of 10 folds every 19 days. Implications of all the available evidence With the limited number of data points and the complexity of the real situation, a straightforward model is expected to work better. Our model suggests that the COVID-19 disease follows an approximate exponential growth model stably at the very beginning. We predict that the number of confirmed patients outside China will increase ten folds in every 19 days without strong intervention by applying our model. Powerful actions on public health should be taken to combat this epidemic all over the world."

            "In early December of 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] A novel coronavirus (now named as COVID-19) was verified and identified as the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus (subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily) through high-throughput sequencing.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Human-to-human transmission in hospital and family settings had been accumulating 5-7 and has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019 based on evidence from early transmission dynamics.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] According to WHO statistics, the accumulating number of diagnosed patients in China was 78,961 in Feb 28, 2020.9<br/><br/>COVID-19 raised intension not only within China but internationally. Since the first case of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 was reported from Wuhan, COVID-19 patients had rapidly been diagnosed in other cities of China and the neighboring countries including Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and even to a few Western countries.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] On January13 2020, the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand reported the first imported case of lab-confirmed novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 13 As of Feb28 2020, cases had been reported in 52 countries and territories. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases had reached 4,691 outside China, 9 and the number is still increasing. South Korea, the worst affected country outside China, has reported another jump. The 571 new cases brought South Korea\u2019s total confirmed cases to 2,337. A surge in cases of COVID-19 in Italy, Japan and Iran also heightened fears that the world is on the brink of a pandemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] In Feb 28, WHO increased the assessment of the risk of spread and risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at the global level.<br/><br/>Recently, many researchers devoted to more details about the analysis of the spread of epidemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] Some paralleled results have shown that the reproductive number R0 estimated of COVID-19 is bigger than that of SARS based on different models. 16-18 With the limited number of data points and the complexity of the real situation, a straightforward model is expected to work better (see Discussion). In this study, we propose a \u201clog-plus\u201d model for the situation prediction which only requires daily number of total diagnosis outside China. This model assumes that there were some unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China and exponential growth later. Despite the simplicity of our model, it fits the data well (R2=0.991). The prediction is expected to provide practical significance on social application and evidence for enhancing public health interventions to avoid severe outbreaks."

            "In early December of 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] A novel coronavirus (now named as COVID-19) was verified and identified as the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus (subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily) through high-throughput sequencing.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Human-to-human transmission in hospital and family settings had been accumulating 5-7 and has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019 based on evidence from early transmission dynamics.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] According to WHO statistics, the accumulating number of diagnosed patients in China was 78,961 in Feb 28, 2020.9",
            "COVID-19 raised intension not only within China but internationally. Since the first case of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 was reported from Wuhan, COVID-19 patients had rapidly been diagnosed in other cities of China and the neighboring countries including Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and even to a few Western countries.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] On January13 2020, the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand reported the first imported case of lab-confirmed novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 13 As of Feb28 2020, cases had been reported in 52 countries and territories. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases had reached 4,691 outside China, 9 and the number is still increasing. South Korea, the worst affected country outside China, has reported another jump. The 571 new cases brought South Korea\u2019s total confirmed cases to 2,337. A surge in cases of COVID-19 in Italy, Japan and Iran also heightened fears that the world is on the brink of a pandemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] In Feb 28, WHO increased the assessment of the risk of spread and risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at the global level.",
            "Recently, many researchers devoted to more details about the analysis of the spread of epidemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] Some paralleled results have shown that the reproductive number R0 estimated of COVID-19 is bigger than that of SARS based on different models. 16-18 With the limited number of data points and the complexity of the real situation, a straightforward model is expected to work better (see Discussion). In this study, we propose a \u201clog-plus\u201d model for the situation prediction which only requires daily number of total diagnosis outside China. This model assumes that there were some unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China and exponential growth later. Despite the simplicity of our model, it fits the data well (R2=0.991). The prediction is expected to provide practical significance on social application and evidence for enhancing public health interventions to avoid severe outbreaks."
