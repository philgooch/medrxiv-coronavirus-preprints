        "abstract": "Starting from December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, was found to cause Severe Acute Respiratory (SARI) symptoms and rapid pandemic in China. With the hope to identify candidate drugs for 2019-nCoV, we adopted a computational approach to screen for available commercial medicines which may function as inhibitors for the Mpro of 2019-nCoV. Up to 10 commercial medicines that may form hydrogen bounds to key residues within the binding pocket of 2019-nCoV Mpro were identified, which may have higher mutation tolerance than lopinavir/ritonavir and may also function as inhibitors for other coronaviruses with similar Mpro binding sites and pocket structures.",

Previous studies have found that six strains of coronaviruses are capable to infect human, including four strains circulating yearly to cause common cold, and other two strains which the source for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), respectively (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCui_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rCui_et+al_2019_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCui_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rCui_et+al_2019_a\">Cui et al, 2019</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDhama_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rDhama_et+al_2014_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDhama_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rDhama_et+al_2014_a\">Dhama et al, 2014</a></a>).<br/><br/>Starting from December 2019, a novel coronavirus, which was later named 2019nCoV (\u2018n\u2019 stands for novel), was found to cause Severe Acute Respiratory (SARI) symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, asthenia and pneumonia among people in Wuhan, China (Zhu et al, 2020; Lu et al, 2020; Hui et al, 2020). The first batch of patients infected by 2019-nCoV were almost all connected to a seafood market in Wuhan, which also trades wild animals.

            "A previous attempt to predict drugs for the Mpro of SARS-CoV has identified two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, namely lopinavir and ritonavir, as potential candidates, both of which bind to the same target site of Mpro (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNukoolkarn_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rNukoolkarn_et+al_2008_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNukoolkarn_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rNukoolkarn_et+al_2008_a\">Nukoolkarn et al, 2008</a></a>). Clinical application of these two drugs on 2019-nCoV patients also appears to be effective, demonstrating the importance of the drug binding site for suppressing 2019-nCoV Mpro activity.<br/><br/>To search for other drugs that may inhibit 2019-nCoV Mpro, we first evaluated the sequence and structural conservation of lopinavir/ritonavir bind site between SARSCoV and 2019-nCoV. The protein sequences of SARS-CoV Mpro and 2019-nCoV Mpro are 96% identical (Figure 1a), and the spatial structure of the previously reported lopinavir/ritonavir bind pocket is also conserved between SARS-CoV Mpro and 2019nCoV Mpro (Figure 1b). The conserved amino acids Thr24-Asn28 and Asn119 (numbered according to positions in SARS-CoV Mpro as the present sequence of 2019nCoV Mpro in GenBank is in polypeptide form) formed the binding pockets for lopinavir/ritonavir in the spatial structure of both SARS-CoV Mpro and 2019-nCoV Mpro, whereas the nearby non-conserved amino acids locate far away from the binding pocket, thus would not affect its structural conservation (Figure 1b). Virtual docking of lopinavir/ritonavir to 2019-nCoV Mpro also showed high binding ability to the pocket site (Figure 1c), similar to previous report for SARS-CoV Mpro (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNukoolkarn_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rNukoolkarn_et+al_2008_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNukoolkarn_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rNukoolkarn_et+al_2008_a\">Nukoolkarn et al, 2008</a></a>). Amino acids Thr24, Thr26, and Asn119 were predicted to be the key residues for binding the drugs (Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure 1), forming 2 hydrogen bonds with lopinavir and 2 hydrogen bonds with ritonavir, respectively.<br/><br/>Basing on these results, we performed virtual docking to screen for commercial medicines in the DrugBank database that could bind to the above mentioned pocket site of 2019-nCoV Mpro, and identified 10 candidate clinical medicines (Table 1, Figure 1d and Supplementary Figure 2). These drugs could form hydrogen bonds with one or more residues among Thr24-Asn28 and Asn119, theoretically, are capable to bind to the pocket formed by these amino acids and interfere the function of 2019-nCoV Mpro. In summary, basing on the structural information of clinical effective medicines for<br/><br/>2019-nCoV, we have predicted a list of commercial medicines which may function as inhibitors for 2019-nCoV by targeting its main protease Mpro. Compared to lopinavir/ritonavir, most of these predicted drugs could form more hydrogen bounds with 2019-nCoV Mpro, thus may have higher mutation tolerance than lopinavir/ritonavir. The binding pockets of these drugs on Mpro are conserved between SARS-CoV Mpro and 2019-nCoV Mpro, indicating the potential of these drugs to function as inhibitors for other coronaviruses with similar Mpro binding sites and pocket structures."
