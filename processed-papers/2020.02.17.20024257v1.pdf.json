        "abstract": "By proposing a varying coefficient Susceptible-Infected-Removal model (vSIR), we track the epidemic of COVID-19 in 30 provinces in China and 15 cities in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.",

            "The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created a profound public health emergency in China and has spread to 25 countries so far [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. It has become an epidemic with more than 71,000 confirmed infections and<br/><br/>1,775 reported deaths worldwide as on February 17 2020. The COVID-19 is caused by a new corona viruses that is genetically similar to the viruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Despite a relatively lower fatality rate comparing to SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 spreads faster and infects much more people than the SARS-03 outbreak.<br/><br/>The city of Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak, has been locked up to curtail population movement since January 23 in an effort to stop the spread of the epidemic, followed by more than 50 prefecture level cities (as on 8th of February) and countless number of towns and villages in China. A high percentage of the population are exercising self-isolation in their homes. The spring festival holiday period had been extended with all schools and universities closed and all students staying where they are indefinitely. The country is virtually in a stand-still, and the economy and people\u2019s livelihood have been severely affected by the epidemic.<br/><br/>There is an urgent need to assess the speed of the disease transmission and to check if the existing containment measures have successfully slowed down the spread of the disease or not. The Susceptible-Infected-Removal (SIR) model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and its generalizations, for instance the SEIR model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] with four or more compartments are commonly used to model the dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks. See [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] for statistical estimation and inference for stochastic versions of the SIR model. SEIR models have been used to produce early results on COVID-19 in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], which produced the first three estimates of the all important basic reproduction number R0 : 2.68 by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], 3.81 by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and 6.47 by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The R0 is the expected number of infections by one infectious person during the course of his/her infectious period, and is a key measure of an epidemic. If R0 < 1, the epidemic will die down eventually with the speed of the decline depends on how small R0 is; otherwise, the epidemic will explode until it runs out of its course.<br/><br/>The SEIR models that was employed in the above three cited works for the<br/><br/>COVID-19 assume constant model coefficients, implying a constant regime of transmission during the course of the epidemic. This is too idealistic for modeling COVID-19 as it cannot reflect the intervention measures by the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.<br/><br/>authorities and the citizens, which should have made the infectious rate (\u03b2) and the reproduction number (R0 ) varying with respect to the time.<br/><br/>To reflect the changes due to the strong government intervention and self protection, we propose a varying coefficient SIR (vSIR) model, which can capture the varying dynamics of the epidemic. The vSIR model is easy to be implemented via the locally weighted regression approach [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] that produces estimates with desired smoothness, and yet is able to capture the changing dynamics of COVID-19\u2019s reproduction, with guaranteed statistical consistency and needed standard errors. The consistent estimator and its confidence interval are needed for estimating the trend of R0 , assessing the effectiveness of infection control (R0 is significantly less than 1 continuously for 7 days), and predicting the final number of infection cases and the future epidemic trend."
        ],
        "results": [
            "By applying the vSIR model, we produce daily estimates of the infectious rate \u03b2(t) and the reproduction number R0 (t) (t denotes time) for 30 provinces and 15 major cities (including Wuhan) in Hubei province from January 21 or a later date between January 24-29 depending on the first confirmed case to February 10. We report standard error in the parentheses following the estimate.<br/><br/>2.1. Main findings<br/><br/>\u2022 Despite the total number of confirmed cases and the death are increasing, the spread of COVID-19 has shown a great slowing down in China within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10 as shown by<br/><br/>88.0% and 86.8% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the provinces and the 15 cities in Hubei, respectively.<br/><br/>\u2022 The average R014 (based on 14-day infectious duration) on January 27th was 6.42 (1.57) and 7.67 (2.46), respectively, for the 27 provinces and the 7 Hubei cities with confirmed cases by January 23rd. One week later on February 3rd, the R014 was averaged at 2.39 (0.70) for the 30 provinces and 2.94 (0.56) for the 15 Hubei cities, representing 62.8%<br/><br/>and 61.7% reductions, respectively, over the 7 days. On February 10th, the average R014 dropped further to 0.77 (0.33) for the 30 provinces and<br/><br/>1.01 (0.43) for the 15 Hubei cities, which were either below or close to the critical threshold level 1.<br/><br/>\u2022 The profound slowing down in the reproductivity of COVID-19 can be attributed to a series of action and measures by the government and the public, which include cutting off Wuhan and other cities from<br/><br/>January 23, a rapid public awareness of the epidemic and the extensive self protection taken and high level of self isolation at home exercised over a much extended Spring Festival holiday period.<br/><br/>\u2022 There are increasing numbers of provinces and cities in Hubei whose<br/><br/>14-day R0 has been statistically below 1, as detailed in Table 1, which would foreshadow the coming of the turning point for containment of the epidemic, if the control measures implemented since January 23 can be continued.<br/><br/>\u2022 If the current decreasing trend of R0 continues, Hubei will reach peak infection between February 20 and February 22. Many non-Hubei provinces have already reached the peak. If the recovery rate can be increased to 0.1 meaning the average recover time is 10 days after diagnosis, the number of infected patients I(t) will be dramatically reduced in March, and the epidemic will end in early June; see Figure 3.<br/><br/>\u2022 The eventual control of COVID-19 is rested on if the existing control measures can be continued further for a period of time. The biggest challenges that can jeopardize the great effort from late January are from the impatient populations eager to get out of the self-isolation driven by either economic needs (migrant workers eager to coming back to cities for income) or people trying to escape from the boredness of self isolation while encouraged by the declining infections in the last two weeks.<br/><br/>\u2022 The implications of China\u2019s experience in combating COVID-19 to other countries facing the epidemic are two folds. One is to reduce the person-to-person contact rate by self isolation and curtailing of population movement; another is to reduce the transmission probability by wearing protective wears should a contact has to be made.<br/><br/>2.2. Basic reproduction number<br/><br/>At a date t, the reproduction number based on an average infectious duration D is R0D (t) = \u03b2(t)D where \u03b2(t) is the daily infection rate at t. We do not adopt the version involving \u03b3, the removal rate, since its estimation is highly volatile at the early<br/><br/>R t+D2 stage of an epidemic. A general version of<br/><br/>R0 (t) may be defined as t\u2212D1 \u03b2(u)du where positive D1 and D2 represent the infectious durations before and after diagnosis, respectively. The R0D (t) given above can be viewed as an approximation by the Middle Value Theorem in calculus with D = D1 + D2 .<br/><br/>Research works [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] so far on COVID-19 have informed a range of duration for incubation, from onset of illness to diagnosis and then to hospitalization. The average incubation period from the three studies ranged from 3.0 to 5.2 days; the median duration from onset to diagnosis was 4 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]; and the mean duration from onset to first medical visit and then to hospitalization were 4.6 and 9.1 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], respectively. Based on a data sample of 391 cases from Shenzhen, the average incubation period was 4.46<br/><br/>(0.26) days and the average duration from onset to hospitalization were 3.9<br/><br/>(0.19) days, respectively, where standard error is reported in the parentheses. Another dataset of 100 confirmed cases in Shaoyang (Hunan Province) revealed the average durations from onset to diagnosis and from diagnosis to discharge were 5.67 (0.39) and 10.12 (0.43) days, respectively. There is a recent revelation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] that asymptomatic patients can be infectious, which would certainly prolong the infectious duration.<br/><br/>There are much variation in the medical capability in timely diagnosis and hospitalization (thus quarantine) of the infected across the country. Thus, the infectious duration D would vary among the provinces and cities, and would change with respect to the stage of the epidemic as well.<br/><br/>Given the diverse range of infectious duration across the provinces and cities, in order to standardize and make the reproduction number R0 readily comparable, we calculated the R0D based on three levels of D: 7, 10.5 and days, which represent three scenarios of responsiveness in diagnosing, hospitalization and hence quarantine of the infected.

            "Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) be the counts of susceptible, infected and recovered (including dead) persons in a given city or province at time t, respectively.<br/><br/>Let N be the total population of the city/province. We propose a varying coefficient Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (vSIR) model to estimate the dynamics of COVID-19 and predict its future course of spread.    3.1. Data<br/><br/>The daily records of infected, dead and recovered patients released by<br/><br/>National Health Commission of China (NHCC) are obtained from the NHCC website, with the first confirmed record for Wuhan on December 8th, 2019, followed by 30 provinces in mainland China and 15 cities in Hubei province where Wuhan is the capital city. We did not consider data from Tibet due to very small number of cases. Table A3 in SI provides the starting dates of the data records and analysis for each province and city. Due to severe under-reporting in the first 39 days of the epidemics in Wuhan and Hubei, we consider data from January 16th for Wuhan and Hubei. For other provinces and Hubei cities, the starting dates for data are those of first confirmed case, and the analysis date started four days afterward due to the estimation approach for estimating the infectious rate \u03b2(t). The latest start for analysis was January 29th for Qinghai province and three cities in Hubei province.<br/><br/>The second last date was January 28th that started 2 provinces and 5 Hubei cities.<br/><br/>The data from Shenzhen Government Online are epidemic statistics released by the Shenzhen Municipal Health Commission from January 19th to<br/><br/>February 13th [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. One dataset about the details of confirmed cases contains the time of onset, time of hospital admission, cause of illness and other information of 391 cases, including 188 males and 203 females. The admission time of these cases ranged from January 9th to February 11th. The other dataset reports the discharge time for 94 cases in the former dataset.<br/><br/>Besides, the dataset of 100 confirmed cases was released by the Shaoyang<br/><br/>Municipal Health Committee [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] on February 14 that includes 48 males and females with the onset dates ranging from January 12 to February 11.<br/><br/>3.2. Time-varying coefficient SIR model<br/><br/>The Susceptible-Infective-Removal (SIR) model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] is a commonly used epidemiology model for the dynamic of susceptible S(t), infected I(t) and recovered R(t) as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Here we consider a more generalized version of the SIR model in that the infectious rate \u03b2 and the removal rate \u03b3 may change with respect to time so that    S(t) dS(t)    = \u2212\u03b2(t)I(t)    , dt    N dI(t)    = \u03b2(t)I(t)<br/><br/>\u2212 \u03b3(t)I(t), dt dR(t)<br/><br/>= \u03b3(t)I(t), dt (1)<br/><br/>where \u03b2(t) and \u03b3(t) are unknown functions of time.<br/><br/>The rationale for using a time-varying \u03b2(t) function, rather than a constant \u03b2, is that \u03b2(t) is the average rate of contact per unit time multiplied by the probability of disease transmission per contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject. Due to an increasing public awareness of the epidemic and the control measures put in place, both the transmission probability and the contact rate have been reduced due to protective wear (face mask), avoidance of close contacts and self isolation. These favors for a time-varying \u03b2(t) are also confirmed by the sharp declined in R0D (t) in Figures 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The removal rate will also change over time as treatments improve over time.<br/><br/>However, our analysis (Figure S4 in SI) shows \u03b3(t) is much slowly changing for most of the provinces, which led us to treat \u03b3(t) = \u03b3 at current stage of the outbreak.<br/><br/>3.3. Estimation and inference<br/><br/>The reported numbers of infected and removed cases are subject to measurement errors. To reduce the errors, we apply a three point moving average = 0.3I(t\u22121)+0.4I(t)+0.3I(t+1)<br/><br/>filter on the reported counts to obtain I(t) for 2 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 1 where T is the latest time point of observation. In our analysis, T is February 13 2020. For t = 1 or T , we apply two point averaging with 7/10 weight at t = 1 or T , and 3/10 for t = 2 or T \u2212 1. Apply the same filtering on the recovered process R(t) and obtain R(t). To simply the notaand R(t) as I(t) and R(t) respectively, tion, we denote the filtered data I(t) wherever there is no confusion.<br/><br/>Let \u2206\u03b4 Rt = Rt+\u03b4 \u2212 Rt for t = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T \u2212 \u03b4. From the third equation in (1), we estimate \u03b3 by least square fitting of \u2206\u03b4 Rt on I(t) without intercept.<br/><br/>We estimate \u03b2(t) \u2212 \u03b3 by a local linear regression on log{I(t)}. Let \u03b3and    \\    d d \u03b2(t)<br/><br/>\u2212 \u03b3 be the estimators, and Var(\u03b3) and Var(\u03b2(t)<br/><br/>\u2212 \u03b3) be their estimated variances. Their close form expressions are provided in Section S.1 in SI.<br/><br/>Then, \u03b2(t) = \u03b2(t)<br/><br/>\u2212 \u03b3 + \u03b3is the estimate for the varying coefficient \u03b2(t) in d (1). The standard error of \u03b2(t) can be obtained as SE\u03b2 (t) = {Var(\u03b2(t)    \u2212<br/><br/>d \u03b3) + Var(\u03b3)} . The 95% confidence interval for \u03b2(t) can be constructed as (\u03b2(t) \u2212 1.96SE\u03b2 (t), \u03b2(t) + 1.96SE\u03b2 (t)).    (2)<br/><br/>In the implementation, we chose \u03b4 = 2 and w = 5. Figure S1 in SI shows that the proposed vSIR model fits the observed infected number I(t) well for provinces in China.<br/><br/>3.4. Prediction for infection rate and state variables<br/><br/>As R0D (t) = \u03b2(t) \u00d7 D, predicting \u03b2(t) is equivalent to predicting R0D (t).<br/><br/>From Figure 1 and Figure S2 in SI, we see that the overall trends of \u03b2(t) is decreasing. But the rate of deceasing gets smaller as time travels. To model such trend, we consider the reciprocal regression \u03b2(t) =    t\u03b7 b    + et    \u2212a (3)<br/><br/>with error et and unknown parameters a, b and \u03b7. The parameters a, b and \u03b7 are estimated by minimizing the sum-of-square distance between the estimates \u03b2(t) and their fitted values. Let \u00e3, band \u03b7be the estimated parameters, and \u03b2(t) = b/(t\u03b7 \u2212 \u00e3) be the fitted function. Figure S3 in SI shows the reciprocal model fits \u03b2(t) quite well for most of the provinces, especially those with large number of infected cases.<br/><br/>With the fitted \u03b2(t), we project {S(t), I(t), R(t)} via the ODEs d\u015c(t)    \u02c6 \u015c(t) , dt    NdI(t)<br/><br/>\u02c6 \u015c(t) \u2212 \u03b3T I(t), \u02c6    = \u03b3T I(t).    (4)<br/><br/>where \u03b3T is the estimatedrecovery rate at time T using the last five days\u2019<br/><br/>data. With the observed S(T ), I(T ), R(T ) at the current time T as the<br/><br/>\u02c6 R(t)) : T \u2264 t < \u221e for the initial values, numerical solutions (\u015c(t), I(t), system (4) could be obtained using the Euler method. Then, the peak timeof the number of infected cases can be predicted as tpeak = arg maxt I(t),<br/><br/>\u02c6 end ), where and the estimated final infected number is Nfinal = R(tend ) + I(t tend = min t : I(t) < 1 is the estimated ending time. The 95% prediction intervals for the peak time, end time and final infected number are obtained by bootstrap resampling method. The details of the bootstrap prediction inference is provided in Section S.2 in SI."

            "1,775 reported deaths worldwide as on February 17 2020. The COVID-19 is caused by a new corona viruses that is genetically similar to the viruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Despite a relatively lower fatality rate comparing to SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 spreads faster and infects much more people than the SARS-03 outbreak.",
            "The city of Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak, has been locked up to curtail population movement since January 23 in an effort to stop the spread of the epidemic, followed by more than 50 prefecture level cities (as on 8th of February) and countless number of towns and villages in China. A high percentage of the population are exercising self-isolation in their homes. The spring festival holiday period had been extended with all schools and universities closed and all students staying where they are indefinitely. The country is virtually in a stand-still, and the economy and people\u2019s livelihood have been severely affected by the epidemic.",
            "There is an urgent need to assess the speed of the disease transmission and to check if the existing containment measures have successfully slowed down the spread of the disease or not. The Susceptible-Infected-Removal (SIR) model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and its generalizations, for instance the SEIR model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] with four or more compartments are commonly used to model the dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks. See [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] for statistical estimation and inference for stochastic versions of the SIR model. SEIR models have been used to produce early results on COVID-19 in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], which produced the first three estimates of the all important basic reproduction number R0 : 2.68 by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], 3.81 by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and 6.47 by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The R0 is the expected number of infections by one infectious person during the course of his/her infectious period, and is a key measure of an epidemic. If R0 < 1, the epidemic will die down eventually with the speed of the decline depends on how small R0 is; otherwise, the epidemic will explode until it runs out of its course.",

The trajectories of I(t) under the proposed vSIR model with the estimated recovery rate and \u03b3 = 0.1 are presented in Figure 3. With a higher recovery rate of 0.1, the duration of the epidemic will be shorten substantially. Figure 3 indicates that the number of infected will quickly decease in late February and March with very few cases left in April. The ending time for Hubei will be brought early to June 2020 with total number of infection reduced to the range 69,896\u201373,460, down by 14,076\u201318,643. Most of the non-Hubei provinces will end in April, 2020. Some provinces with few number of total infected cases may end as early as March (Qinghai, Jilin, Neimenggu). This shows that improving the recovery rate is an efficient way to end the COVID-19 infection early given the current decreasing trend of \u03b2(t), as it leads to the reduction of the infectious duration."
