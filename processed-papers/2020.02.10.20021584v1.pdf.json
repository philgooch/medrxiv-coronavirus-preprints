Diagnosis of 2019-nCoV pneumonia and clinical classification according to the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial version 4) developed by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). The clinical classifications are as follows: (1) mild, with fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and imaging shows pneumonia. (2) moderate, meet any of the following: a) respiratory distress, respiratory rate \u2265 30 beats / min; b) in the resting state, means oxygen saturation \u2264 93%; c) arterial blood oxygen partial pressure / oxygen concentration \u2264 300mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133kPa). (3) severe, one of the following conditions: a) respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation; b) Shock occurs; c) ICU admission is required for combined organ failure. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Ditan Hospital, and all patients signed the informed consent.<br/><br/>Baseline data collection<br/><br/>All suspected 2019-nCoV infection patients were taken upper respiratory throat swab samples at admission and stored in virus transport medium, which were transported to Beijing CDC for laboratory diagnosis. Influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H7N9), influenza B virus, bacterial and fungal detections of sputum or respiratory secretions were performed at this hospital. Epidemiological history, comorbidity, vital signs, symptoms and signs were recorded in detail, and laboratory tests including biochemical Indicators, blood routine, C-reactive protein, chest radiograph or CT scan.    Follow-up<br/><br/>After admission, the patients were re-examined for laboratory indexes and imaging examination, and recorded symptoms and signs, treatments and outcome events. The endpoint of this study was the severe illness developed.<br/><br/>Statistical analysis<br/><br/>Age and days were represented by median (range), categorical variables by number (%), and laboratory data by mean (interquartile range). The cutoff value of neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated based on the maximum Youden index. Compared the differences between the two groups with t-test, chi-square test or MannWhitney U test. LASSO COX regression was used to select independent risk factors that affect outcomes. Analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 statistical package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R version 3.0.2 was used to establish nomogram, calibration, decision curve and clinical impact curve. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

None of the 61 patients had a history of Huanan seafood market exposure in Wuhan, 17 of them (27.9%) had not left Beijing recently, but had a close exposure history with 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients, and the other 44 (72.1%) patients were Wuhan citizens or visited Wuhan recently. There was no significant difference of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease between the two groups, but the patients with hypertension in the severe group were more than those in the mild group (p = 0.056) (Table 1). Among 61 cases, 60 (98.4%) cases had fever, 5 (8.2%) cases had high fever ( > 39 \u00b0C), 3 (4.9%) cases had dyspnea. 7 (11.5%) cases had mild shortness of breath. Most of the patients in the severe group had cough, sputum production, and fatigue. 11 (18.0%) cases had gastrointestinal symptoms. Blood neutrophil count in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the mild group, blood lymphocyte count, serum sodium and chlorine levels were significantly lower, and the rate of bacterial infection was significantly increased (Table 1).

Patients were divided into two strata according to the cutoff value of NLR (low risk: < 3.13; high risk: \u2265 3.13) and age (age < 50 years; age \u2265 50 years). Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed significant statistical differences in the two groups (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.00028) (Figure 3A and 3B). Furthermore, patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were stratified for severe illness incidence with respect to age with NLR (strata 1: age < 50 years and NLR < 3.13; strata 2: age < 50 years and NLR \u2265 3.13; strata 3: age \u2265 50 years and NLR < 3.13; strata 4: age \u2265 50 years and NLR \u2265 3.13). There was no severe illness case in the strata 1 and strata 2, 1 (9.1%) case in the strata 3 and 7 (50%) cases in the strata 4. As shown in Figure 3C, the severe illness incidence was significantly different between strata 3 and 4 (p = 0.0195), but the difference between the strata 2 and 3 was not significant (p = 0.4142).<br/><br/>resources, especially critical care resources. If severe cases can be identified as early as possible, risk stratification management will help alleviate insufficient medical resources and might reduce mortality. No risk predictive model of severe illness about 2019-nCoV pneumonia has been published to date.<br/><br/>Most of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients in the hospital were from Wuhan. Patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia on early onset were not very severe. The median time from onset to admission of severe patients and mild patients was similar, but the severe patients deteriorated on 7-14 days of illness course and developed to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. The severe or death patients with 2019-nCoV infection were mostly old age with comorbidities.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] In the study, severe ill ones are all over 50 years old. The decrease of lymphocyte count was related to the progress of the disease. we proposed that blood lymphocyte related index may be a potential predictor. The NLR was a widely used marker for the assessment of the severity of bacterial infections and the prognosis of patients with pneumonia and tumors. The increase of NLR indicated poor clinical prognosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] The results indicated that 2019-nCoV may act on T lymphocytes, and T lymphocyte damage is an important factor that causes patients to deteriorate[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In addition, patients with severe illness might have bacterial infection due to low immune function. The latest report followed up the laboratory test results of patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and found that 5 patients had a rising neutrophil count and a falling lymphocyte count before their deaths.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]<br/><br/>In the study, the data of 61 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were analyzed, the baseline characteristics of patients in the mild and severe groups were described and compared, and the dynamic changes of laboratory indexes and imaging were demonstrated. The independent risk factors affecting incidence of severe illness were screened. The results showed that NLR was the most significant factor affecting the severe illness incidence, and it had significant predictive value. Furthermore, according to the NLR and age stratification, the incidence of severe ill ones with NLR \u2265 3.13 and aged \u2265 50 years old was 50%, and 9.1% in age \u2265 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients.<br/><br/>Previous studies showed that the MuLBSTA score can early warn the mortality of viral pneumonia, which included six indicators, such as age, smoking history, hypertension, bacterial co-infection, lymphopenia, and multilobular infiltration.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] CURB-65 score was widely used to evaluate 30-day mortality of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] In the study, NLR was compared with MuLBSTA and CURB-65 scoring models, the results showed that NLR had higher AUC, c-index, sensitivity and specificity, which indicated that NLR was better than the other two models in early predicting the incidence of severe illness. Furthermore, it was found that the prediction effect of the NLR-MuLBSTA and NLR-CURB-65 models was better than that of the original model. But NLR was an easy-to-use predictor index.<br/><br/>Based on the results, we suggest that patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia can improve risk stratification and management according to NLR and age model. Patients with age < 50 years old and NLR < 3.13 who are no risk should be treated in a community hospital or home isolation. Patients with age < 50 years old and NLR \u2265 3.13 who are low risk need to be general isolation ward. Patients with age \u2265 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients who are moderate risk, should be admitted to isolation ward with respiratory monitoring and supportive care. Patients with age \u2265 50 and NLR \u2265 3.13 who are high risk should actively transfer to ICU with invasive respiratory support equipment (Figure 3D). If there are large-scale cases, the risk stratification and management will help alleviate the shortage of medical resources and reduce the mortality of critical patients.<br/><br/>There were some limitations in the study. First, the study was a single center with small sample and no external validation cohort. Second, most of patients are still in hospital, whose condition maybe change in follow-up. And the study has not included the final survival outcome. However, we focused on the early identification of critical cases for risk stratification and management. We expect that the risk model can help alleviate the shortage of medical resources and manage the patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia."

In the following month, 2019-nCoV was transmitted in Hubei Province, throughout China and even other countries,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] causing 34,662 confirmed cases by February 8, 2020.<br/><br/>Most patients with novel coronavirus infection were mild. Moderate illness often experienced dyspnea after one week. Severe ill patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and septic shock. Early identification of risk factors for severe illness facilitated appropriate supportive care and promptly access to the intensive care unit (ICU) if necessary. For mild patients, general isolation and symptomatic treatment were available, and ICU-care was needed unless the condition worsens rapidly, such to reduce the mortality and alleviate the shortage of medical resources.<br/><br/>We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics, imaging features, treatments, and outcomes of patients with mild and moderate or severe 2019-nCoV infection, to explore the most useful prognostic factor for accurate individualized assessment of the severe incidence of 2019-nCoV infection."

Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed significant statistical differences in the two groups (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.00028) (Figure 3A and 3B).

            "Most of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients in the hospital were from Wuhan. Patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia on early onset were not very severe. The median time from onset to admission of severe patients and mild patients was similar, but the severe patients deteriorated on 7-14 days of illness course and developed to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. The severe or death patients with 2019-nCoV infection were mostly old age with comorbidities.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] In the study, severe ill ones are all over 50 years old. The decrease of lymphocyte count was related to the progress of the disease. we proposed that blood lymphocyte related index may be a potential predictor. The NLR was a widely used marker for the assessment of the severity of bacterial infections and the prognosis of patients with pneumonia and tumors. The increase of NLR indicated poor clinical prognosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] The results indicated that 2019-nCoV may act on T lymphocytes, and T lymphocyte damage is an important factor that causes patients to deteriorate[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In addition, patients with severe illness might have bacterial infection due to low immune function. The latest report followed up the laboratory test results of patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and found that 5 patients had a rising neutrophil count and a falling lymphocyte count before their deaths.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]",
            "In the study, the data of 61 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were analyzed, the baseline characteristics of patients in the mild and severe groups were described and compared, and the dynamic changes of laboratory indexes and imaging were demonstrated. The independent risk factors affecting incidence of severe illness were screened. The results showed that NLR was the most significant factor affecting the severe illness incidence, and it had significant predictive value. Furthermore, according to the NLR and age stratification, the incidence of severe ill ones with NLR \u2265 3.13 and aged \u2265 50 years old was 50%, and 9.1% in age \u2265 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients.",
            "Previous studies showed that the MuLBSTA score can early warn the mortality of viral pneumonia, which included six indicators, such as age, smoking history, hypertension, bacterial co-infection, lymphopenia, and multilobular infiltration.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] CURB-65 score was widely used to evaluate 30-day mortality of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] In the study, NLR was compared with MuLBSTA and CURB-65 scoring models, the results showed that NLR had higher AUC, c-index, sensitivity and specificity, which indicated that NLR was better than the other two models in early predicting the incidence of severe illness. Furthermore, it was found that the prediction effect of the NLR-MuLBSTA and NLR-CURB-65 models was better than that of the original model. But NLR was an easy-to-use predictor index.",
            "Based on the results, we suggest that patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia can improve risk stratification and management according to NLR and age model. Patients with age < 50 years old and NLR < 3.13 who are no risk should be treated in a community hospital or home isolation. Patients with age < 50 years old and NLR \u2265 3.13 who are low risk need to be general isolation ward. Patients with age \u2265 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients who are moderate risk, should be admitted to isolation ward with respiratory monitoring and supportive care. Patients with age \u2265 50 and NLR \u2265 3.13 who are high risk should actively transfer to ICU with invasive respiratory support equipment (Figure 3D). If there are large-scale cases, the risk stratification and management will help alleviate the shortage of medical resources and reduce the mortality of critical patients.",
            "There were some limitations in the study. First, the study was a single center with small sample and no external validation cohort. Second, most of patients are still in hospital, whose condition maybe change in follow-up. And the study has not included the final survival outcome. However, we focused on the early identification of critical cases for risk stratification and management. We expect that the risk model can help alleviate the shortage of medical resources and manage the patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia."

In the following month, 2019-nCoV was transmitted in Hubei Province, throughout China and even other countries,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] causing 34,662 confirmed cases by February 8, 2020.",
            "Most patients with novel coronavirus infection were mild. Moderate illness often experienced dyspnea after one week. Severe ill patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and septic shock. Early identification of risk factors for severe illness facilitated appropriate supportive care and promptly access to the intensive care unit (ICU) if necessary. For mild patients, general isolation and symptomatic treatment were available, and ICU-care was needed unless the condition worsens rapidly, such to reduce the mortality and alleviate the shortage of medical resources.",
            "We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics, imaging features, treatments, and outcomes of patients with mild and moderate or severe 2019-nCoV infection, to explore the most useful prognostic factor for accurate individualized assessment of the severe incidence of 2019-nCoV infection."
