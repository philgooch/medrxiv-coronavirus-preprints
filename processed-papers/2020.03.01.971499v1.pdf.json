        "abstract": "Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is associated with respiratory disease and is prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. Interaction between the coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells. We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, proving that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and may help to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential.",

            "Coronaviruses are the largest group within the order Nidovirales. Mainly, they cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals, but some can cause more serious conditions such as hepatitis, peritonitis, or neurological disease. Seven coronaviruses infect humans, four of which (human coronavirus [HCoV]-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and<br/><br/>HCoV-HKU1) cause relatively mild upper and lower respiratory tract disease and two (SARS-<br/><br/>CoV and MERS-CoV) are associated with severe, life-threatening respiratory infections and multiorgan failure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Furthermore, in December 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Hubei province, China, causing pneumonia. To date, almost 90,000 cases were identified and 3,000 patients died worldwide.<br/><br/>Coronaviral infection is initiated by interaction between the trimeric spike (S) protein and its receptor, which is expressed on the surface of the susceptible cell. A number of adhesion and entry receptors have been described for coronaviruses. For example, HCoV-229E (similar to many other alphacoronaviruses) utilizes aminopeptidase N (APN) as the primary entry port [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Surprisingly, its cousin HCoV-NL63 shares receptor specificity with the evolutionarily distant SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: all hijack angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (8-<br/><br/>11). HCoV-NL63 was also shown to use heparan sulfate as a primary attachment site [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].<br/><br/>A very different receptor is recognized by MERS-CoV, which binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4<br/><br/>(DPP4) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Another betacoronavirus, HCoV-OC43, binds to N-acetyl-9-O-<br/><br/>acetylneuraminic acid [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. HCoV-HKU1 remains the great unknown because its cellular receptor has not been identified and all efforts to culture the virus in vitro have failed.<br/><br/>HCoV-HKU1 was identified in Hong Kong in 2004. The virus was present in a sample obtained from an elderly patient with severe pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Epidemiological studies show a high prevalence of the pathogen in humans; this is because the majority of children seroconvert before the age of 6 years [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. While it is not possible to culture HCoV-HKU1 in vitro, we and others reported that ex vivo fully differentiated human airway epithelium (HAE) and human alveolar type II cells support the infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. A thorough study by Huang X et al.<br/><br/>demonstrated that HCoV-HKU1 binds to target cells via O-acetylated sialic acids on the cell surface; however, this interaction is not sufficient for the infection. The study also showed that the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of HCoV-HKU1 exhibits sialate-O-acetylesterase activity and may act as a receptor-destroying enzyme, thereby facilitating the release of viral progeny [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Bakkers et al proposed that, in order to adapt to the sialoglycome of the human respiratory tract over the evolutionary timescale, HCoV-HKU1 lost the ability to bind to attachment receptors via the HE protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Recently, Hulswit et al mapped the virus binding site to O-acetylated sialic acids, demonstrating that the S1 domain A is responsible for binding to the attachment receptor [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>].<br/><br/>The S protein is the main player during coronavirus entry, and its characteristics determine the host range. Coronaviral S proteins are class I fusion proteins comprising a large<br/><br/>N-terminal ectodomain, a hydrophobic trans-membrane region, and a small C-terminal endodomain. The ectodomain is highly glycosylated and is composed of S1 and S2 domains.<br/><br/>The globular S1 domain is highly variable and carries the receptor-binding site, whereas the more conserved rod-like S2 domain undergoes structural rearrangement during entry, which brings the cellular and viral membranes into close proximity. Such a structural switch may be triggered by different stimuli, including receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage of the S protein, and/or a reduction in pH. Because different species require different stimuli, coronaviruses enter cells at different subcellular sites. Some coronaviruses fuse at the plasma membrane, whereas others are believed to enter the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by fusion deep within the endosomal compartments [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Furthermore, recent reports show that the entry portal may vary depending on tissue/cell characteristics. These differences may affect the host range, pathogenicity, and cell/tissue specificity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].<br/><br/>Host proteases prime coronaviral S proteins. For example, trypsin-mediated cleavage in the small intestine is required for entry of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>], while a number of coronaviruses from different genera (including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, murine hepatitis virus [MHV], MERS-CoV, and infectious bronchitis virus [IBV]) possess a furin cleavage site [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. Kam et al showed that SARS-CoV S protein can be cleaved by plasmin; however, there is almost no biological evidence for its role in vivo [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. Cathepsins may also act as S protein-activating enzymes. Indeed, cathepsin L processes the S proteins of SARS-<br/><br/>CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and MHV-2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>]. However, recent reports show that, in vivo, respiratory coronaviruses may be activated by the TMPRSS2 protease, which enables endocytosis-independent internalization, thereby re-shaping the entry process [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>].<br/><br/>While laboratory strains require priming by cathepsins, S proteins of clinical isolates (e.g., HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) undergo TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage at the cell surface, which enables them to fuse with the cell membrane on the cell surface [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. A recent study by<br/><br/>Shirato et al demonstrates that coronaviruses may lose their ability to infect naturally permissive HAE cultures during cell culture adaptation because the S gene evolves and adjusts to the proteolytic landscape of the immortalized cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>].<br/><br/>Here, we identified a protease belonging to the tissue kallikrein (KLK) family as a new player essential for HCoV-HKU1 entry to the target cell. The KLK family comprises 15 closely related serine proteases with trypsin- or chymotrypsin-like specificity. The expression of these enzymes is tightly regulated, and each tissue has its own unique KLK expression profile. These enzymes play a role in a diverse range of processes during embryonic development to adulthood [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>], and some have been linked to human cancers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>]. The function of some KLKs remains to be elucidated, but obtained results suggest that protease distribution may be an important factor pre-determining the cell and tissue specificity of the virus, but also regulating the interspecies transfers.<br/><br/>Further, the data presented herein bring us a step closer to developing a convenient in vitro culture model and possibly identifying the cellular receptor for this virus. It is also of importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses and may help to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential."

            "Several KLKs are upregulated after infection of HAE with HCoV-HKU1<br/><br/>First, we asked whether HCoV-HKU1 infection modulates the expression of human<br/><br/>KLKs. HAE cultures were infected with HCoV-HKU1 or mock-inoculated. At 120 h postinoculation (p.i.), cells were collected and the expression of mRNAs encoding KLKs was analyzed. We detected the expression of KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11, and KLK13 in non-infected fully differentiated cultures. However, the pattern in HCoV-HKU1-infected cells was different: we detected an upregulation of KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11 and KLK13.<br/><br/>Further, KLK1, KLK5, KLK6, KLK9, KLK12 and KLK14 were expressed in the infected cells.<br/><br/>KLK2, KLK3, and KLK15 were not expressed (Fig. 1).<br/><br/>KLK13 is essential for HCoV-HKU1 infection<br/><br/>S protein priming is a prerequisite for coronavirus entry; therefore, we tested whether<br/><br/>KLKs take part in this process by culturing cells in the presence/absence of KLK inhibitors (<br/><br/>Table 1) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>]. For this, HAE cultures were pre-incubated with each inhibitor (10 \u03bcM) or with vehicle control (DMSO) and mock-inoculated or inoculated with the virus (106 RNA copies per ml) in the presence of the inhibitor. Apical washes were collected each day for analysis of virus replication. Subsequently, viral RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed (RT), and the HCoV-<br/><br/>HKU1 yield was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The results showed that<br/><br/>HCoV-HKU1 replication was inhibited in the presence of a KLK13 inhibitor; this was not the case for cells treated with DMSO or with inhibitors specific for KLK7 or KLK8 (Fig. 2A).<br/><br/>Next, we analyzed HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of a family-specific KLK inhibitor SPINK6 at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>] or 100 \u03bcM camostat (a broad inhibitor of serine proteases, also a potent inhibitor of KLK13) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>]. We noted inhibition of<br/><br/>HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of both inhibitors (Fig. 2B). All inhibitors were used at non-toxic concentrations (Fig. 2C).<br/><br/>The experiments conducted so far suggested that KLK13 is required for virus infection.<br/><br/>However, one may question the specificity of the KLK13 protease inhibitors. To ensure that<br/><br/>KLK13 is indeed the priming enzyme during HCoV-HKU1 infection, we developed HAE cultures by transforming cells with lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs targeting KLK13<br/><br/>mRNA. We then confirmed that the expression of the protease was silenced (HAE_shKLK13).<br/><br/>Non-modified HAE cultures (HAE_ctrl), cultures modified using a lentiviral vector to express the GFP protein (HAE_GFP), and HAE cultures transduced with an empty lentiviral vector (HAE_vector) were used as controls. Following transduction and differentiation, expression of<br/><br/>KLK13 mRNA in HAE_shKLK13 was almost undetectable, in contrast to the control cultures (Fig. 3A). Importantly, HAE_shKLK13 cells continued to differentiate and formed pseudostratified cultures (Fig. 3B). Next, we infected HAE_ctrl, HAE_GFP, HAE_vector, and<br/><br/>HAE_shKLK13 with HCoV-HKU1 (106 RNA copies per ml) and incubated them for 2 h at<br/><br/>32\u00b0C with the viral stock solution. Cultures were maintained at 32\u00b0C for 5 days at an air-liquid interface. Apical washes were collected, and virus yield was determined by RT-qPCR. We found that, in contrast to that in control cultures, replication of virus in HAE_shKLK13 was abolished (Fig. 3C). Overall, these data suggest that silencing the KLK13 gene in HAE inhibits virus infection, indicating that KLK13 is necessary for HCoV-HKU1 infection.<br/><br/>KLK13 enables entry of HCoV-HKU1 pseudoviruses<br/><br/>We determined that KLK13 is essential for efficient HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE cultures and we started to wonder whether this enzyme may be a determinant of the cell and tissue specificity of the virus. Previous studies showed that RD cells support virus attachment via sialic acids, but this does not allow for the virus entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. To test whether cell surface proteases my render RD cells permissive, we generated RD cells expressing human KLK13 or<br/><br/>TMPRSS2 proteases. RD cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors harboring the KLK13 gene (RD_KLK13), control vector (RD_ctrl), or TMPRSS2 (RD_TMPRSS2). Due to the lack of KLK13 specific antibodies, we verified its presence based on RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). The presence of TMPRSS2 in RD_TMPRSS2 cells was confirmed using Western blot. The<br/><br/>TMPRSS2 band in RD cells was observed at 25 kDa, which corresponds to one of the naturally occurring splicing variants (Fig. 4B). Subsequently, we transduced RD_ctrl, RD_KLK13 and<br/><br/>RD_TMPRSS2 cells with HIV particles pseudotyped with HCoV-HKU1 S glycoprotein (S-HKU1), control VSV G protein (VSV-G) or lacking the fusion protein (\u0394Env). After 3 day culture at 37\u00b0C, pseudovirus entry was quantified by measurement of the luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 4C, all cultures were effectively transduced with control VSV-G vectors, while only RD_KLK13 cells were permissive to S-HKU1 pseudoviruses. This clearly showed that<br/><br/>KLK13, and not TMPRSS2 is involved in HCoV-HKU1 entry. Furthermore, S-HKU1,d VSV-<br/><br/>G and \u0394Env pseudoviruses were overlaid onto fully differentiated HAE cultures in the presence of KLK13 inhibitor (10 \u03bcM) or DMSO. After 3 day culture at 37\u00b0C pseudovirus entry was quantified by measurement of the luciferase activity. Despite low transduction efficiency in<br/><br/>HAE, we observed an increase in luciferase activity in cultures treated with S-HKU1 pseudoviruses, compared to \u0394Env, which was completely abolished in the presence of KLK13 inhibitor (Fig 4D). Overall, these data demonstrated that KLK13 activity drives HCoV-HKU1 entry into cells.<br/><br/>KLK13 enables the replication of HCoV-HKU1 in RD cells<br/><br/>Obtained results showed that KLK13 expression on RD cells was sufficient for HCoV-<br/><br/>HKU1 pseudovirus entry. Here, we aimed to test whether KLK13 presence renders RD cells permissive for HCoV-HKU1 infection. For this, we infected RD_ctrl and RD_KLK13 cells with HCoV-HKU1 (108 RNA copies per ml) and incubated the culture for 7 days at 32\u00b0C in the presence or absence of a KLK13 inhibitor (10 \u03bcM) or DMSO. Next, cellular RNA was isolated and the presence of HCoV-HKU1 N subgenomic mRNA (N sg mRNA), which is considered to be a hallmark of coronaviral infection, was assessed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. sg mRNA appeared in RD_KLK13 cells, while no signal was detected in cultures supplemented with the KLK13 inhibitor nor in<br/><br/>RD_ctrl cells (Fig. 5A).<br/><br/>To further confirm the role of KLK13 during HCoV-HKU1 infection RD cells were supplemented with purified human KLK13 or KLK14 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>]. The latter was used as a negative control. Virus stock was incubated for 2 h at 32\u00b0C with 200 nM KLK13, KLK14, or trypsin or control (PBS). Next, RD cells were incubated for 7 days at 32\u00b0C with the virus (diluted 10-fold in DMEM) or mock samples (in DMEM), after which cellular RNA was isolated and<br/><br/>HCoV-HKU1 infection was analyzed by means of N sg mRNA detection. Again, we found that<br/><br/>N sg mRNA was produced only in the presence of KLK13 (Fig. 5B). Further, we passaged<br/><br/>HCoV-HKU1 twice in RD cells. Briefly, 1 ml of cell culture supernatant from the first experiment was transferred to fresh RD cells and fresh enzymes were added (final concentration nM). Cultures were then incubated at 32\u00b0C for 7 days. Cellular RNA was isolated and<br/><br/>HCoV-HKU1 infection was monitored by detecting N sg mRNA. The infection occurred only in the presence of KLK13 (Fig. 5B). However, we observed no cytopathic effects (CPEs), and replication levels were very low (no significant increase over control levels on RT-qPCR; data not shown). To further test the effect of KLK13 on replication of HCoV-HKU1 in RD cells, the virus stock was incubated with purified KLK13 (200 nM) and incubated in the presence or absence of a KLK13 inhibitor (10 \u03bcM) or DMSO. After 2 h at 32\u00b0C pre-treated virus stock was diluted in media as described above and overlaid on RD cells. After 7 days at 32\u00b0C we evaluated the presence of the HCoV-HKU1 N sg mRNA. The virus replicated only after treatment with<br/><br/>KLK13, and supplementation with the inhibitor blocked this effect infection (Fig. 5C).<br/><br/>KLK13 primes the HCoV-HKU1 S protein<br/><br/>Expression of KLK13 by cells previously resistant to HCoV-HKU1 renders them susceptible; therefore, we asked whether this is due to proteolytic activation of the S protein.<br/><br/>We tested this using the CleavEx method, in which a peptide of interest is exposed in the<br/><br/>N-terminal region of the proteolytically-resistant HmuY carrier protein. Briefly, two-hybrid<br/><br/>His-tagged CleavEx proteins were prepared, both harboring 8-amino acid peptide sequences of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein. The first peptide contained the S1/S2 cleavage site (amino acids<br/><br/>757\u2013764), which in some coronaviruses is activated during protein biosynthesis, during virus exocytosis, or after receptor engagement. The second harbored the S2/S2\u2019 cleavage site (amino acids 901\u2013908), which is an additional region prone to proteolytic cleavage [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. Proteins were purified and further incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C with increasing concentrations of purified<br/><br/>KLK13. Subsequently, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by western blotting with antibodies specific for His-tagged proteins. The analysis showed that, in the presence of nM KLK13, the CleavEx protein harboring the S1/S2 cleavage site was degraded; however, the CleavEx protein harboring the S2/S2\u2019 site remained intact. Because KLKs are produced as pro-forms that undergo self-activation, an additional band of His-tagged purified pro-KLK13<br/><br/>(HisTag-pro-KLK13) was observed after treatment with 500 nM KLK13 (Fig. 6A). The product of the S1/S2 cleavage was further sequenced by N-terminal Edman degradation showing the following sequence: R\u2193SISA, which corresponds to the S1/S2 site. This result shows clearly that the S1/S2 region of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein is prone to KLK13-mediated cleavage.<br/><br/>Furthermore, we aimed to confirm the cleavage using a full-length Spike protein of<br/><br/>HCoV-HKU1 (HKU1-S). For this, we expressed the HKU1-S in 293T cells, purified the protein using 6 \u00d7 His tag, and incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C with increasing concentrations of purified<br/><br/>KLK13. Subsequently, HKU-S or mock proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by western blotting with antibodies specific to the tag. The analysis showed that in the presence of \u03bcM KLK13 the HKU1-S was degraded (Figure 6B). The S protein was observed at<br/><br/>~150 kDa, which is consistent with the migration speed reported for these highly glycosylated proteins [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]."

        "discussion": [
            "Receptor recognition is the first, essential step of the virus infection process. The coronaviral S protein mediates virus entry into host cells by binding to a specific receptor. A combination of stimuli, e.g., receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage, and exposure to low pH results in rearrangement of the S protein and, consequently, to membrane fusion and virus entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Although the structure of both the HCoV-HKU1 S ectodomain and the receptor-binding domain has been resolved, the receptor determinant remains unknown [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>]. In a previous study, we showed that HCoV-HKU1 utilizes O-acetylated sialic acids on host cells as an attachment receptor [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Here, we present data demonstrating that the protease KLK13 is required for HCoV-HKU1 infection of the respiratory epithelium.<br/><br/>Human KLKs take part in multiple physiological processes, including skin desquamation, tooth enamel formation, kidney and brain function, and synaptic neural plasticity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>]. Also, recent studies demonstrate a role for some KLKs during viral infections. For instance, KLK8 plays a role in the proteolytic activation of the human papillomavirus capsid protein, thereby mediating virus entry into host cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c76\" href=\"#r76\">76</a>]. Also, KLK5 and KLK12 are secreted into the respiratory tract, where they support replication of the influenza A virus by cleaving the hemagglutinin protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>]; however, these proteins belong to a large pool of cell surface proteases, the orchestrated action of which promotes virus replication.<br/><br/>Here, we found that the yield of HCoV-HKU1 from HAE fell in the presence of SPINK6<br/><br/>(inhibitor of KLK13) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>] and camostat (a broad range inhibitor of serine proteases).<br/><br/>However, the first compound also inhibits other KLKs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>], while the second block the activity of a wide range of serine proteases and was used previously to demonstrate the role of<br/><br/>TMPRSS2/4 proteases during viral infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c79\" href=\"#r79\">79</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>]. The relatively low inhibition of HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of SPINK6 possibly results from nonoptimal compound concentration at the HAE cultures, and cytotoxicity at higher concentrations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>]. Broad spectrum protease inhibitors are now used widely for virus research, although their non-specific activity makes the results equivocal. For example, Matsuyama et al.<br/><br/>showed recently that the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK interferes with the activity of several proteases, and that its previously described inhibitory activity during MERS-CoV infection is not specific to furin; instead, its activity is due to non-specific inhibition of cathepsin L and<br/><br/>TMPRSS2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>]. We tried to use specific KLK inhibitors developed in our laboratory [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>].<br/><br/>Considering the small arsenal of tools available to researchers studying KLKs, only three compounds were readily available. Treating HAE cultures with these inhibitors revealed that only compounds designed to inhibit KLK13 hampered HCoV-HKU1 replication. However, the great similarity between different KLKs makes one doubt the specificity of these inhibitors, despite their performance in biochemical assays. Therefore, we decided to silence KLK13 in<br/><br/>HAE cultures. This abolished virus replication ex vivo, thereby confirming the importance of<br/><br/>KLK13 during infection. KLK13 is thought to be secreted and membrane-bound[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>].<br/><br/>This study showed that HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE modulates the expression of different KLKs, including KLK13. In our study, KLKs expression was tested using semiquantitative PCR, and for that reason, we were unable to show the level of KLKs modulation after HCoV-HKU1. However, the pattern of virus-induced expression of several KLKs could be observed. KLK mechanism of activation is a complex process and until now it has only been proven that most KLK genes are regulated by steroids and other hormones [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>]. It is also important to remember, that KLK expression is regulated in a similar manner, and the induction of a single gene usually results in overexpression of the whole cluster [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>]. While one may assume that the virus stimulates KLK13 production to promote the infection, this up-regulation is likely a natural response of the damaged tissue, as KLKs were previously reported to take part also in tissue regeneration [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c87\" href=\"#r87\">87</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>]. Further, increased expression of KLKs may be the response to the inflammatory process, as Seliga et al demonstrated that KLK-kinin system is a potent modulator of innate immune responses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>].<br/><br/>The experiments performed herein show the importance of KLK13 for virus entry into susceptible cells; therefore, we speculated that scattered distribution of different KLKs in different tissues may be one of the determinants of the HCoV-HKU1 tropism [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>]. We tested the purified enzyme expressed in the eukaryotic cells; however, we also developed a cell line constitutively expressing the enzyme. As an in vitro model for our studies, we used RD cells previously reported to carry attachment receptors for the virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Here, using pseudoviruses decorated with S-HKU1 proteins we showed that KLK13 presence on RD cells is sufficient for virus entry and renders these cells permissive. Our experiments also showed that in contrast to previous reports, TMPRSS2 is not involved in this process[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. Furthermore, we observed that RD cells supported the replication of the virus in the presence of KLK13 and that this effect was reversed in the presence of the specific KLK13 inhibitor. We were, however, not able to culture the virus to high yields. HCoV-HKU1 replication in KLK13-expressing RD cells remained inefficient and RTqPCR assessment did not reveal significant increases in the amounts of viral RNA. For that reason, we are only able to detect viral sg mRNAs, which are considered to be the hallmark of coronaviral replication.We believe that this may be due to non-optimal infection conditions, which may include inappropriate KLK13 concentrations or low density of the entry receptor. Also, it is possible that RD cells may not support efficient replication of the virus due to factors unrelated to the entry process. Nonetheless, our results show that the HCoV-HKU1 entry receptor is present on RD cells, and we were able to trigger virus entry and replication; these findings warrant further exploration.<br/><br/>Most coronaviral S proteins are processed into S1 and S2 subunits by host proteases, which allows conformational changes in the S protein and leads to fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>]. As shown in the recent work by Kirchdoerfer et al, the<br/><br/>HCoV-HKU1 S protein has two regions that are prone to proteolytic activation: the S1/S2 furin cleavage site and a secondary cleavage site termed S2\u2019, which is adjacent to a potential fusion peptide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. While the S1/S2 site is believed to be processed by furin during protein biosynthesis, the S2/S2\u2019 site is expected to be cleaved during virus entry. As we already knew that KLK13 is sufficient for HCoV-HKU1 infection of naturally non-permissive RD cells, we aimed to investigate whether this was the direct result of KLK13-mediated proteolytic cleavage of the S protein. For this, we employed the CleavEx method, in which peptide of interest is coupled to the carrier HmuY protein and then undergoes proteolytic cleavage by the enzyme being tested. We found that the S1/S2 site was efficiently cleaved by KLK13, whereas the<br/><br/>S2/S2\u2019 region remained intact. As CleavEx technique is a convenient surrogate system allowing for precise mapping of the cleavage site, it has some limitations. To ensure the reliability of results, purified full-length HCoV-HKU1 S protein was subjected to the proteolytic cleavage.<br/><br/>Also here we observed efficient cleavage of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein by KLK13.<br/><br/>While the results presented here show that KLK13 is able to process the HCoV-HKU1<br/><br/>S protein, one may question whether the cleavage is sufficient for HCoV-HKU1 entry. It was previously presented for MERS-CoV that two consecutive enzymatic scissions are required for activation of the S protein. In this scenario, KLK13 would prime the HCoV-HKU1 S at S1-S2 site, enabling scission at S2-S2\u2019 site by the TMPRSS2 or another host protease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>].<br/><br/>This may be one of the factors limiting the HCoV-HKU1 replication in RD_KLK13 cells, as only minimal replication is observable.<br/><br/>Summarizing, we show that KLK13 is a key determinant of HCoV-HKU1 tropism. This may explain why, since its first identification in 2004, all efforts to culture HCoV-HKU1 in standard cell lines have failed. We believe that this study increases our knowledge of HCoV-<br/><br/>HKU1 and may promote the future in-depth investigation of coronaviruses. Considering the increasing number and diversity of coronaviruses, and the proven propensity of coronaviruses to cross the species barrier and cause severe diseases in humans, further research on the role of different proteases in coronaviral infections is necessary."

The signal was developed using the Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate (Thermo Scientific, Poland) and visualized using the ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Poland).<br/><br/>Expression and purification of KLK13 and KLK14<br/><br/>The proKLK13 gene was amplified using cDNA obtained from HAE cultures and specific primers. The codon-optimized proKLK14 gene was custom-synthesized (Thermo<br/><br/>Scientific, Poland). The products were cloned into the pLEXSY_I-blecherry3 plasmid (Jena<br/><br/>Bioscience, Germany) and the resulting constructs were verified by sequencing. All preparations for transfection, selection, and expression of the host Leishmania tarentolae strain<br/><br/>T7-TR were performed according to the Jena Bioscience protocol for inducible expression of recombinant proteins secreted to medium (LEXSinduce Expression kit, Jena Bioscience, Germany). Expression of proKLK13 and proKLK14 was induced with 15 \u03bcg/ml of tetracycline (BioShop, Canada) and carried out for 3 consecutive days. Culture media were collected and precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate, spun down at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Pellets were suspended in 10mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5 and dialyzed overnight at 4\u00b0C into 10mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5. The KLKs were isolated via the 6 \u00d7 His tag using nickel resin (GE<br/><br/>Healthcare, Poland) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Obtained fractions were analyzed by SDS PAGE in reducing conditions and fractions containing proKLK13 or proKLK14 were concentrated with Vivaspin\u00ae 2 (Sartorius, Germany) and further purified using size exclusion chromatography (Superdex s75 pg; GE Healthcare, Poland). Fractions containing proKLK13 or proKLK14 were concentrated and the buffer was changed to 50mM<br/><br/>Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. After purification and self-activation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, activity of proteases was assessed by serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 6 (SPINK6) titration, as described previously [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>].<br/><br/>Cloning of HmuY-based CleavEx fusion proteins<br/><br/>The fusion constructs were based on positions 26-216 of the Porphyromonas gingivalis<br/><br/>HmuY protein-encoding gene (accession number ABL74281.1), employed as a carrier protein.<br/><br/>The gene was amplified using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Poland) and specific primers (forward: 5\u2019\u2013 ATATGCGGCCGCAGACGAGCCGAACCAACCCTCCA \u2013<br/><br/>3\u2019 and reverse: 5\u2019 \u2013 ATACTCGAGTTATTTAACGGGGTATGTATAAGCGAAAGTGA \u2013<br/><br/>3\u2019) from whole-genomic DNA isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83. PCR conditions were as follows: 98\u00b0C for 30s, followed by denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 10s, annealing at 68\u00b0C for 40s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30s/kb over 35 cycles with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. Then, the HmuY gene was further amplified in the three consecutive PCR reactions with primers specific to the 5\u2019 HmuY fragment and 3\u2019-specific primer introducing additional nucleotides dependent on the designed sequence (proKLK13 primers, Table 4). The reaction was ligated into a modified pETDuet plasmid (potential tryptic cleavage sites were removed from the MCS) using Quick Change mutagenesis using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo<br/><br/>Scientific, Poland). Alternatively, the designed fusion protein-encoding sequences were produced using Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis (Thermo Scientific, Poland), via sequence exchange of the previously prepared CleavEx construct (HKU1-S primers, Table 4). The final product was transformed into competent E. coli T10 cells and further purified and sequenced.<br/><br/>Expression and purification of CleavEx fusion proteins<br/><br/>Protein expression was performed in E. coli BL21 and was induced by the addition of<br/><br/>0.5 mM IPTG to the bacterial culture (OD600 0.5-0.6), followed by shaking for 3h at 37\u00b0C.<br/><br/>Then, the bacteria were spun down and the pellet was suspended in buffer A (10 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). The pellet suspension was then sonicated and spun down. Soluble proteins were purified using HisTrapTM Excel (GE<br/><br/>Healthcare, Poland) column in buffer A with a linear gradient of 0-100% of 1 M imidazole in buffer A in 20 column volumes. Fractions containing protein of interest were pooled together and the buffer was exchanged to 50 mM Tris pH 7.5. Lastly, the protein of interest was purified by ion-exchange chromatography using MonoQ 4.6/100 PE column (GE Healthcare, Poland) with a linear gradient of 0-100% 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1M NaCl in 15 column volumes.<br/><br/>Expression and purification of the HCoV-HKU1 Spike protein<br/><br/>293T cells were seeded on 60 cm2 dishes, cultured for 24 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and transfected with 25 \u03bcg of pSecTag2-HKU-S plasmid per dish using polyethyleneimine (Sigma<br/><br/>Aldrich, Poland). Cells were further cultured for 72 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and collected for<br/><br/>HKU1-S purification. Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) in the presence of Viscolase (1250 U/ml; A&A Biotechnology, Poland), clarified by centrifugation, and filtered (0.45 \u03bcm syringe PES filter). Supernatant containing 6 \u00d7 His tagged S protein was mixed in 1:2 ratio with binding buffer (20 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH = 7.4) and purified using a fast performance liquid chromatography system (FPLC; AKTA, GE Healthcare, Poland) with a Ni2+ HiTrap IMAC (2 \u00d7 1 ml) column (GE Healthcare, Poland) preequilibrated with the binding buffer. The 6 \u00d7 His tagged S protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM<br/><br/>NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH = 6.9). The control sample from mocktransfected cells was prepared in the same manner. Fractions containing 6 \u00d7 His tagged<br/><br/>S protein or the respective fractions from control purification were pooled and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 5% glycerol.<br/><br/>CleavEx screening assay and HKU1-S cleavage<br/><br/>A total of 15 ng of each CleavEx protein was incubated with 50, 250 and 500 nM<br/><br/>KLK13, respectively in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5. For the full-length Spike protein, fractions containing purified HKU1-S or mock samples were incubated with 0.5, 1.0 or 5.0 \u03bcM KLK13, respectively in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5. Samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours and immediately halted with the addition of 50 mM DTT-supplemented SDS sample buffer (1:1), boiled for 5 min, cooled on ice, and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels alongside dual-color<br/><br/>Page Ruler Prestained Protein size markers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland). The separated proteins were then transferred onto a Westran S PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare, Poland) by wet blotting (Bio-Rad, Poland) for 1 h, 100 Volts in transfer buffer: 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were then blocked by overnight incubation (at<br/><br/>4\u00b0C) in TBS-Tween (0.1%) buffer supplemented with 5% skimmed milk (BioShop, Canada).<br/><br/>A horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-His tag antibody (1:25000 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland) diluted in 5% skimmed milk / TBS-Tween (0.1%) was used to detect the His-tagged<br/><br/>HmuY proteins.

Next, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 mM DTT-supplemented SDS sample buffer (1:1) and samples were immediately boiled for 5 min. The samples were then separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel alongside the dual-color Page Ruler Prestained Protein size markers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland) in the Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE system. The separated proteins were then electrotransferred onto a Western S PVDF membrane (GE<br/><br/>Healthcare, Poland) using the Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, Poland). The transfer was performed for 30 min at 15 V in transfer buffer (10 mM N-cyclohexyl-3-<br/><br/>aminopropanesulfonic acid , 10% methanol, pH 11). Following the transfer, the membrane was stained with 0.025% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (BioShop, Poland) and the bands of interest were sequenced via Edman degradation using a PPSQ-31A automatic protein sequencer (Shimadzu, Japan)."

        "ABSTRACT": [
            "Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is associated with respiratory disease and is prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. Interaction between the coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells.",
            "We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, proving that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and may help to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential."

        "INTRODUCTION": [
            "Coronaviruses are the largest group within the order Nidovirales. Mainly, they cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals, but some can cause more serious conditions such as hepatitis, peritonitis, or neurological disease. Seven coronaviruses infect humans, four of which (human coronavirus [HCoV]-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and",
            "HCoV-HKU1) cause relatively mild upper and lower respiratory tract disease and two (SARS-",
            "CoV and MERS-CoV) are associated with severe, life-threatening respiratory infections and multiorgan failure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Furthermore, in December 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Hubei province, China, causing pneumonia. To date, almost 90,000 cases were identified and 3,000 patients died worldwide.",
            "Coronaviral infection is initiated by interaction between the trimeric spike (S) protein and its receptor, which is expressed on the surface of the susceptible cell. A number of adhesion and entry receptors have been described for coronaviruses. For example, HCoV-229E (similar to many other alphacoronaviruses) utilizes aminopeptidase N (APN) as the primary entry port [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Surprisingly, its cousin HCoV-NL63 shares receptor specificity with the evolutionarily distant SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: all hijack angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (8-",
            "11). HCoV-NL63 was also shown to use heparan sulfate as a primary attachment site [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "A very different receptor is recognized by MERS-CoV, which binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4",
            "acetylneuraminic acid [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. HCoV-HKU1 remains the great unknown because its cellular receptor has not been identified and all efforts to culture the virus in vitro have failed.",
            "HCoV-HKU1 was identified in Hong Kong in 2004. The virus was present in a sample obtained from an elderly patient with severe pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Epidemiological studies show a high prevalence of the pathogen in humans; this is because the majority of children seroconvert before the age of 6 years [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. While it is not possible to culture HCoV-HKU1 in vitro, we and others reported that ex vivo fully differentiated human airway epithelium (HAE) and human alveolar type II cells support the infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. A thorough study by Huang X et al.",
            "demonstrated that HCoV-HKU1 binds to target cells via O-acetylated sialic acids on the cell surface; however, this interaction is not sufficient for the infection. The study also showed that the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of HCoV-HKU1 exhibits sialate-O-acetylesterase activity and may act as a receptor-destroying enzyme, thereby facilitating the release of viral progeny [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Bakkers et al proposed that, in order to adapt to the sialoglycome of the human respiratory tract over the evolutionary timescale, HCoV-HKU1 lost the ability to bind to attachment receptors via the HE protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Recently, Hulswit et al mapped the virus binding site to O-acetylated sialic acids, demonstrating that the S1 domain A is responsible for binding to the attachment receptor [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>].",
            "The S protein is the main player during coronavirus entry, and its characteristics determine the host range. Coronaviral S proteins are class I fusion proteins comprising a large",
            "N-terminal ectodomain, a hydrophobic trans-membrane region, and a small C-terminal endodomain. The ectodomain is highly glycosylated and is composed of S1 and S2 domains.",
            "The globular S1 domain is highly variable and carries the receptor-binding site, whereas the more conserved rod-like S2 domain undergoes structural rearrangement during entry, which brings the cellular and viral membranes into close proximity. Such a structural switch may be triggered by different stimuli, including receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage of the S protein, and/or a reduction in pH. Because different species require different stimuli, coronaviruses enter cells at different subcellular sites. Some coronaviruses fuse at the plasma membrane, whereas others are believed to enter the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by fusion deep within the endosomal compartments [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Furthermore, recent reports show that the entry portal may vary depending on tissue/cell characteristics. These differences may affect the host range, pathogenicity, and cell/tissue specificity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].",
            "Host proteases prime coronaviral S proteins. For example, trypsin-mediated cleavage in the small intestine is required for entry of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>], while a number of coronaviruses from different genera (including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, murine hepatitis virus [MHV], MERS-CoV, and infectious bronchitis virus [IBV]) possess a furin cleavage site [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. Kam et al showed that SARS-CoV S protein can be cleaved by plasmin; however, there is almost no biological evidence for its role in vivo [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. Cathepsins may also act as S protein-activating enzymes. Indeed, cathepsin L processes the S proteins of SARS-",

However, recent reports show that, in vivo, respiratory coronaviruses may be activated by the TMPRSS2 protease, which enables endocytosis-independent internalization, thereby re-shaping the entry process [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>].",
            "While laboratory strains require priming by cathepsins, S proteins of clinical isolates (e.g., HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) undergo TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage at the cell surface, which enables them to fuse with the cell membrane on the cell surface [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. A recent study by",
            "Shirato et al demonstrates that coronaviruses may lose their ability to infect naturally permissive HAE cultures during cell culture adaptation because the S gene evolves and adjusts to the proteolytic landscape of the immortalized cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>].",
            "Here, we identified a protease belonging to the tissue kallikrein (KLK) family as a new player essential for HCoV-HKU1 entry to the target cell. The KLK family comprises 15 closely related serine proteases with trypsin- or chymotrypsin-like specificity. The expression of these enzymes is tightly regulated, and each tissue has its own unique KLK expression profile. These enzymes play a role in a diverse range of processes during embryonic development to adulthood [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>], and some have been linked to human cancers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>]. The function of some KLKs remains to be elucidated, but obtained results suggest that protease distribution may be an important factor pre-determining the cell and tissue specificity of the virus, but also regulating the interspecies transfers.",
            "Further, the data presented herein bring us a step closer to developing a convenient in vitro culture model and possibly identifying the cellular receptor for this virus. It is also of importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses and may help to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential."

We detected the expression of KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11, and KLK13 in non-infected fully differentiated cultures. However, the pattern in HCoV-HKU1-infected cells was different: we detected an upregulation of KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11 and KLK13.",

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "Receptor recognition is the first, essential step of the virus infection process. The coronaviral S protein mediates virus entry into host cells by binding to a specific receptor. A combination of stimuli, e.g., receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage, and exposure to low pH results in rearrangement of the S protein and, consequently, to membrane fusion and virus entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Although the structure of both the HCoV-HKU1 S ectodomain and the receptor-binding domain has been resolved, the receptor determinant remains unknown [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>]. In a previous study, we showed that HCoV-HKU1 utilizes O-acetylated sialic acids on host cells as an attachment receptor [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Here, we present data demonstrating that the protease KLK13 is required for HCoV-HKU1 infection of the respiratory epithelium.",
            "Human KLKs take part in multiple physiological processes, including skin desquamation, tooth enamel formation, kidney and brain function, and synaptic neural plasticity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>]. Also, recent studies demonstrate a role for some KLKs during viral infections. For instance, KLK8 plays a role in the proteolytic activation of the human papillomavirus capsid protein, thereby mediating virus entry into host cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c76\" href=\"#r76\">76</a>]. Also, KLK5 and KLK12 are secreted into the respiratory tract, where they support replication of the influenza A virus by cleaving the hemagglutinin protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>]; however, these proteins belong to a large pool of cell surface proteases, the orchestrated action of which promotes virus replication.",
            "Here, we found that the yield of HCoV-HKU1 from HAE fell in the presence of SPINK6",
            "(inhibitor of KLK13) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>] and camostat (a broad range inhibitor of serine proteases).",
            "However, the first compound also inhibits other KLKs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>], while the second block the activity of a wide range of serine proteases and was used previously to demonstrate the role of",
            "TMPRSS2/4 proteases during viral infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c79\" href=\"#r79\">79</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>]. The relatively low inhibition of HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of SPINK6 possibly results from nonoptimal compound concentration at the HAE cultures, and cytotoxicity at higher concentrations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>]. Broad spectrum protease inhibitors are now used widely for virus research, although their non-specific activity makes the results equivocal. For example, Matsuyama et al.",
            "showed recently that the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK interferes with the activity of several proteases, and that its previously described inhibitory activity during MERS-CoV infection is not specific to furin; instead, its activity is due to non-specific inhibition of cathepsin L and",
            "TMPRSS2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>]. We tried to use specific KLK inhibitors developed in our laboratory [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>].",
            "Considering the small arsenal of tools available to researchers studying KLKs, only three compounds were readily available. Treating HAE cultures with these inhibitors revealed that only compounds designed to inhibit KLK13 hampered HCoV-HKU1 replication. However, the great similarity between different KLKs makes one doubt the specificity of these inhibitors, despite their performance in biochemical assays. Therefore, we decided to silence KLK13 in",
            "HAE cultures. This abolished virus replication ex vivo, thereby confirming the importance of",
            "KLK13 during infection. KLK13 is thought to be secreted and membrane-bound[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>].",
            "This study showed that HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE modulates the expression of different KLKs, including KLK13. In our study, KLKs expression was tested using semiquantitative PCR, and for that reason, we were unable to show the level of KLKs modulation after HCoV-HKU1. However, the pattern of virus-induced expression of several KLKs could be observed. KLK mechanism of activation is a complex process and until now it has only been proven that most KLK genes are regulated by steroids and other hormones [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>]. It is also important to remember, that KLK expression is regulated in a similar manner, and the induction of a single gene usually results in overexpression of the whole cluster [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>]. While one may assume that the virus stimulates KLK13 production to promote the infection, this up-regulation is likely a natural response of the damaged tissue, as KLKs were previously reported to take part also in tissue regeneration [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c87\" href=\"#r87\">87</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>]. Further, increased expression of KLKs may be the response to the inflammatory process, as Seliga et al demonstrated that KLK-kinin system is a potent modulator of innate immune responses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>].",
            "The experiments performed herein show the importance of KLK13 for virus entry into susceptible cells; therefore, we speculated that scattered distribution of different KLKs in different tissues may be one of the determinants of the HCoV-HKU1 tropism [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>]. We tested the purified enzyme expressed in the eukaryotic cells; however, we also developed a cell line constitutively expressing the enzyme. As an in vitro model for our studies, we used RD cells previously reported to carry attachment receptors for the virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Here, using pseudoviruses decorated with S-HKU1 proteins we showed that KLK13 presence on RD cells is sufficient for virus entry and renders these cells permissive. Our experiments also showed that in contrast to previous reports, TMPRSS2 is not involved in this process[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. Furthermore, we observed that RD cells supported the replication of the virus in the presence of KLK13 and that this effect was reversed in the presence of the specific KLK13 inhibitor. We were, however, not able to culture the virus to high yields. HCoV-HKU1 replication in KLK13-expressing RD cells remained inefficient and RTqPCR assessment did not reveal significant increases in the amounts of viral RNA. For that reason, we are only able to detect viral sg mRNAs, which are considered to be the hallmark of coronaviral replication.We believe that this may be due to non-optimal infection conditions, which may include inappropriate KLK13 concentrations or low density of the entry receptor. Also, it is possible that RD cells may not support efficient replication of the virus due to factors unrelated to the entry process. Nonetheless, our results show that the HCoV-HKU1 entry receptor is present on RD cells, and we were able to trigger virus entry and replication; these findings warrant further exploration.",
            "Most coronaviral S proteins are processed into S1 and S2 subunits by host proteases, which allows conformational changes in the S protein and leads to fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>]. As shown in the recent work by Kirchdoerfer et al, the",
            "HCoV-HKU1 S protein has two regions that are prone to proteolytic activation: the S1/S2 furin cleavage site and a secondary cleavage site termed S2\u2019, which is adjacent to a potential fusion peptide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. While the S1/S2 site is believed to be processed by furin during protein biosynthesis, the S2/S2\u2019 site is expected to be cleaved during virus entry. As we already knew that KLK13 is sufficient for HCoV-HKU1 infection of naturally non-permissive RD cells, we aimed to investigate whether this was the direct result of KLK13-mediated proteolytic cleavage of the S protein. For this, we employed the CleavEx method, in which peptide of interest is coupled to the carrier HmuY protein and then undergoes proteolytic cleavage by the enzyme being tested. We found that the S1/S2 site was efficiently cleaved by KLK13, whereas the",
            "S2/S2\u2019 region remained intact. As CleavEx technique is a convenient surrogate system allowing for precise mapping of the cleavage site, it has some limitations. To ensure the reliability of results, purified full-length HCoV-HKU1 S protein was subjected to the proteolytic cleavage.",

            "S protein, one may question whether the cleavage is sufficient for HCoV-HKU1 entry. It was previously presented for MERS-CoV that two consecutive enzymatic scissions are required for activation of the S protein. In this scenario, KLK13 would prime the HCoV-HKU1 S at S1-S2 site, enabling scission at S2-S2\u2019 site by the TMPRSS2 or another host protease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>].",

            "The authors infected RD_ctrl and RD_KLK13 cells with HCoV-HKU1 (108 RNA copies per ml) and incubated the culture for 7 days at 32\u00b0C in the presence or absence of a KLK13 inhibitor (10 \u03bcM) or DMSO.",

        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Receptor recognition is the first, essential step of the virus infection process. The coronaviral S protein mediates virus entry into host cells by binding to a specific receptor.",
            "As the authors already knew that KLK13 is sufficient for HCoV-HKU1 infection of naturally non-permissive RD cells, the authors aimed to investigate whether this was the direct result of KLK13-mediated proteolytic cleavage of the S protein.",
            "It was previously presented for MERS-CoV that two consecutive enzymatic scissions are required for activation of the S protein",
            "In this scenario, KLK13 would prime the HCoV-HKU1 S at S1-S2 site, enabling scission at S2-S2\u2019 site by the TMPRSS2 or another host protease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>].",
            "Considering the increasing number and diversity of coronaviruses, and the proven propensity of coronaviruses to cross the species barrier and cause severe diseases in humans, further research on the role of different proteases in coronaviral infections is necessary"
