Our result shows that the basic reproductive number of virus in host growth is around 3.79. The PRCC method is used to analyze the sensitivities of model parameters and the drug effects on virus growth are also implemented to analyze the model.",

            "At the end of 2019, a new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, began to threaten the people in China, especially in Hubei province. As of Feb.24, 2020, 77780 individuals have been confirmed to be infected by this virus in China, including 2666 deaths. To mitigate the spread of the virus, the Chinese Government has progressively implemented metropolitan-wide quarantine in Wuhan and several nearby cities from Jan 23\u201324, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. The virus has also spread to several other countries, such as the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Italy, and new deaths are reported every day.<br/><br/>Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in COVID19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], which is the name of that new coronavirus caused disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Before Feb.13, the new cases in China were confirmed by nucleic acid testing. After that day, the diagnostic criterion has been improved, composed of not only the nucleic acid testing but also the CT test. The destructed pulmonary parenchyma and the resulting inflammation can be reflected from the chest radiograph [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Chest radiograph score method is a useful way to quantify the destruction of pulmonary parenchyma and in this study, our data set is based on this.<br/><br/>Several works are [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] nowcasting and forecasting the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Meanwhile, some works [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] overview the characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of confirmed cases. All of these works focus on population dynamics of COVID-19, while, the works about the viral dynamics in host are rare. In this work, we use the within-host viral dynamic model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] to describe the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in host and the parameters of that model are estimated via the chest radiograph score. All of the results are shown in the third section."

            "We use the following ordinary differential equation model to simulate the SARSCoV-2 within-host growth: dEp (t) dt    =    dE    Ep(0) \u2212 Ep(t)<br/><br/>\u2212 \u03b2Ep(t)v(t), dEp\u2217    \u03b2Ep(t)v(t)    \u2212    dE\u2217 Ep\u2217(t),    (1)<br/><br/>dv(t) dt \u03c0v Ep\u2217 (t) dv v(t), where Ep(t), Ep\u2217(t) and v(t) are the number of uninfected pulmonary epithelial cells, infected pulmonary epithelial cells and the virus. \u03b2 is the infection rate of virus, \u03c0v is the virus production rate, Ep(0) is the initial value of uninfected epithelial cells, and the term dEEp(0) assumes a constant regeneration of uninfected epithelial cells. dE, dE\u2217 and dv are the death rate of uninfected pulmonary epithelial cells, infected pulmonary epithelial cells and the virus, respectively. The death rate of Ep(t) is the natural clearance rate of pulmonary epithelial cells, while, dE\u2217 and dv are the combination of the natural clearance rate and elimination by the immunity system. This model was also used to describe the within-lung infection process of flu virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].<br/><br/>By the definition of generation matrix of basic reproduction number R0 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], the R0 of model (1) can be written as, R0<br/><br/>\u03b2\u03c0vEp(0) . dE\u2217 dv (2)<br/><br/>This number is an important value to measure whether the epidemic or species could die out or not [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. In this study, the sensitivity analysis result of R0 is shown in the next section.<br/><br/>In this study, the chest radiograph score data from serve patients (with high chest radiograph scores) are collected from the work [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] and our estimation is based on this data set. We consider the chest radiograph score as a way to reflect the infected pulmonary epithelial cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], which is also the target attacked by the immune cell [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Thus by the Poisson distribution, the likelihood that used to extimate parameters can be written as, L=<br/><br/>Di log Ep\u2217(ti) \u2212 Ep\u2217(ti) \u2212 log \u0393(Di + 1) ,    (3)<br/><br/>i where Di is the smoothed chest radiograph score of the serve patient at time ti, Ep\u2217(ti) is the solution of Ep\u2217(t) at time ti, and log \u0393(x) is log-gamma function, respectively. The prior distributions of the parameters of model (1) are based on the previous works [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]."

We estimate that the death rate of the virus is 5.36 per day, which is larger than the clearance rate of the virus on the outside surface [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. This result shows the immune system can clear the virus directly. The estimation result also shows that the R0 of virus in serve patients is around the mean value 3.79, which illustrates that the immune system can not clear the virus effectively at the beginning time of symptom onset.

            "At the end of 2019, a new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, began to threaten the people in China, especially in Hubei province. As of Feb.24, 2020, 77780 individuals have been confirmed to be infected by this virus in China, including 2666 deaths. To mitigate the spread of the virus, the Chinese Government has progressively implemented metropolitan-wide quarantine in Wuhan and several nearby cities from Jan 23\u201324, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. The virus has also spread to several other countries, such as the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Italy, and new deaths are reported every day.",
            "Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in COVID19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], which is the name of that new coronavirus caused disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Before Feb.13, the new cases in China were confirmed by nucleic acid testing. After that day, the diagnostic criterion has been improved, composed of not only the nucleic acid testing but also the CT test. The destructed pulmonary parenchyma and the resulting inflammation can be reflected from the chest radiograph [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Chest radiograph score method is a useful way to quantify the destruction of pulmonary parenchyma and in this study, our data set is based on this.",

Meanwhile, some works [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] overview the characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of confirmed cases. All of these works focus on population dynamics of COVID-19, while, the works about the viral dynamics in host are rare. In this work, we use the within-host viral dynamic model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] to describe the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in host and the parameters of that model are estimated via the chest radiograph score. All of the results are shown in the third section."

The death rate of Ep(t) is the natural clearance rate of pulmonary epithelial cells, while, dE\u2217 and dv are the combination of the natural clearance rate and elimination by the immunity system. This model was also used to describe the within-lung infection process of flu virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].",
