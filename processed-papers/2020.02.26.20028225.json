Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2."

            "From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients.",
            "Study design and patients In this study, we recruited 35 female COVID-19 patients from January 28 to February 18, 2020 in three branches of Tongji Hospital, Sino-French New City Branch (16 cases), Optical Valley Branch (16 cases) and Hankou main campus (3 cases) respectively, which are located in different geographical areas of Wuhan.

Twenty-seven patients with COVID-19 were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-PCR analysis on samples from the respiratory tract, and eight patients were diagnosed as clinically confirmed cases based on the 5th guidance mentioned above according to epidemiological history, symptoms and chest CT. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (TJ-IRB20200208).

We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients\u2019 sexual partner was 42\u00b79%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient)."

In addition, asymptomatic infected persons are potential sources of infection, with the long incubation period, increasing the difficulty in epidemic prevention and control[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Therefore, the transmission of SARSCoV-2 is still worth exploring."

            "Our study has several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small in which only 35 patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive or CT suspected was included; much more patients including sexually active women are needed to confirm our findings in the future. Second, samples from partner of the patients enrolled is missing, including anal swabs, semen, and urethral orifice swabs. Nevertheless, the data in our study revealed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of female patients with COVID-19 in a new prospective. In summary, though no evidence was found in this study that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by vaginal sex from female to the partner. Considering the complexity of sexual behavior and the transmission potential of asymptomatic infectives, we suggest that people who lived in the epidemic areas, have tourism history from epidemic areas and were potentially asymptomatic infected should be very cautious about sex behavior and avoid oral/anal sex especially, which may be helpful to prevent further spreading of SARS-CoV-2."

SARS-CoV-2 is so widely spread, leading to injury of multiple organs and deaths. Therefore, it is crucially important to identify the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in order to prevent its further spreading.",
            "Previously in 2003, there was an outbreak of SARS-CoV in China 5. The main transmission route of SARS-CoV was via respiratory droplets, although the potential of transmission by opportunistic airborne routes and environmental factors was also reported 6,7. In addition, SARS-CoV was detected in urine, feces and tears of some SARS-CoV infected patients. It was confirmed that SARS-CoV could be transmitted through fecal-oral and contiguous pathways 6,8. Thus far, there has not been a report to show if SARS-CoV can be transmitted through sexual transmission. Therefore, based on the transmission route of SARS-CoV, current preventive measures, including maintaining good personal and environmental health, and implementing strict contact and droplet prevention measures in the community, can effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV6. However, different from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, another virus of the same coronavirus family, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later spread to several other countries[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], was transmitted through large droplets and close contact, although the possibility of air transmission or dust mite transmission was not ruled out[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Also, it is not clear whether MERS-CoV is sexually transmitted. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided recommendations for the prevention of MERS-CoV, mainly including droplet and contact precautions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Interestingly, HCoV-229E in the coronavirus family was detected in the maternal vagina and also found in the gastric swab samples of newborns 12. This makes the sexual transmission of this type of virus possible although there is no direct evidence to prove it. Therefore, it also remains possible that SARS-CoV-2, as a new type of coronavirus, could be sexually transmitted.",
            "Currently, the main known transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory air droplets. The other routes could be through secretary liquids, such as from eyes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. SARS-CoV-2 was shown to exist in the feces of patients with COVID19, suggesting that fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible 15. Although there is currently no evidence for vertical transmission 16, it still remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 has other transmission routes from person to person. To explore the possibility of sexual transmission of this contagious virus, we performed RT-PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in the anal swab samples and vaginal environment samples (including cervical or vaginal residue exfoliated cells, vaginal discharge) collected from 35 female patients with COVID-19 and inquired their recent sexual behavior."

        "Results": [
            "35 patients with COVID-19 were recruited in this study, the range of their age was 37-88, with a mean age of 61\u00b75 years (SD =11\u00b72; Table 1). Most patients were natives of Wuhan (n =29, 82.9%), and only one had directly contacted with Huanan seafood market. The most common chronic medical diseases were hypertension (n =12, 34.3%) and diabetes (n =7, 20%). As for gynecological diseases, uterine fibroids were mentioned the most (n =13, 37\u00b71%). Other diseases included cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III, endometrial atypical hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer, with one patient for each disease. Most patients had entered menopause (n =28, 80%). For the rest 7 patients, except for 1 puerperal woman who had a cesarean section 2 days before with breast milk and neonatal throat swab SARS-CoV-2 negative, the remaining 6 patients still had menstruation, in which half of them complained of decreased menstrual flow.",
            "The most common first symptom was fever (n =25, 71\u00b74%), Due to the special diagnostic principles in Wuhan; only 27 (77\u00b71%) patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Throat swab). The remaining 8 patients were clinically diagnosed depend on the images of CT scan (Table[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]). All patients in this study were classified at admission, including mild group (n =1, 2\u00b79%), severe group (n =32, 91\u00b74%) and critical group (n =2, 5\u00b77%, Table 2). After admission, the white blood cell count was decreased in 5 (14\u00b73%) patients and increased in 4 patients (11\u00b74%, Table 3). 16 (45\u00b77%) patients had a lymphocyte count reduction, while 18 patients (51.4%) had a lymphocyte ratio below the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level was increased in 14 (40%) patients. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate accelerated in 19 (54\u00b73%) patients. 10 (28.6%) patients had increased aspartate transaminase (AST), and 13 (37\u00b71%) patients had elevated alanine transaminase (ALT). The serum potassium was decreased in 5 patients (14\u00b73%) and increased in 3 patients (8\u00b76%).",
            "Five (14\u00b73%) patients had decreased serum sodium. 28 of the 35 patients were tested for multiple cytokines, including Interleukin1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), Interleukin2R (IL-2R), Interleukin[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] (IL-6), Interleukin[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] (IL-8), Interleukin 10 (IL-10) and Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). IL-2R, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 were higher than the normal range in half or more patients, respectively. Notably, 9 (32\u00b71%) patients\u2019 level of IL-2R, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 increased altogether. Every patient showed typical findings of chest CT images-multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in lungs. Typical images from each group were demonstrated (Figure 1).",
            "Most patients received antiviral and antibiotic treatment (n =33, 94\u00b73% and n =29, 82\u00b79% respectively), 13 (37\u00b71%) patients received glucocorticoids (Table 2). 9 (25\u00b77%) patients received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Three (8\u00b76%) patients received anticoagulant therapy. Oxygen therapy was used for every patient. Most of the patients received oxygen by mask or nasal catheter. Only 2 (5\u00b77%) patients received non-invasive ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and they were free of BiPAP on the day we collected the samples. No patient received Invasive ventilation (Table 2). By the end of Feb 22, 1 (2\u00b79%) patient had been discharged, and all other patients were still in the hospital (Table 1).",
            "The infection rate for the 35 female patents\u2019 sexual partner was up to 42\u00b79%, but only 2 patients, Patient 14 and 19, admitted having sexual behavior with their partners from 14 days before the onset of first symptoms to the day we collected samples (Table 1, Table 4, Figure 2). The detailed timelines are exhibited (Figure 2). Both patients use intrauterine device for contraception. Patient 14 was 48 years old. She had regular sex behavior during the 14 days before first symptom (Figure 2). While stopped since she suffered from fever with a highest temperature above 39\u00b70\u00b0C. Patient 19 was 41 years old. Her duration of sex behavior was longer than patient 14, which ended at the day she was diagnosed by throat swab. Her first symptom was also fever, but the highest temperature (38\u00b79\u00b0C) is lower than patient 14 and her symptoms were mild in need of lower flow of oxygen (Figure 2). Patient 19\u2019s partner was clinical diagnosed with COVID-19, while patient 14\u2019s was not.",
            "Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted using the vaginal environment and anal swab samples of 35 female patients with COVID-19. All the vaginal environment samples (35 cases in total) were negative. One anal swab sample (35 cases in total) was positive (Table 4), which was from a 64-year-old female of Wuhan, who had entered menopause for 10 years. Her husband was also diagnosed with COVID-19, while they had no sexual behavior from 14 days before the first of symptoms to the day samples collected."
        ],
        "DISCUSSION": [
            "The evidence so far suggests that respiratory droplets and intimate contact are the two main transmission routes of SARS-CoV-219-22. Aerosol transmission also exists in relatively closed unventilated space[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Fecal-oral transmission is possible[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Vertical transmission have not been verified[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>], although scientists have found that SARSCoV-2 is positive in feces and blood[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], while negative in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. In addition, asymptomatic infected persons are potential sources of infection, with the long incubation period, increasing the difficulty in epidemic prevention and control[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Therefore, the transmission of SARSCoV-2 is still worth exploring.",
            "Herein, we reported a cohort of 35 female patients, with an age range of 37-88. Additionally, over 54\u00b73% (19/35) patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases including cancer (Table 1), are more susceptible due to the weaker immune function[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], in accordance with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV5. There was a special patient undergoing caesarean section due to scar uterus contractions. We obtained the vaginal secretions on the third day after operation and found the SARS-CoV-2 negative similar to breastmilk, anal swab and neonatal throat swab samples. Up to now, no evidence suggested that pregnant women need caesarean section merely because of SARS-CoV-2 positive in mother\u2019s throat swab[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>].",
            "Our study showed that female patients with COVID-19 have a similar trait of clinical characteristics to the patients reported recently. Most common first symptom was fever (25, 71\u00b74%). Lymphopenia was a common phenomenon, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might primarily target lymphocytes, like SARS-CoV5. IL-2R, IL6, and TNF-\u03b1 were above the normal range in half patients. A cytokine storm was induced after SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by large amounts of immune responses and changes in immune cells such as lymphocytes, which was same as people infected SARS-CoV5,26. Oxygen therapy was used for every patient to improve hypoxia. Most patients received antiviral treatment and antibiotic treatment to inhibit virus replication and prevent bacterial co-infection. Glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin therapy used in some patients is in order to inhibit inflammatory response based on \u201ccytokine storm\u201d theory. However, some researchers suggested that the use of antibiotics and glucocorticoids are not good for patients due to lacking strong evidence[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].",
            "Sex behavior is a cluster of intimate contacts involving hugs, kisses, and oral/anal sex, et al Researchers have found SARS-CoV-2 positive in throat swab, droplet, anal swab, saliva, urine, and tear samples[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>], whether female vaginal environment contains SARS-CoV-2 triggered our interest. We collected 105 samples from 35 patients to detect the SARS-CoV-2, including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residue exfoliated cells and anal swap, It is worth noting that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2, which is in consistence with the possibility of fecal-oral transmission reported previously 23. The unexpected results from the vaginal environment may due to the negative expression of ACE2, the receptor of SARS-Cov-2, in the vagina and cervix[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>].",
            "Additionally, for two female patients admitted having sexual behaviors in the possible incubation period with their partners, one patient\u2019s partner was diagnosed with COVID-19. We cannot conclude that the infected partner is transmitted by her through sex behavior, as the samples of her vaginal environment anal swab samples were all SARS-CoV-2 free. But we should consider sex behavior as a cluster of intimate contacts involving hugs, kisses, and oral/anal sex, et al She might transfer the virus to him by these intimate contacts, or the other way around. It is worth noting the infection rate for the 35 female patents\u2019 sexual partner was up to 42\u00b79%, which is not a low proportion. Given to the fact that females are shy to talk about sex in China, it was probably many patients had hidden their sex history. So, sex partners got infected by the intimate contacts during sex might be more than one in the 42\u00b79% group. If one of the involvers in a sex behavior is in incubation period or is asymptomatic patient, the risk of the other involver got infected is pretty high. As asymptomatic persons are potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>].",
            "Transmission between family members occurred in 13-21% of MERS cases and 22-39% of SARS cases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Moreover, many patients with SARS or MERS were infected through super-spreaders 5. Investigators had reported that the main route of",
            "SARS-CoV transmission was via respiratory droplets, and may also be transmitted through fecal-oral and contiguous pathways[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Unlike SARS-CoV, the main transmission route of MERS-CoV was large droplets and contact. It is still not clear whether SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV is transmitted through sexual transmission. Based on the transmission route of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, preventive measures, including maintaining good personal and environmental health, and implementing strict contact and droplet prevention measures in the community, can effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In this study, no evidence indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could transmit by vaginal sex from female to her partner. But the risk of infection by oral/anal sex or other intimate contacts during sex should not be ignored. We suggest that people in the affected areas should be very cautious about sex behavior, avoid oral/anal sex especially. It might be helpful to reduce the global spreading of SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Our study has several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small in which only 35 patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive or CT suspected was included; much more patients including sexually active women are needed to confirm our findings in the future. Second, samples from partner of the patients enrolled is missing, including anal swabs, semen, and urethral orifice swabs. Nevertheless, the data in our study revealed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of female patients with COVID-19 in a new prospective. In summary, though no evidence was found in this study that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by vaginal sex from female to the partner. Considering the complexity of sexual behavior and the transmission potential of asymptomatic infectives, we suggest that people who lived in the epidemic areas, have tourism history from epidemic areas and were potentially asymptomatic infected should be very cautious about sex behavior and avoid oral/anal sex especially, which may be helpful to prevent further spreading of SARS-CoV-2.",
