        "abstract": "Objective: This paper studied the relationship between personality traits and mental health conditions of medical personnel to provide a basis and reference for the implementation of targeted education on mental health. Methods: A self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China. Results: The overall mean SCL-90 score and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group (p < 0.05), while their average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower (p < 0.01). In addition, personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified. ( all p < 0.05). Conclusion: The overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new coronavirus pneumonia is generally higher than that of the norm group in China. The results of this study should contribute to measures to alleviate the psychological pressures on medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus epidemic in China.

            "3.1 Comparison of SCL-90 factor scores between medical personnel and the national norm group<br/><br/>COVID-19 is a fulminant infectious disease. As it is highly contagious, many people are frightened by it and even talk fearfully about coronavirus, which can also be observed in front-line medical staff. The results of the study have shown that the overall mean of the SCL-90 and the mean values of the factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of medical personnel were significantly higher than that of the norm group (p < 0.05), while the average score of the interpersonal sensitivity factor of medical personnel was significantly lower than that of the norm group (p < 0.01). More specifically, medical personnel are most of the people closest to COVID-19 patients, so they are at high risk of exposure to the disease. Moreover, they have a deep understanding of the dangers of COVID-19, so they are prone to anxiety and fear. The infection protection procedures for COVID-19 are highly complex and medical staff need to constantly change clothes and replace protective equipment, so they are more likely to establish obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Medical personnel, especially young medical staff, have less experience in the field and in dealing with difficulties and hardships in life. Therefore, when they suddenly encounter such sudden public health events, they tend to suffer anxiety and phobic anxiety, leading to physical and mental problems. That is why scores of the factors somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism were significantly higher than in the norm group. This result suggests that psychologists and team leaders should pay more attention to the anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism issues of the medical personnel in a team. The average score for the interpersonal sensitivity factor of medical personnel was significantly lower than that of the norm group. This shows that in the event of an infectious disease epidemic, the majority of medical personnel are united and have good professional strengths and qualities for self-regulation and self-protection. The results of this study show partial consistency with the studies of the mental health status of front-line medical personnel for SARS in 2003 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. 3.2 Analysis of influencing factors of the mental health status of medical personnel<br/><br/>The results of this study have shown that the factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel based on the significance from high to low are: the degree of suspicion that they were infected when the novel coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, the level of concern whether they and their family members have been infected, age, whether they have supported in affected areas in Hubei Province, designated hospitals, and other places for the novel coronavirus, and whether their family members support them working on the front line. Specific reasons are given in the following sections. 3.2.1 Degree of suspicion that they were infected when the novel coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, the level of concern whether they and their family members have been infected, whether they have supported in affected areas in Hubei Province, designated hospitals, and other places for the novel coronavirus, and whether family members support them working on the front line<br/><br/>COVID-19 patients are the main source of transmission of the disease. Patients with latent infection (i.e., asymptomatic infection) may also constitute a source of infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Medical personnel are in frequent close contact with patients during their treatment and care, hence the high risk of infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Among 138 patients admitted consecutively from January 1 to 28, 2020, to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, the proportion of medical personnel was as high as 29% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. A retrospective analysis of 1099 confirmed COVID-19 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces (diagnosis as of January 29) found that the proportion of medical staff was 2.09% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Therefore, medical staff are at high risk of infection and are under great psychological pressure. If they become infected as a result of supporting affected areas in Hubei and COVID-19 designated hospitals, it will not only affect their physical and mental health but also that of their families. Therefore, with the emergence of symptoms and the increase in the level of concern, the mental health status of clinical medical staff may deteriorate. Furthermore, if their families do not support them working on the front line against the disease, then the psychological burden of the medical staff will also increase due to the resulting sense of conflict with professional ethics, resulting in further impact on their physical and mental health.<br/><br/>3.2.2 Age: We found that the higher the age, the higher the mental health score and the more psychological problems. Based on the age distribution of patients across the country, all ages have no resistance to the novel coronavirus, and a person of any age can be infected as long as virus transmission conditions are met [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. An analysis of 4021 confirmed patients nationwide (diagnosis date as of January 26) also shows that people of all ages are generally vulnerable to the disease, of whom 71.45% are aged 30 to 65 years [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. As people get older, the risk of exposure to the disease may increase in people with underlying illness such as asthma, diabetes, and heart diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Therefore, older medical personnel have more psychological stress when dealing with COVID-19 patients. It is advised that older medical personnel receive psychological counseling before and during work to help them adjust their status as soon as possible. Despite all the above, this study believes that after such a \u201csmokeless\u201d war against the novel coronavirus, the psychological quality of medical personnel can be improved to a certain extent."

        "conclusion": [
            "In the face of the catastrophic health emergency caused by COVID-19, medical staff have been affected by different kinds of subjective and objective factors. Their mental health problems are a form of human stress response, an explanatory, emotional, and defensive response within the human body, and a physiological response of the human body to the invasion of needs or injuries. In this special environment, their work, life, and emotions tend to be regularly abnormal. Due to the requirements for isolation and disinfection, medical personnel need to wear several layers of protection clothing. This increases the intensity of their work and requires great physical energy, causing severe hypoxia and physical symptoms such as headache and muscle soreness. Other symptoms such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, hostility, and paranoid ideation are all normal psychological reactions in the handling of emergencies and environmental stimuli. In face of a disaster, persons with good mental health will tend to actively take measures such as catharsis, transference, compensation, relaxation, humor, self-consolation, and rational response. The results of this study show that the overall mental health of medical staff is generally poor when dealing with COVID-19. Psychological tests show that people have a process of adaptation to catastrophic emergencies, from initial rejection, shock, and fear, to habituation, acceptance, and calm, to co-existence and living together, which is a regular process. In the face of such a sudden disaster as COVID-19, these psychological symptoms have manifested in both doctors and patients. For medical personnel, it is particularly important to pay attention to mental health conditions while fulfilling their responsibilities. In future research, it is worth exploring how to strengthen the monitoring of mental health conditions of medical personnel and establish an active, systematic, and scientific psychological defense system under such special circumstances."

From January 25 to February 16, 2020, 560 medical personnel from 12 hospitals in eight provinces and cities across the country were enrolled as research subjects. Inclusion criteria: work experience \u2265 1 year; has given informed consent and agreed to participate in this study. 1.2 Methods 1.2.1 Survey tools Survey of demographic characteristics of medical personnel, including 18 questions related to the following aspects: province, hospital, department, occupation, gender, age, highest education level, work experience, level of expertise, marital status, children, living status, whether you have participated in training for handling of public health emergencies, whether family members support your working on the front line against coronavirus, whether you have supported in affected areas in Hubei, designated hospitals, department of infectious diseases, fever clinics or emergency department, level of concern whether you and your family have been infected, degree of suspicion that you were infected when coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, and whether you have received medical observation recently. The SCL-90 self-report inventory: The SCL-90 inventory, compiled by Derogatis in 1975, includes 10 factors and a total of 90 items. Each factor reflects the symptoms and pain of a patient in a certain aspect, and the distribution of symptoms can be understood through the factor scores. The 10 factors include somatization, obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism, sleep, and diet. Each item was scored using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging none, mild, moderate, moderate to severe, to severe. The total score is the sum of the scores of the 90 items. In previous studies, the homogeneity reliability of the total SCL-90 scale was 0.97, and the homogeneity reliability of each sub-scale was also greater than 0.68. The test-retest reliability was greater than 0.7, and the content validity was above 0.85, which suggest sound reliability and validity.",

            "3.1 Comparison of SCL-90 factor scores between medical personnel and the national norm group",
            "COVID-19 is a fulminant infectious disease. As it is highly contagious, many people are frightened by it and even talk fearfully about coronavirus, which can also be observed in front-line medical staff. The results of the study have shown that the overall mean of the SCL-90 and the mean values of the factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of medical personnel were significantly higher than that of the norm group (p < 0.05), while the average score of the interpersonal sensitivity factor of medical personnel was significantly lower than that of the norm group (p < 0.01). More specifically, medical personnel are most of the people closest to COVID-19 patients, so they are at high risk of exposure to the disease. Moreover, they have a deep understanding of the dangers of COVID-19, so they are prone to anxiety and fear. The infection protection procedures for COVID-19 are highly complex and medical staff need to constantly change clothes and replace protective equipment, so they are more likely to establish obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Medical personnel, especially young medical staff, have less experience in the field and in dealing with difficulties and hardships in life. Therefore, when they suddenly encounter such sudden public health events, they tend to suffer anxiety and phobic anxiety, leading to physical and mental problems. That is why scores of the factors somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism were significantly higher than in the norm group. This result suggests that psychologists and team leaders should pay more attention to the anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism issues of the medical personnel in a team. The average score for the interpersonal sensitivity factor of medical personnel was significantly lower than that of the norm group. This shows that in the event of an infectious disease epidemic, the majority of medical personnel are united and have good professional strengths and qualities for self-regulation and self-protection. The results of this study show partial consistency with the studies of the mental health status of front-line medical personnel for SARS in 2003 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. 3.2 Analysis of influencing factors of the mental health status of medical personnel",
            "The results of this study have shown that the factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel based on the significance from high to low are: the degree of suspicion that they were infected when the novel coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, the level of concern whether they and their family members have been infected, age, whether they have supported in affected areas in Hubei Province, designated hospitals, and other places for the novel coronavirus, and whether their family members support them working on the front line. Specific reasons are given in the following sections. 3.2.1 Degree of suspicion that they were infected when the novel coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, the level of concern whether they and their family members have been infected, whether they have supported in affected areas in Hubei Province, designated hospitals, and other places for the novel coronavirus, and whether family members support them working on the front line",
            "COVID-19 patients are the main source of transmission of the disease. Patients with latent infection (i.e., asymptomatic infection) may also constitute a source of infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Medical personnel are in frequent close contact with patients during their treatment and care, hence the high risk of infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Among 138 patients admitted consecutively from January 1 to 28, 2020, to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, the proportion of medical personnel was as high as 29% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].
