            "Demographic and clinical characteristics The National Health Commission has issued 11,791 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in China as of January 31st, 2020. At this time point for data cut-off, our database has included 1,590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities (see Online Supplement for details). Of these 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%)<br/><br/>were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of Wuhan city. The most common symptom was fever on or after hospitalization (88.0%), followed by dry cough (70.2%). Fatigue (42.8%) and productive cough (36.0%) were less common. At least one abnormal chest CT manifestation (including ground-glass opacities, pulmonary infiltrates and interstitial disorders) was identified in more than 70% of patients. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints during the study (Table 1).<br/><br/>Presence of comorbidities and the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19<br/><br/>Of the 1,590 cases, 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities encompassed hypertension (269 [16.9%]), diabetes (130 [8.2%]), and cardiovascular diseases (59 [3.7%]). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was identified in 24 cases. At least one comorbidity was seen more commonly in severe cases than in non-severe cases (32.8% vs. 10.3%). Patients with at least one comorbidity were older (mean: 60.8 vs. 44.8 years), were more likely to have shortness of breath (41.4% vs. 17.8%), nausea or vomiting (10.4% vs. 4.3%), and tended to have abnormal chest X-ray manifestations (29.2% vs. 15.1%) (Table 1).<br/><br/>Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 stratified by the number of comorbidities<br/><br/>We have further identified 130 (8.2%) patients who reported having two or more comorbidities.

            "Since November 2019, the rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which arose from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has recently become a public health emergency of international concern [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. COVID-19 has contributed to an enormous adverse impact globally. Hitherto, there have been 79,331 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,595 deaths globally as of February 25th, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].<br/><br/>The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are, according to the latest reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], largely heterogeneous. On admission, 20-51% of patients reported as having at least one comorbidity, with diabetes (10-20%), hypertension (10-15%) and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (7-40%) being most common [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of any comorbidity has been associated with a 3.4-fold increased risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with H7N9 infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Similar with influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], Severe Acute<br/><br/>Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], COVID-19 more readily predisposed to respiratory failure and death in susceptible patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Nonetheless, previous studies have been certain limitations in study design including the relatively small sample sizes and single center observations. Studies that address these limitations is needed to explore for the factors underlying the adverse impact of COVID-19.<br/><br/>Our objective was to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by stratification according to the presence and category of comorbidity, thus unraveling the subpopulations with poorer prognosis."

        "methods": [
            "Data sources and data extraction This was a retrospective cohort study that collected data from patients with COVID-19 throughout China, under the coordination of the National Health Commission which mandated the reporting of clinical information from individual designated hospitals which admitted patients with COVID-19. After careful medical chart review, we compiled the clinical data of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized cases from 575 hospitals between November 21st, 2019 and January 31st, 2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on the World Health Organization interim guidance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Confirmed cases denoted the patients whose high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay findings for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were positive [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. See Online Supplement for details.<br/><br/>The clinical data (including recent exposure history, clinical symptoms and signs, comorbidities, and laboratory findings upon admission) were reviewed and extracted by experienced respiratory clinicians, who subsequently entered the data into a computerized database for further cross-checking. Manifestations on chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) was summarized by integrating the documentation or description in medical charts and, if available, a further review by our medical staff. Major disagreement of the radiologic manifestations between the two reviewers was resolved by consultation with another independent reviewer. Because disease severity reportedly predicted poorer clinical outcomes of avian influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], patients were classified as having severe or non-severe COVID-19 based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia because of its global acceptance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].<br/><br/>Comorbidities were determined based on patient\u2019s self-report on admission. Comorbidities were initially treated as a categorical variable (Yes vs. No), and subsequently classified based on the number (Single vs. Multiple). Furthermore, comorbidities were sorted according to the organ systems (i.e. respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine). Comorbidities that were classified into the same organ system (i.e. coronary heart disease, hypertension) would be merged into a single category.<br/><br/>The primary endpoint of our study was a composite measure which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. This composite measure was adopted because all individual components were serious outcomes of H7N9 infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Secondary endpoints mainly included the mortality rate, and the time from symptom onset to reaching to the composite endpoints.<br/><br/>Statistical analysis<br/><br/>Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS software version 23.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). No formal sample size estimation was made because there has not been any published nationwide data on COVID-19. Nonetheless, our sample size was deemed sufficient to power the statistical analysis given its representativeness of the national patient population. Continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate, and the categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages. Independent t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square test were applied for the comparisons between the two groups as appropriate. Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with the composite endpoints, with the hazards ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) being reported.<br/><br/>Patient and public involvement No patients were directly involved in our study design, setting the research questions, the interpretation of data, or asked to advise on writing up of the report."

        "discussion": [
            "Our study is the first nationwide investigation that systematically evaluates the impact of comorbidities on the clinical characteristics and prognosis in patients with COVID-19 in China. Circulatory and endocrine comorbidities were common among patients with COVID-19. Patients with at least one comorbidity, or more even so, were associated with poor clinical outcomes. These findings have provided further objective evidence, with a large sample size and extensive coverage of the geographic regions across China, to take into account baseline comorbid diseases in the comprehensive risk assessment of prognosis among patients with COVID-19 on hospital admission.<br/><br/>Overall, our findings have echoed the recently published studies in terms of the commonness of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Despite considerable variations in the proportion in individual studies due to the limited sample size and the region where patients were managed, circulatory diseases (including hypertension and coronary heart diseases) remained the most common category of comorbidity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Apart from circulatory diseases, endocrine diseases such as diabetes were also common in patients with COVID-19. Notwithstanding the commonness of circulatory and endocrine comorbidities, patients with COVID-19 rarely reported as having comorbid respiratory diseases (particularly COPD). The reasons underlying this observation have been scant, but could have arisen from the lack of awareness and the lack of spirometric testing in community settings that collectively contributed to the underdiagnosis of respiratory diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Consistent with recent reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], the percentage of patients with comorbid renal disease and malignancy was relatively low. Our findings have therefore added to the existing literature the spectrum of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 based on the larger sample sizes and representativeness of the whole patient population in China.<br/><br/>A number of existing literature reports have documented the escalated risks of poorer clinical outcomes in patients with avian influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] and MERS-CoV infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. The most common comorbidities associated with poorer prognosis included diabetes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], hypertension [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], respiratory diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], cardiac diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], pregnancy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], renal diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] and malignancy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Our findings suggested that, similar with other severe acute respiratory outbreaks, comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, hypertension and malignancy predisposed to adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The strength of association between different comorbidities and the prognosis, however, was less consistent when compared with the literature reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. For instance, the risk between cardiac diseases and poor clinical outcomes of influenza, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infections was inconclusive [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Except for diabetes, no other comorbidities were identified to be the predictors of poor clinical outcomes in patients with MERS-CoV infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Few studies, however, have explored the mechanisms underlying these associations. Kulscar et al showed that MERS-CoV infections resulted in prolonged airway inflammation, immune cell dysfunction and an altered expression profile of inflammatory mediators [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. A network-based analysis indicated that SARS-CoV infections led to immune dysregulation that could help explain the escalated risk of cardiac diseases, bone diseases and malignancy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Therefore, immune dysregulation and prolonged inflammation might be the key drivers of the poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 but await verification in more mechanistic studies.<br/><br/>There has been a considerable overlap in the comorbidities which has been widely accepted. For instance, diabetes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] and COPD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] frequently co-exist with hypertension or coronary heart diseases. Therefore, patients with co-existing comorbidities are more likely to have poorer baseline well-being. Importantly, we have verified the significantly escalated risk of poor prognosis in patients with two or more comorbidities as compared with those who had no or only a single comorbidity. Our findings implied that both the category and number of comorbidities should be taken into account when predicting the prognosis in patients with COVID-19.<br/><br/>Our findings suggested that patients with comorbidities had greater disease severity compared with those without. A greater number of comorbidities correlated with greater disease severity of COVID-19. The public health implication of our study was that proper triage of patients should be implemented in out-patient clinics or on hospital admission by carefully inquiring the medical history because this will help identify patients who would be more likely to develop serious adverse outcomes during the progression of COVID-19. A multidisciplinary team with specialists would be needed to manage the comorbid conditions in a timely fashion. Moreover, patients with COIVD-19<br/><br/>who had comorbidities should be isolated immediately upon confirmation of the diagnosis, which would help provide with this susceptible population better personal medical protection.<br/><br/>The main limitation of our study was the self-report of comorbidities on admission. Underreporting of comorbidities, which could have stemmed from the lack of awareness and/or the lack of diagnostic testing, might contribute to the underestimation of the true strength of association with the clinical prognosis. However, significant underreporting was unlikely because the spectrum of our report was largely consistent with existing literature [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] and all patients were subject to a thorough history taking after hospital admission. Moreover, the duration of follow-up was relatively short and some patients remained in the hospital as of the time of writing. More studies that explore the associations in a sufficiently long time frame are warranted. As with other observational studies, our findings did not provide direct inference about the causation or reverse causation of comorbidities and the poor clinical outcomes. Conclusions Comorbidities are present in around one fourth of patients with COVID-19 in China, and predispose to poorer clinical outcomes. A thorough assessment of comorbidities may help establish risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 upon hospital admission."

The most common symptom was fever on or after hospitalization (88.0%), followed by dry cough (70.2%). Fatigue (42.8%) and productive cough (36.0%) were less common. At least one abnormal chest CT manifestation (including ground-glass opacities, pulmonary infiltrates and interstitial disorders) was identified in more than 70% of patients. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints during the study (Table 1).",

        "Introduction": [
            "Since November 2019, the rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which arose from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has recently become a public health emergency of international concern [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. COVID-19 has contributed to an enormous adverse impact globally. Hitherto, there have been 79,331 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,595 deaths globally as of February 25th, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].",
            "The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are, according to the latest reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], largely heterogeneous. On admission, 20-51% of patients reported as having at least one comorbidity, with diabetes (10-20%), hypertension (10-15%) and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (7-40%) being most common [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of any comorbidity has been associated with a 3.4-fold increased risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with H7N9 infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Similar with influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], Severe Acute",

Nonetheless, previous studies have been certain limitations in study design including the relatively small sample sizes and single center observations. Studies that address these limitations is needed to explore for the factors underlying the adverse impact of COVID-19.",
            "Our objective was to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by stratification according to the presence and category of comorbidity, thus unraveling the subpopulations with poorer prognosis."
        ],
        "Methods": [
            "Data sources and data extraction This was a retrospective cohort study that collected data from patients with COVID-19 throughout China, under the coordination of the National Health Commission which mandated the reporting of clinical information from individual designated hospitals which admitted patients with COVID-19. After careful medical chart review, we compiled the clinical data of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized cases from 575 hospitals between November 21st, 2019 and January 31st, 2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on the World Health Organization interim guidance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Confirmed cases denoted the patients whose high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay findings for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were positive [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. See Online Supplement for details.",
            "The clinical data (including recent exposure history, clinical symptoms and signs, comorbidities, and laboratory findings upon admission) were reviewed and extracted by experienced respiratory clinicians, who subsequently entered the data into a computerized database for further cross-checking. Manifestations on chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) was summarized by integrating the documentation or description in medical charts and, if available, a further review by our medical staff. Major disagreement of the radiologic manifestations between the two reviewers was resolved by consultation with another independent reviewer. Because disease severity reportedly predicted poorer clinical outcomes of avian influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], patients were classified as having severe or non-severe COVID-19 based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia because of its global acceptance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].",
            "Comorbidities were determined based on patient\u2019s self-report on admission. Comorbidities were initially treated as a categorical variable (Yes vs. No), and subsequently classified based on the number (Single vs. Multiple). Furthermore, comorbidities were sorted according to the organ systems (i.e. respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine). Comorbidities that were classified into the same organ system (i.e. coronary heart disease, hypertension) would be merged into a single category.",
            "The primary endpoint of our study was a composite measure which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. This composite measure was adopted because all individual components were serious outcomes of H7N9 infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Secondary endpoints mainly included the mortality rate, and the time from symptom onset to reaching to the composite endpoints.",
            "Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS software version 23.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). No formal sample size estimation was made because there has not been any published nationwide data on COVID-19. Nonetheless, our sample size was deemed sufficient to power the statistical analysis given its representativeness of the national patient population. Continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate, and the categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages. Independent t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square test were applied for the comparisons between the two groups as appropriate. Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with the composite endpoints, with the hazards ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) being reported.",
            "Patient and public involvement No patients were directly involved in our study design, setting the research questions, the interpretation of data, or asked to advise on writing up of the report."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "Our study is the first nationwide investigation that systematically evaluates the impact of comorbidities on the clinical characteristics and prognosis in patients with COVID-19 in China. Circulatory and endocrine comorbidities were common among patients with COVID-19. Patients with at least one comorbidity, or more even so, were associated with poor clinical outcomes. These findings have provided further objective evidence, with a large sample size and extensive coverage of the geographic regions across China, to take into account baseline comorbid diseases in the comprehensive risk assessment of prognosis among patients with COVID-19 on hospital admission.",
            "Overall, our findings have echoed the recently published studies in terms of the commonness of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Despite considerable variations in the proportion in individual studies due to the limited sample size and the region where patients were managed, circulatory diseases (including hypertension and coronary heart diseases) remained the most common category of comorbidity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Apart from circulatory diseases, endocrine diseases such as diabetes were also common in patients with COVID-19. Notwithstanding the commonness of circulatory and endocrine comorbidities, patients with COVID-19 rarely reported as having comorbid respiratory diseases (particularly COPD). The reasons underlying this observation have been scant, but could have arisen from the lack of awareness and the lack of spirometric testing in community settings that collectively contributed to the underdiagnosis of respiratory diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Consistent with recent reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], the percentage of patients with comorbid renal disease and malignancy was relatively low. Our findings have therefore added to the existing literature the spectrum of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 based on the larger sample sizes and representativeness of the whole patient population in China.",
            "A number of existing literature reports have documented the escalated risks of poorer clinical outcomes in patients with avian influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] and MERS-CoV infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. The most common comorbidities associated with poorer prognosis included diabetes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], hypertension [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], respiratory diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], cardiac diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], pregnancy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], renal diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] and malignancy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Our findings suggested that, similar with other severe acute respiratory outbreaks, comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, hypertension and malignancy predisposed to adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The strength of association between different comorbidities and the prognosis, however, was less consistent when compared with the literature reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. For instance, the risk between cardiac diseases and poor clinical outcomes of influenza, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infections was inconclusive [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Except for diabetes, no other comorbidities were identified to be the predictors of poor clinical outcomes in patients with MERS-CoV infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Few studies, however, have explored the mechanisms underlying these associations. Kulscar et al showed that MERS-CoV infections resulted in prolonged airway inflammation, immune cell dysfunction and an altered expression profile of inflammatory mediators [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. A network-based analysis indicated that SARS-CoV infections led to immune dysregulation that could help explain the escalated risk of cardiac diseases, bone diseases and malignancy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Therefore, immune dysregulation and prolonged inflammation might be the key drivers of the poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 but await verification in more mechanistic studies.",
            "There has been a considerable overlap in the comorbidities which has been widely accepted. For instance, diabetes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] and COPD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] frequently co-exist with hypertension or coronary heart diseases. Therefore, patients with co-existing comorbidities are more likely to have poorer baseline well-being. Importantly, we have verified the significantly escalated risk of poor prognosis in patients with two or more comorbidities as compared with those who had no or only a single comorbidity. Our findings implied that both the category and number of comorbidities should be taken into account when predicting the prognosis in patients with COVID-19.",
            "Our findings suggested that patients with comorbidities had greater disease severity compared with those without. A greater number of comorbidities correlated with greater disease severity of COVID-19. The public health implication of our study was that proper triage of patients should be implemented in out-patient clinics or on hospital admission by carefully inquiring the medical history because this will help identify patients who would be more likely to develop serious adverse outcomes during the progression of COVID-19. A multidisciplinary team with specialists would be needed to manage the comorbid conditions in a timely fashion. Moreover, patients with COIVD-19",
            "who had comorbidities should be isolated immediately upon confirmation of the diagnosis, which would help provide with this susceptible population better personal medical protection.",
            "The main limitation of our study was the self-report of comorbidities on admission. Underreporting of comorbidities, which could have stemmed from the lack of awareness and/or the lack of diagnostic testing, might contribute to the underestimation of the true strength of association with the clinical prognosis. However, significant underreporting was unlikely because the spectrum of our report was largely consistent with existing literature [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] and all patients were subject to a thorough history taking after hospital admission.
