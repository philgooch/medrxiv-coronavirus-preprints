        "abstract": "Backgrounds: There has been a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak in China since December 2019, and which spreads internationally. This is the first study to quantify the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. Methods: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 21, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (\u03b3), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. Findings: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 3.30 (95%CI: 2.73-3.96) to 5.47 (95%CI: 4.16-7.10) associated with 0-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. With rising report rate, the mean R0 is likely to be below 5 but above 3. Conclusion: The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 3.30 (95%CI: 2.73-3.96) to 5.47 (95%CI: 4.16-7.10), and significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.",

            "The atypical pneumonia case, caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first suspected and reported in Wuhan, China in December 31, 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. By the end of January 22, 2020, there have been 571 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infections in mainland China, including 17 deaths [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The 2019-nCoV cases were also reported in Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US, and all these cases were exported from China, see WHO news release https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/ from January 14-21. The outbreak is still on-going. A recently published preprint by Imai et al estimated that a total of 1723 (95%CI: 427-4471) cases of nCoV infections in Wuhan had onset of symptoms by January 12, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The likelihood of travel related risks of disease spreading is suggested by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], which indicates the potentials of regional and global spread [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].<br/><br/>To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing peer-reviewed literature quantifying the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV as of January 22, 2020. In this study, we estimated the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV via the basic reproduction number, R0, based on the limited data in the early phase of the outbreak."

The coefficient of determination, R-squared, ranges from 0.86 to 0.87 for all reporting rate changing scenarios, which implies that the early outbreak data were largely following the exponential growth. In Table1, we estimated that the R0 ranges from 3.30 (95%CI: 2.73-3.96) to 5.47 (95%CI: 4.16-7.10) associated with 0-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. All R0 estimates are significantly larger than 1, which indicates the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks. Since the official diagnostic protocol was released by WHO on January 17 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], an increase in the diagnosis and reporting of 2019-nCoV infections probably occurred. Thereafter, the daily number of newly reported cases started increasing around January 17, see Fig 1, which implies that more infections were likely being diagnosed and recorded. We suggested that changing in reporting might exist thus should be considered in estimation. Although four scenarios about the reporting rate were explored in this study, the real situation is difficult to determine given limited data and (almost) equivalent model fitting performance in terms of Rsquared. However, with the rising in the reporting rate, we found the mean R0 is likely to be below 5 but above 3. Our analysis and estimation of R0 rely on the accuracy of the SI of 2019-nCoV, which remains unknown as of January 21. In this work, we employed the SIs of SARS and MERS as approximations to that of 2019-nCoV. The determination of SI requires the knowledge of the chain of disease transmission that needs sufficient number of patient samples and periods of time for follow-up [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], and thus this is unlikely to be achieved shortly. However, using SIs of SARS and MERS as approximation could provide an insight to the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV at the early stage of the outbreak. We reported that the mean R0 of 2019nCoV is likely to be from 3.3 to 5.5, and it appeared (slightly) higher than those of SARS, i.e., 2-5 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], and MERS, i.e., 2.7-3.9 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Furthermore, measures on \u2018entry, exit and travel\u2019 screening and restriction started today (on January 23) in Wuhan is likely to reduce the R0, which is benefit for the 2019-nCoV control and prevention."

            "Backgrounds: There has been a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak in China since December 2019, and which spreads internationally. This is the first study to quantify the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. Methods: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 21, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (\u03b3), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. Findings: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 3.30 (95%CI: 2.73-3.96) to 5.47 (95%CI: 4.16-7.10) associated with 0-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate.

            "The atypical pneumonia case, caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first suspected and reported in Wuhan, China in December 31, 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. By the end of January 22, 2020, there have been 571 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infections in mainland China, including 17 deaths [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The 2019-nCoV cases were also reported in Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US, and all these cases were exported from China, see WHO news release https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/ from January 14-21. The outbreak is still on-going. A recently published preprint by Imai et al estimated that a total of 1723 (95%CI: 427-4471) cases of nCoV infections in Wuhan had onset of symptoms by January 12, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The likelihood of travel related risks of disease spreading is suggested by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], which indicates the potentials of regional and global spread [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].",
            "To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing peer-reviewed literature quantifying the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV as of January 22, 2020.
