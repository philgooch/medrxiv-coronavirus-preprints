            "<strong>Results for Region</strong><br/><br/>1 and Region 3 of Iran<br/><br/>In addition to estimating the reproduction number of COVID-19 across Iran, we further analyzed the data for Region 1 and Region 3 of Iran, which happened to have higher numbers of cumulative number of cases than other regions by February 29, 2020. Region 1 of Iran include Qom Province (QOM), Tehran Province (TEH), Mazandaran Province (MAZ), Alborz Province (ALB), Semnan Province (SEM), Golestan<br/><br/>Province (GOL), and Qazvin Province (QAZ). Region 3 of Iran include Gilan Province (GIL), Ardabil<br/><br/>Province (ARD), East Azerbajian Province (AZS), West Azerbajian Province (AZG), Kurdistan (or<br/><br/>For Region 1, using Method 1, we estimated a reproduction number of 3.6 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.4) with a growth rate of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.89) and a scaling parameter of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.99). Using Method 2, the estimated epidemic doubling time was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.10, 1.61) and the estimated reproduction number was 3.40 (95% CI, 1.27, 7.91) (Table S2, Figures S1, S2 and S3).<br/><br/>For Region 3, using Method 1, we estimated a reproduction number of 3.0 (95% CI, 2.2, 4.2) with a growth rate of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.54, 1.6) and a scaling parameter of 0.80 (95% CI 0.63, 0.98). Using Method 2, the estimated epidemic doubling time was 1.30 (95% CI, 1.04, 1.78) and the estimated reproduction number was 3.38 (95% CI, 1.26, 8.04) (Table S2, Figures S1, S2 and S3).<br/><br/>It appeared that whether it was for Iran as a whole, or for its Region 1 or Region 3, the point estimate of the estimated reproduction number was 3.0 or higher. However, the estimates obtained from Method 1 had a smaller variance. The estimates obtained from Method 2 had a larger variance, given the large variance of the serial interval estimate that we used.<br/><br/>You C, Deng Y, Hu W, Sun J, Lin Q, Zhou F, et al Estimation of the Time-Varying Reproduction<br/><br/>Number of COVID-19 Outbreak in China. medRxiv. 2020:2020.02.08.20021253.<br/><br/>Nishiura H, Chowell G.

The virus appears to be spreading rapidly with cases reported among the elite (3). One model estimated that 18,300",

            "To confront the epidemic, we are interested in evaluating the transmission potential of COVID-19 to facilitate outbreak response efforts including the scope and intensity of interventions. The basic reproduction number, R0, represents such a measurement indicating the average number of secondary cases that primary cases generate in a completely susceptible population in the absence of interventions or behavioral changes. R0>1 indicated the possibility of sustained transmission, whereas R0<1 implies that transmission chains cannot sustain epidemic growth. As the epidemic continues its course, the effective reproduction number offers a time-dependent record of the average number of secondary cases per case as the number of susceptible individuals gets depleted and control interventions takes effect. Herein we employed two different methods to quantify the reproduction number using the curve of reported COVID-",

Two methods were utilized to estimate the reproduction number. The first method utilized a generalized growth model (GGM) (6) with the growth rate and its scaling factor to characterize the daily reported incidence, followed by simulation of the calibrated GGM, using a discretized probability distribution of the serial interval and assuming a",
            "The second method for estimating the reproduction number is based on the calculation of the epidemic\u2019s doubling times, which correspond to the times when the cumulative incidence doubles. We estimated the epidemic doubling time using the curve of cumulative daily reported cases. To quantify parameter uncertainty, we used parametric bootstrapping with a Poisson error structure around the number of new reported cases in order to derive 95% confidence intervals of our estimates. Assuming exponential growth, the epidemic growth rate is equal to ln(2)/doubling time. Assuming that the preinfectious and infectious periods follow an exponential distribution, R0 is approximately equal to 1 +",
            "In both methods, the serial interval was assumed to follow a gamma distribution (mean: 4.41 days; standard deviation: 3.17 days) (7, 8). MATLAB version R2019b and R version 3.6.2 were used for data analyses and creating figures. It was determined a priori that \u03b1= 0.05.",
            "2, we found that from February 19 through February 29, the cumulative incidence of confirmed cases in Iran had doubled 8 times. The estimated epidemic doubling time is 1.20 (95% CI, 1.05, 1.44)",
