        "abstract": "Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of new type of coronavirus named COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. In a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development. The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these Chinese strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. \nMethods: From the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax). Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number of plateaus were analyzed.\nResults: The quartic model showed the best fit. For almost all areas in mainland China, the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China.\nConclusion: Our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. These strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the COVID-19 epidemic.",

            "On December 8, 2019, the first patient with atypical pneumonia of unknown origin was reported by the government of Wuhan, Hubei, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Since then, the outbreak in Wuhan became an epidemic, rapidly spreading through China and other countries. On January 1, 2020, a new type of coronavirus was isolated and finally named COVID19 by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. According to reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], by March 1, 2020, more than 60 countries or areas had reported the confirmed patients with COVID-19, and more than 80,000 patients had been confirmed with COVID-19 worldwide. This has serious implications for both public health and development in China and the world.<br/><br/>To control the diffusion and deterioration of the epidemic of COVID-19 in China, the Chinese government implemented series of strict and unprecedented intervention strategies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. For example, on January 21, 2020, COVID-19 was classed as a Class B infectious disease and was controlled as a Class A infectious disease; on January 23, 2020, Wuhan was quarantined to limit the diffusion of patients with COVID-19. All other provinces and areas in China also began to control public gatherings and the migration of people from January 21, 2020. These mandatory strategies carried out by the government showed significant effects on containing the contagion of COVID-19, and the number of new confirmed cases remarkably decreased at the end of February 2020."

            "Model fitting for known data in mainland China<br/><br/>First, we performed model fitting of different areas in mainland China except for Xizang and Qinghai because the confirmed number of cases were too few in these areas to model. The fitted curves were good, and all correlation coefficients R2 > 0.99 except for those in Jilin (R2 = 0.989) and Hubei (R2 = 0.988). Areas were divided into three parts: areas adjoined to Hubei (Figure 1), northern areas (Figure 2), and southern areas (Figure 3) of China. Because of an adjustment to confirmation criteria, the number of confirmed patients in Wuhan surged on February 22, 2020. Similarly, 200 new confirmed patients surged in Shandong on February 19, 2020 due to an outbreak of COVID-19 in a prison. However, the growth speed had basically reached zero since February 17, 2020 in Shandong. To eliminate the influence of this specific incident and perform model fitting, we fit the model for Shandong with adjusted data."

            "COVID-19, a new and severe epidemic, has threatened public health and economic development in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. As of March 6, 2020, the number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 has reached 100,000 worldwide, and some countries such as Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran are also suffering from the rapid spread of COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. The need for greater attention and intervention strategies to curb the spread of COVID-19 around the world is of paramount importance.<br/><br/>To inhibit the spread of COVID-19 as quickly as possible, the Chinese government took actions rapidly and implemented a series of strategies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. For example, (1) President Xi of China conducted and deployed the control of COVID-19 personally, and all-of-government and all-of-society approaches were employed to contain viral spread; (2) Wuhan and other areas in Hubei were thoroughly quarantined, and the flow of people was completely restricted over the China; (3) a large number of doctors and nurses over China were assigned to Hubei to cure patients with COVID-19; (4) new special hospitals and vast mobile cabin hospitals were constructed quickly for accommodating patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 and grading treatments; (5) critical medical resources and goods were regulated and distributed by the government; (6) traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine were combined to treat patients.<br/><br/>To better understand and estimate the effects of Chinese strategies on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 in mainland China, we implemented model fitting and designed an index named Speedmax, which represented the time when the growth speed of the cumulative confirmed cases reached its maximum. According to our analyses, the growth speed generally increased first and decreased to zero quickly after reaching the Speedmax point. The area under the curve (AUC) of the derivative function represents the cumulative number of confirmed cases. Thus, per region, a shorter time to Speedmax generally indicates a smaller AUC, representing fewer cumulative confirmed cases when reaching the plateau. Therefore, to some extent, the time to Speedmax demonstrates the effectiveness of strategies on inhibiting the spread of virus. Notably, since the plateau number is affected by multiple factors, it is inappropriate to conclude that one area with shorter Speedmax means fewer plateau number than another area with longer Speedmax. The Speedmax is useful for assessing changes of the plateau number itself."

The effects of Chinese strategies will be better understood if the time to Speedmax and changes in R0 are discussed together.

            "On December 8, 2019, the first patient with atypical pneumonia of unknown origin was reported by the government of Wuhan, Hubei, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Since then, the outbreak in Wuhan became an epidemic, rapidly spreading through China and other countries. On January 1, 2020, a new type of coronavirus was isolated and finally named COVID19 by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. According to reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], by March 1, 2020, more than 60 countries or areas had reported the confirmed patients with COVID-19, and more than 80,000 patients had been confirmed with COVID-19 worldwide. This has serious implications for both public health and development in China and the world.",
            "To control the diffusion and deterioration of the epidemic of COVID-19 in China, the Chinese government implemented series of strict and unprecedented intervention strategies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. For example, on January 21, 2020, COVID-19 was classed as a Class B infectious disease and was controlled as a Class A infectious disease; on January 23, 2020, Wuhan was quarantined to limit the diffusion of patients with COVID-19. All other provinces and areas in China also began to control public gatherings and the migration of people from January 21, 2020. These mandatory strategies carried out by the government showed significant effects on containing the contagion of COVID-19, and the number of new confirmed cases remarkably decreased at the end of February 2020.",
            "To estimate optimally the effects of Chinese strategies on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 in China, we performed model fitting and calculated the time at which the growth speed of the cumulative number of confirmed patients reached the maximum."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "First, we performed model fitting of different areas in mainland China except for Xizang and Qinghai because the confirmed number of cases were too few in these areas to model. The fitted curves were good, and all correlation coefficients R2 > 0.99 except for those in Jilin (R2 = 0.989) and Hubei (R2 = 0.988). Areas were divided into three parts: areas adjoined to Hubei (Figure 1), northern areas (Figure 2), and southern areas (Figure 3) of China. Because of an adjustment to confirmation criteria, the number of confirmed patients in Wuhan surged on February 22, 2020. Similarly, 200 new confirmed patients surged in Shandong on February 19, 2020 due to an outbreak of COVID-19 in a prison. However, the growth speed had basically reached zero since February 17, 2020 in Shandong. To eliminate the influence of this specific incident and perform model fitting, we fit the model for Shandong with adjusted data.",
            "Calculation of Speedmax In this study, HongKong, Macao and Taiwan were not analyzed. Xizang, Xinjiang, Qinghai and Ningxia were not appropriate for Speedmax analyses because the confirmed patients were few or the growth speed was too smooth. Almost all areas in mainland China reached Speedmax within 14 days except Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei (Figure 4). Thus, the growth speed of confirmed cases began to decline in almost all areas before February 3, 2020. Because the outbreak of COVID-19 originated from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, more time was required for Hubei and Wuhan to reach Speedmax (21\u201322 days and 23\u201324 days, respectively), although strict strategies were implemented in these regions.",
            "The heat map of times for Speedmax suggests that the distance from other areas to Hubei have little influence arriving at Speedmax (Figure 4). After implementation of strict intervention strategies, the diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 was inhibited quickly and effectively over China. Even the speed in Hubei, with the exception of Wuhan, reached Speedmax and began to decline in 14\u201315 days, which showed similar trends to those of other areas in mainland China.",
            "As shown in Table 1, the average time to Speedmax was 11\u201312 days in China, with the exception of Hubei. Because little information was acquired at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19, it is understandable that Wuhan needed a longer time to reach the Speedmax point.",
            "The detailed data for the time to Speedmax and emigration index was shown in Supplementary Table 1.",
            "The plateau of cumulative confirmed patients of COVID-19 The heat map of the plateau in mainland China (Figure 5) revealed that the plateau numbers were higher in areas adjoined to Hubei and southern areas of China and were lower in the northern area, especially in the western part of the northern area of China. After regression analysis and model-fitting, results suggested that the number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index, and the correlation coefficient reached 0.74 (Figure 6). However, the plateau numbers had no significant correlation with the time of Speedmax when compared with different areas in China. In Zhejiang, though the plateau numbers ranked third among mainland China except",
            "Hubei, the growth speed reached the Speedmax point and declined earlier than in many areas. This suggested that the spread of COVID-19 was controlled more quickly and effectively in Zhejiang. More detail about the number of plateaus is shown in Supplementary Table 1."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "COVID-19, a new and severe epidemic, has threatened public health and economic development in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. As of March 6, 2020, the number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 has reached 100,000 worldwide, and some countries such as Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran are also suffering from the rapid spread of COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. The need for greater attention and intervention strategies to curb the spread of COVID-19 around the world is of paramount importance.",
            "To inhibit the spread of COVID-19 as quickly as possible, the Chinese government took actions rapidly and implemented a series of strategies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. For example, (1) President Xi of China conducted and deployed the control of COVID-19 personally, and all-of-government and all-of-society approaches were employed to contain viral spread; (2) Wuhan and other areas in Hubei were thoroughly quarantined, and the flow of people was completely restricted over the China; (3) a large number of doctors and nurses over China were assigned to Hubei to cure patients with COVID-19; (4) new special hospitals and vast mobile cabin hospitals were constructed quickly for accommodating patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 and grading treatments; (5) critical medical resources and goods were regulated and distributed by the government; (6) traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine were combined to treat patients.",
            "To better understand and estimate the effects of Chinese strategies on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 in mainland China, we implemented model fitting and designed an index named Speedmax, which represented the time when the growth speed of the cumulative confirmed cases reached its maximum. According to our analyses, the growth speed generally increased first and decreased to zero quickly after reaching the Speedmax point. The area under the curve (AUC) of the derivative function represents the cumulative number of confirmed cases. Thus, per region, a shorter time to Speedmax generally indicates a smaller AUC, representing fewer cumulative confirmed cases when reaching the plateau. Therefore, to some extent, the time to Speedmax demonstrates the effectiveness of strategies on inhibiting the spread of virus. Notably, since the plateau number is affected by multiple factors, it is inappropriate to conclude that one area with shorter Speedmax means fewer plateau number than another area with longer Speedmax. The Speedmax is useful for assessing changes of the plateau number itself.",
            "According to our study, we found that these Chinese strategies for controlling the diffusion of COVID-19 are significantly effective and powerful. By implementing multiple Chinese strategies, the growth speed of confirmed patients reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days in almost all areas of mainland China. Yang et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] also reported that a five-day delay in the implementation of the Chinese strategies would have increased the epidemic size in mainland China threefold. In addition, we found that the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus have little influence arriving at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, the diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China. With the exception of Wuhan, even Hubei, where the cumulative confirmed patients reached 17,680 on February 23, 2020, the speed of growth still reached Speedmax and began to decline in 14\u201315 days.",
            "The present study has certain limitations. In this study, we simplified the model analysis and performed model fitting with known data. Although the classical susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) and susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) models were not adopted, the quartic model showed a good fit to known data. This helps us to learn the trends of cumulative confirmed cases quickly and easily. However, our fitted models were all based on known data as it was more appropriate than forecasting future data trends. In addition, the changes in trends of basic reproduction number (R0) are not discussed in our study. The effects of Chinese strategies will be better understood if the time to Speedmax and changes in R0 are discussed together. Third, more data of different infectious diseases and studies are needed to verify the effectiveness and value of the index Speedmax.",
            "In conclusion, by analyzing the time to Speedmax, our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the Novel Coronavirus\u2013Infected Pneumonia. These strategies therefore provide experience and effective guidelines for other countries to control the diffusion of COVID-19."
