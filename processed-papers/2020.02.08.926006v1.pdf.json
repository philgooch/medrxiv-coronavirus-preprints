        "abstract": "In December 2019, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) induced an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China. It enters into host cell via cellular receptor recognization and membrane fusion. The former is based on angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). In the latter process, type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) play important roles in spike protein cleavage and activation. In this study, we used the single-cell transcriptomes of normal human lung and gastroenteric system to identify the ACE2- and TTSP-coexpressing cell composition and proportion. The results revealed that TMPRSS2 was highly co-expressed with",

            "At the end of 2019, a rising number of pneumonia patients with unknown pathogen emerged from Wuhan to nearly the entire China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. A novel coronavirus was isolated from the human airway epithelial cells and named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. By analyzing complete genome sequences, 2019-nCoV has an 86.9%<br/><br/>nucleotide sequence identity to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like author/funder. It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.<br/><br/>coronavirus detected in bats (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1) and is suggested to be the species of SARS related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) by pairwise protein sequence analysis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].<br/><br/>As a human coronavirus (HCoV), its prerequisite of infection is entering host cells.<br/><br/>During this process, the spike (S) glycoprotein of HCoV plays an important role[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].<br/><br/>The surface unit (S1) of S protein mediates the entry into host cells by binding to cellular receptor and the transmembrane unit (S2) subunit harbors the functional elements for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. It should be noted that the cleavage of S protein is priming to be activated which is essential for viral infectivity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Thus, this process not only needs virus-binding components (cell receptors), but also requires virus protein-cleaving components (cell proteases)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].<br/><br/>In 2019-nCoV infection, a metallopeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)<br/><br/>is proved to be the cellular receptor, same as SARS-CoV infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. As the host cell protease of ACE2, the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as<br/><br/>TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D, can cleave and activate the SARS-CoV S protein (SARS-S) for membrane fusion and also cleave ACE2 to promote viral uptake [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].<br/><br/>Thus, we suppose that TTSPs may also play a significant role in 2019-nCoV infection.<br/><br/>In order to identify the ACE2- and TTSP-coexpressing cell composition and proportion, we used the single-cell transcriptomes of normal human lung and gastroenteric system based on the public databases. TMPRSS2 was highly co-expressed with ACE2 in absorptive enterocytes, upper epithelial cells of esophagus and lung AT2 cells. In addition, we also explore the cleavage effects of TMPRSS2 in<br/><br/>2019-nCoV based on its structure. A striking finding was that the insertion sequence in 2019-nCoV S protein may increase the cleavage activity of TMPRSS2. Thus, as a previously reported antiviral target, transmembrane serine protease inhibitors may also be used for 2019-nCoV treatment targeting TMPRSS2."

            "Annotation of cell types<br/><br/>In this study, 5 datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of esophagus, gastric, small intestine and colon were analyzed, along with lung. Based on Cell Ranger output, the gene expression count matrices were used to present sequential clustering of cells according to different organs or particular clusters. The cell type identity in each cluster was annotated by the expression of the known cell type markers.<br/><br/>Cell type-specific expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11D and ADAM17<br/><br/>After initial quality controls, 57,020 cells and 15 clusters were identified in the lung (Fig. 1A). The detected cell types included ciliated, alveolar type 1 (AT1) and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, along with fibroblast, muscle, and endothelial cells. The identified immune cell types were T, B and NK cells, along with macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells (DC). ACE2 was mainly expressed in AT2 cells along with AT1 and fibroblast cells, while TMPRSS2 was found in AT1 and AT2 cells; and<br/><br/>TMPRSS11D was expressed in AT1 cells, fibroblast and macrophage (Fig. 1B). The<br/><br/>Violin plots showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were co-expressed in AT1 and AT2<br/><br/>cells. TMPRSS11D was not found in any clusters, whereas ADAM17 was found in all clusters (Fig. 1C). The Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and<br/><br/>TMPRSS11D in nomal lung showed a similar result (Fig. 1D).<br/><br/>In the esophagus, 87,947 cells passed quality control and 14 cell types were identified.<br/><br/>Over 90% cells belong to four major epithelial cell types: upper, stratified, suprabasal, and dividing cells of the suprabasal layer. ACE2 was highly expressed in upper and stratified epithelial cells, while TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D were found in upper epithelial cells. ADAM17 was found in almost all clusters (Fig. 2A).<br/><br/>A total of 29,678 cells and 10 cell types were identified in the stomach after quality control with a high proportion of gastric epithelial cells, including antral basal gland mucous cells (GMCs), pit mucous cells (PMCs), chief cells and enteroendocrine cells.<br/><br/>The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS11D are relatively low in all the clusters, while<br/><br/>TMPRSS2 was found in GMCs and PMCs. ADAM17 was also found in all clusters (Fig. 2B).<br/><br/>After quality controls, 11,218 cells and 5 cell types were identified in the ileum epithelia (Fig. 2C). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes. In the meantime, TMPRSS2 was also lowly expressed in goblet and<br/><br/>Paneth cells. TMPRSS11D was not found in any cluster, whereas ADAM17 was found in all clusters except undifferentiated cells (Fig. 2C).<br/><br/>All the 47,442 cells from the colon were annotated after quality controls. Absorptive and secretory clusters were identified in epithelial cells. The absorptive epithelial cells included transit amplifying (TA) cells (TA 1, TA 2), immature enterocytes, and enterocytes. The secretory epithelial cells comprised progenitor cells (secretory TA, immature goblet) and for mature cells (goblet, and enteroendocrine). ACE2 was mainly found in enterocytes and less expressed in immature enterocytes, so was<br/><br/>TMPRSS2. Other clusters also had a lower expression of TMPRSS2. TMPRSS11D was not found in any cluster and ADAM17 was expressed in enteroendocrine cells (Fig. 2D).<br/><br/>The expressions of ACE2, classic TTSPs (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS3, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS6, TMPRSS11D, TMPRSS14 and ADAM17 were detected in lung and digestive tract clusters. An almost consistent expression and distribution was only found between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in all the 9 clusters, with high expression in absorptive enterocytes, upper epithelial cells of esophagus and lung AT2 cells (Fig.<br/><br/>3A). The endocytosis and exocytosis-associated genes which are related to the entry of virus into host cells were also detected in all the 9 clusters. The endocytosis signature were more expressed in colon and exocytosis signature were more expressed in upper epithelial cells of esophagus (Fig. 3B). The RNA-seq data of lung, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon-transverse and colon-sigmoid were obtained from GTEx database. The expressions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 also had a similar tendency and were highly expressed in small intestine and colon, while the<br/><br/>TMPRSS11D was mainly found in the esophagus (Fig. 3C).<br/><br/>The structure of the SARS-S and 2019-nCoV S protein homo-trimers<br/><br/>The structure of the SARS-S and 2019-nCoV S protein were compared. The insert aa675-690 to SARS-S aa661-672 with the structural missed residues are colored green (Fig. 4A). Although the 2019-nCoV S protein has similar structure with<br/><br/>SARS-S, there was a very obvious insertion sequence (QTQTNSPRRARSVASQS) in<br/><br/>2019-nCoV S protein. The insert aa675-690 of 2019-nCoV S protein that corresponds to the insert region of SARS-S is colored yellow (Fig. 4B). The structural superimpose of SARS-S (wheat) and 2019-nCoV S protein (cyan) (Fig. 4B).<br/><br/>The obvious insertion sequence in 2019-nCoV S protein is at residue R685, especially at R682 and R683 ( the orange frame in Fig. 5A and the yellow structure in Fig. 5B).<br/><br/>In addition, the insertion sequence of R682 and R683 was protruded from the molecular surface (Fig. 5B, C).<br/><br/>Structure and catalytic mechanism of TMPRSS2<br/><br/>The catalytic triad comprised of H296, D345 and S441 are colored blue, green and cyan, respectively, the substrate binding residue D435 which located in the bottom of pocket is marked in red, the substrate binding pocket is deeper than most of serine proteinase (Fig. 6A, B). The bottom of TMPRSS2 has a negatively charged aspartic acid residue which can facilitate the binding and stabilization of the long-chain positively charged amino acid residue of substrate.

            "The coronaviruses is the common infection source of enteric, respiratory, and central nervous system in humans and other mammals[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, two betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, result in persistent public panics and became the most significant public health events[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. In<br/><br/>December 2019, a novel identified coronavirus (2019-nCoV) induced an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Till now, the pathogenic mechanism of 2019-nCoV is still unclear. In this study, we found the high co-expression between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the absorptive enterocytes, upper epithelial cells of esophagus and lung AT2 cells. Additionally, the insertion sequence (680-SPRR-683) in 2019-nCoV S protein may increase the cleavage activity of<br/><br/>TMPRSS2 and enhance the viral infectivity, indicating that TMPRSS2 may serve as a candidate antiviral target for 2019-nCoV infection.<br/><br/>Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV utilizes ACE2 as a receptor for host cell entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. In human HeLa cells, expressing ACE2 from human, civet, and<br/><br/>Chinese horseshoe bat can help many kinds of SARSr-CoV enter into the cells including 2019-nCoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. During this process, the catalytic domain of ACE2 interacts with a defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) of CTD1 in S protein[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>].<br/><br/>The \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d transition of CTD1 allows ACE2 binding by regulating the relationship among CTD1, CTD2, S1-ACE2 complex and S2 subunit[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>].<br/><br/>In this study, we found a strong co-expression between ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The latter can cleave SARS-S near or at the cell surface along with another TTSP human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), also known as TMPRSS11D, and render host cell entry independent of the endosomal pathway using cathepsin B/L[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Different from cathepsin B/L, TMPRSS2 can also promote viral spread in the host [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. In addition, TMPRSS2 and HAT can also cleave ACE2 to augment about 30-fold viral infectivity and during this process, the metalloprotease ADAM17 can compete with TMPRSS2<br/><br/>[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. The detailed process is presented in Fig. 7. Due to the critical role of TMPRSS2 in influenza virus and coronavirus infections, serine protease inhibitors have been used in the antiviral therapeutic strategy targeting TMPRSS2 with high antiviral activities, such as camostat, nafamostat and leupeptin[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>].<br/><br/>The TTSPs showed similar substrate-specificity and catalytic mechanism. As a TTSP, TMPRSS2, located on the cell surface, includes extracellular domain, transmembrane domain and intracellular domain structurally, in which extracellular domain is the main catalytic domain. TMPRSS2 can catalyze the hydrolysis of substrate protein with a strong substrate specificity. Moreover, based on previous study, as for TTSP family members, the P1 position of the cleaved substrates is arginine[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. This is mainly determined by the special structure of its catalytic pocket. The catalytic pocket of TMPRSS2 is relatively deep, and its bottom has a negatively charged aspartic acid residue which can facilitate the binding and stabilization of the long-chain positively charged amino acid residue of substrate.<br/><br/>Generally, TMPRSS2 is shown to cleave SARS-S at residue R667 which is significantly associated with SARS-S activation for cell-cell fusion[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]. As the S1/S2 cleavage site, R667 is often embedded in different cleavage motifs and cleaved during<br/><br/>S protein biogenesis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. Besides R667, residue R797 is aslo required for S protein activation by TMPRSS2. As the S2\u2019 cleavage site, it is frequently cleaved during viral entry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. Both the hydrolysis sites of R667 and R797 are corresponding to the<br/><br/>SARS-S sequence tagged site.<br/><br/>Similar to SARS-S, the 2019-nCoV S protein has three arginine hydrolysis sites located on its surface (R685, R682 and R683), with two from the insertion sequence in 2019-nCoV S protein (680-SPRR-683). As we above-mentioned, the main hydrolysis site of TMPRSS2 is the long-chain positively charged amino acid residue represented by R and more R often increase the viral infectivity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. The insertion sequence of R682 and R683 was exposed from the molecular surface. Based on the catalytic mechanism of TMPRSS2, we supposed that the additional arginine residues linked structure exposed from protein surface may be more conducive to the recognition and cleavage activity of TMPRSS2, theraby enhancing the viral infectivity of 2019-nCoV.<br/><br/>Some researchers believed that there were four inserts in the S protein of 2019-nCoV, which may be the result of artificial modification. The SARS-S has been widely studied, including vaccine development and drug design[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. The key residues<br/><br/>663-VSLLRSTSQ-671 involved in SARS-S protein cleavage site was missed in all structures that have been resolved to date due to its flexibility. The reasonable modification of protein/enzyme function is to modify the key sites of protein/enzyme based on the existing structural studies. We can observe that in the key sequence of S protein splicing, 675-QTQTNSPRRARSVAS-679, only two bases of 685-RS-686 are same as SARS-S, which is most likely not designed for protein function."

Routes of coronavirus entering host cells. 2019-nCoV could enter host cells via two distinct routes, depending on the availability of cellular proteases required for activation of 2019-nCoV. The first route of activation can be achieved if the<br/><br/>2019-nCoV activating protease TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are co-expressed on the surface of target cells. The spiked protein binds to ACE2 through its S1 subunit and is treated by TMPRSS2 at the R667 or R797 in the S1/S2 site. This activates Spike protein and allows 2019-nCoV fusion at the cell surface. 2019-nCoV was encapsulated into cellular vesicles before transport of virions into host cell endosomes. Uptake can be enhanced if TMPRSS2 also cleaves ACE2 amino acids 697 to 716, resulting in shedding of 13kD ACE2 fragment in culture supernatants. The second route can be pursued if there were no 2019-nCoV activating proteases expressed at the cell surface.<br/><br/>While binding of virion-associated Spike protein to ACE2, the virions are taken up into endosomes, where 2019-nCoV could be cleaved and activated by the pH-dependent protease.<br/><br/>(B). The difference between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV in activating the Spike protein. The Spike protein of SARS involves two cleavage sites recognized by<br/><br/>TMPRSS2, one at arginine 667 and one at arginine 797. (right). Compared with<br/><br/>SARS-Cov, the S protein of 2019-nCoV (left)has an insertion sequence<br/><br/>680-SPRR-683 (grey box)at the TM cleavage site. We speculated that R682, R682 and R685 (red box) could be used as the most suitable substrates for TM, which can increase the cleavage efficiency of TM to S protein, promote the activation of<br/><br/>2019-nCoV, and make 2019-nCoV more infectious."

            "In December 2019, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) induced an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China. It enters into host cell via cellular receptor recognization and membrane fusion. The former is based on angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). In the latter process, type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) play important roles in spike protein cleavage and activation. In this study, we used the single-cell transcriptomes of normal human lung and gastroenteric system to identify the ACE2- and TTSP-coexpressing cell composition and proportion. The results revealed that TMPRSS2 was highly co-expressed with",
            "ACE2 in the absorptive enterocytes, upper epithelial cells of esophagus and lung AT2 cells, implying the important role of TMPRSS2 in 2019-nCoV infection. Additionally, sequence and structural alignment showed that 675-QTQTNSPRRARSVAS-679 was the key sequence mediating 2019-nCoV spike protein, and there was a inserted sequence (680-SPRR-683). We speculated that this insertion sequence especially the exposed structure at R682 and R683 may enhance the recognition and cleavage activity of TMPRSS2 and then increase its viral infectivity. In conclusion, this study provides the bioinformatics and structure evidence for the increased viral infectivity of 2019-nCoV and indicates transmembrane serine protease inhibitors as the antiviral treatment options for 2019-nCoV infection targeting TMPRSS2."

            "As a human coronavirus (HCoV), its prerequisite of infection is entering host cells.",
            "During this process, the spike (S) glycoprotein of HCoV plays an important role[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",
            "The surface unit (S1) of S protein mediates the entry into host cells by binding to cellular receptor and the transmembrane unit (S2) subunit harbors the functional elements for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. It should be noted that the cleavage of S protein is priming to be activated which is essential for viral infectivity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Thus, this process not only needs virus-binding components (cell receptors), but also requires virus protein-cleaving components (cell proteases)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].",
            "In 2019-nCoV infection, a metallopeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)",

            "The coronaviruses is the common infection source of enteric, respiratory, and central nervous system in humans and other mammals[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, two betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, result in persistent public panics and became the most significant public health events[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. In",
            "December 2019, a novel identified coronavirus (2019-nCoV) induced an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Till now, the pathogenic mechanism of 2019-nCoV is still unclear. In this study, we found the high co-expression between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the absorptive enterocytes, upper epithelial cells of esophagus and lung AT2 cells. Additionally, the insertion sequence (680-SPRR-683) in 2019-nCoV S protein may increase the cleavage activity of",
            "TMPRSS2 and enhance the viral infectivity, indicating that TMPRSS2 may serve as a candidate antiviral target for 2019-nCoV infection.",
            "Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV utilizes ACE2 as a receptor for host cell entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. In human HeLa cells, expressing ACE2 from human, civet, and",

During this process, the catalytic domain of ACE2 interacts with a defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) of CTD1 in S protein[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>].",

            "In this study, we found a strong co-expression between ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The latter can cleave SARS-S near or at the cell surface along with another TTSP human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), also known as TMPRSS11D, and render host cell entry independent of the endosomal pathway using cathepsin B/L[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Different from cathepsin B/L, TMPRSS2 can also promote viral spread in the host [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. In addition, TMPRSS2 and HAT can also cleave ACE2 to augment about 30-fold viral infectivity and during this process, the metalloprotease ADAM17 can compete with TMPRSS2",
            "[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. The detailed process is presented in Fig. 7. Due to the critical role of TMPRSS2 in influenza virus and coronavirus infections, serine protease inhibitors have been used in the antiviral therapeutic strategy targeting TMPRSS2 with high antiviral activities, such as camostat, nafamostat and leupeptin[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>].",
            "The TTSPs showed similar substrate-specificity and catalytic mechanism. As a TTSP, TMPRSS2, located on the cell surface, includes extracellular domain, transmembrane domain and intracellular domain structurally, in which extracellular domain is the main catalytic domain. TMPRSS2 can catalyze the hydrolysis of substrate protein with a strong substrate specificity. Moreover, based on previous study, as for TTSP family members, the P1 position of the cleaved substrates is arginine[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. This is mainly determined by the special structure of its catalytic pocket. The catalytic pocket of TMPRSS2 is relatively deep, and its bottom has a negatively charged aspartic acid residue which can facilitate the binding and stabilization of the long-chain positively charged amino acid residue of substrate.",
            "Generally, TMPRSS2 is shown to cleave SARS-S at residue R667 which is significantly associated with SARS-S activation for cell-cell fusion[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]. As the S1/S2 cleavage site, R667 is often embedded in different cleavage motifs and cleaved during",

As the S2\u2019 cleavage site, it is frequently cleaved during viral entry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. Both the hydrolysis sites of R667 and R797 are corresponding to the",
            "SARS-S sequence tagged site.",
            "Similar to SARS-S, the 2019-nCoV S protein has three arginine hydrolysis sites located on its surface (R685, R682 and R683), with two from the insertion sequence in 2019-nCoV S protein (680-SPRR-683). As we above-mentioned, the main hydrolysis site of TMPRSS2 is the long-chain positively charged amino acid residue represented by R and more R often increase the viral infectivity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. The insertion sequence of R682 and R683 was exposed from the molecular surface. Based on the catalytic mechanism of TMPRSS2, we supposed that the additional arginine residues linked structure exposed from protein surface may be more conducive to the recognition and cleavage activity of TMPRSS2, theraby enhancing the viral infectivity of 2019-nCoV.",
            "Some researchers believed that there were four inserts in the S protein of 2019-nCoV, which may be the result of artificial modification. The SARS-S has been widely studied, including vaccine development and drug design[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. The key residues",
            "663-VSLLRSTSQ-671 involved in SARS-S protein cleavage site was missed in all structures that have been resolved to date due to its flexibility. The reasonable modification of protein/enzyme function is to modify the key sites of protein/enzyme based on the existing structural studies. We can observe that in the key sequence of S protein splicing, 675-QTQTNSPRRARSVAS-679, only two bases of 685-RS-686 are same as SARS-S, which is most likely not designed for protein function."

            "ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly co-expressed to facilitate the entry of 2019-nCoV into host cells. In addition, the insertion sequence in 2019-nCoV S protein may increase the cleavage activity of TMPRSS2 and enhance the viral infectivity, indicating that transmembrane serine protease inhibitors may serve as the antiviral treatment options for 2019-nCoV infection targeting TMPRSS2.",

It should be noted that the 9 cleavage of S protein is priming to be activated which is essential for viral infectivity 10 [5]. Thus, this process not only needs virus-binding components (cell receptors), but 11 also requires virus protein-cleaving components (cell proteases)[6]. 12 In 2019-nCoV infection, a metallopeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) 13 is proved to be the cellular receptor, same as SARS-CoV infection[7, 8]. As the host 14 cell protease of ACE2, the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as 15 TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D, can cleave and activate the SARS-CoV S protein 16 (SARS-S) for membrane fusion and also cleave ACE2 to promote viral uptake [9, 10].",
