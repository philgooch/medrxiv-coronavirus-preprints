        "abstract": "Introduction. Influenza epidemics and pandemics cause significant morbidity and mortality. An effective response to a potential pandemic requires the infrastructure to rapidly detect, characterize, and potentially contain new and emerging influenza strains at a population level. The objective of this study is to use data gathered simultaneously from community and hospital sites to develop a model of how influenza enters and spreads in a population.",

            "<strong>Methods and Analysis</strong><br/><br/>Starting in the 2018-19 season, we have been enrolling individuals with acute respiratory illness from community sites throughout the Seattle metropolitan area, including clinics, childcare facilities, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, workplaces, college campuses, and homeless shelters. At these sites, we collect clinical data and mid-nasal swabs from individuals with at least two acute respiratory symptoms. Additionally, we collect residual nasal swabs and data from individuals who seek care for respiratory symptoms at four regional hospitals. Samples are tested using a multiplex molecular assay, and influenza whole genome sequencing is performed for samples with influenza detected. Geospatial mapping and computational modeling platforms are in development to characterize the regional spread of influenza and other respiratory pathogens.<br/><br/>Ethics and Dissemination. The study was approved by the University of Washington\u2019s Institutional Review Board. Results will be disseminated through talks at conferences, peerreviewed publications, and on the study website (www.seattleflu.org).<br/><br/>Article Summary: Strengths and limitations of this study - Large-scale multiple-arm study of respiratory illness characterization with collection of samples from individuals in the community as well as in ambulatory care and hospital settings - Integration of sociodemographic, clinical, and geospatial data on a regional level - Multiplex molecular testing for multiple viral and bacterial pathogens and whole genome sequencing of influenza for detailed molecular epidemiologic characterization and transmission mapping - Geographically and socioeconomically diverse sampling of community-based acute respiratory illnesses",
            "<strong>Methods and Analysis</strong><br/><br/>Study design The Seattle Flu Study is a multi-armed surveillance study. The arms include [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] community cross-sectional, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] clinical cross-sectional, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] prospective clinical cohort, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] prospective childcare cohort, and [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] active clinical surveillance. This protocol describes the Seattle Flu Study as implemented in Year 1. Sub-studies and modifications in future years will be described in subsequent publications.<br/><br/>Study overview and setting In this study, participants are eligible if they have two or more acute respiratory illness (ARI)associated symptoms (Table 1) or a medically-collected respiratory specimen. The presence of a subjective or objective fever is not required. All participants have a respiratory specimen collected that is linked with demographic information, illness characteristics, behavioral, and other clinical metadata. The primary outcome is influenza infection status as defined by molecular diagnostic testing. The study takes place during influenza season (October to May) annually, starting with 2018-2019.<br/><br/>The study occurs in a variety of settings throughout the Seattle metropolitan area (Figure 3). Participants in the community cross-sectional arm are recruited at standalone kiosks in public settings including clinical facilities, university campuses, airports, workplaces, homeless shelters, and high-traffic tourist areas. Participants in the clinical cross-sectional and prospective clinical cohort arms are recruited from traditional sites of care such as hospitals and medical clinics. Participants in the prospective childcare cohort arm are recruited from childcare facilities. All collection sites are located in the greater Seattle metropolitan area, including King, Pierce, Snohomish, Skagit, and Island Counties, Washington, USA.<br/><br/>The community cross-sectional arm enrolls individuals with two or more protocol-defined respiratory symptoms (Table 1). One mid-nasal swab is collected at the time of enrollment and linked with questionnaire data. These individuals do not have follow up. Individuals are eligible to re-enroll for new ARI episodes every 14 days.

            "All study respiratory specimens are aliquoted in triplicate and barcoded using a unique identifier that can be linked back to the participant or site of collection. Samples were frozen at -80 \u030aC until thawed for extraction (Figure 2). Total nucleic acids are extracted from 200 \u03bcl of UTM using Magna Pure 96 small total nucleic acids extraction kit (Roche). Extracted nucleic acids are screened for the presence of respiratory pathogens by TaqMan RT-PCR on the OpenArray platform (Thermo) (Table 2). Specimens that test positive for influenza by RT-PCR are then sequenced using a modified oligo capture protocol. Total RNA is converted to cDNA and sequencing libraries are constructed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep for Enrichment kit, as outlined by the manufacturer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Library samples are ranked by TaqMan CRT value, and 24 samples with similar CRT values are pooled prior to oligo capture. CRT values are further used to determine the viral load of each sample and inform the fraction of each capture pool that a given sample represents. Each pool of flu-positive samples is hybridized overnight to a custom pool of capture oligonucleotides following the manufacturer\u2019s recommended protocol (Twist Bioscience, San Francisco, CA). Final libraries are sequenced on the Illumina Miseq, NextSeq or NovaSeq platform with paired end 150bp reads.",
            "Prevalence of respiratory pathogens are analyzed as the number of cases detected out of the total number of episodes with testing. For influenza-specific analyses, prevalence is defined as the number of cases of influenza out of the total number of episodes with testing. Risk ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals are estimated for the cross-sectional study arms using Poisson or negative binomial regression. Similarly, risk ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals are estimated for the prospective clinical and childcare cohorts. For questionnaire data, descriptive statistics are calculated and association with respiratory pathogen prevalence analyzed using parametric and nonparametric tests, as appropriate given the distributions. Geospatial incidence maps are estimated using generalized additive mixed models with spatial, temporal, age, and non-structured random effects [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Phylogenetic analyses are based on the Nextstrain pipeline [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].<br/><br/>For longitudinal data such as viral kinetics, we are conducting a descriptive analysis of group means over time and using mixed models, general estimating equations, and quantile regression to assess for change over time, adjusting for potential confounders, including age, comorbidities, and vaccination status.<br/><br/>Missing data For questionnaire data in the cross-sectional study, we do not anticipate substantial missing data because completion of the survey is a criterion for participation, though participants can state that they prefer not to answer specific questions. For longitudinal data, we are using complete case analysis. For analyses and subgroups where complete case analysis leads to loss of 10% or more of subjects, we are performing multiple imputation and sensitivity analyses.<br/><br/>Subgroup analyses The main subgroups of interest are age, recruitment site (homeless shelter, childcare, clinical, other) and vaccination status.<br/><br/>Ethics and Dissemination<br/><br/>Monitoring The Seattle Flu Study has a scientific advisory board to which it reports bi-annually. These reports include updates on enrollment, preliminary results, sub-studies, and protocol modifications.<br/><br/>Assessment of harms and adverse events Participants receive contact information from the study team and are encouraged to contact the team if they experience any participation-related. Given the minimally-invasive nature of the sample collection procedure, harms and adverse events are very unlikely. Should any significant adverse events arise related to the study procedures, they will be reported to institutional authorities at University of Washington and any applicable participating site.<br/><br/>Informed consent All participants in the community cross-sectional and prospective arms are informed about the study purpose, risks, and benefits, and they or their LAR provide written informed consent via an electronic consent form prior to study participation. US Flu VE Network enrollees provide informed verbal consent for respiratory swab collection and informed written consent if providing blood. Participants are informed during the consent process that they may withdraw from the study at any time.<br/><br/>Access to data The data will be accessed only by authorized individuals on the study team. Access to deidentified, aggregated data and analysis code will be publicly available on the study web page (www.seattleflu.org).<br/><br/>Dissemination plans Our study group will present the results at national and international research conferences and through peer-reviewed publications and on the study website (www.SeattleFlu.org).

            "In the United States, annual influenza epidemics cause 9-45 million illnesses, 140,000-810,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000-67,000 deaths. The 1918 pandemic, the worst for which reliable records exist, resulted in an estimated 675,000 deaths in the United States and 50 million worldwide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. More recently, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused 12,500 deaths and 60.8 million infections in the United States, with an estimated global burden of 284,500 deaths [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].<br/><br/>Active surveillance for influenza is essential to monitor the impact of seasonal influenza and to detect and characterize emerging influenza viruses. In the United States, surveillance systems rely primarily on medically-attended illnesses. This underestimates true influenza-related disease burden by 50% or more [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Individuals may not seek care, diagnostic tests are often underutilized in the community, and hospitalizations may be attributed to chronic conditions exacerbated by influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Furthermore, recent studies have estimated that 20% of individuals with influenza infection are asymptomatic but contribute to community transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].<br/><br/>Community-wide studies provide a mechanism to identify influenza among individuals who do not present for care and who may provide the first signal of an impending pandemic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Previous community-wide studies of influenza, including family-based prospective studies, conducted in the 20th century, have provided important data on transmission dynamics, including the role of households and schools in driving seasonal epidemics. More recent prospective studies employing molecular detection methods have highlighted the role of asymptomatic individuals in disease transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. However, a common limitation of community-based studies is they do not routinely integrate their data with inpatient hospital and ambulatory care surveillance to understand the transmission and burden of influenza at a population level within a specific geographic area.<br/><br/>Despite substantial progress in the estimation of the burden of influenza through large-scale surveillance studies, there is an ongoing need for improved near-real-time monitoring that is coupled to pandemic preparedness. We envision that pandemic control will require the rapid accrual of actionable information from a diversity of sources. For example, rapid genome sequencing of influenza strains throughout a city could feed the creation of actionable maps that identify new and emerging influenza strains their transmission dynamics. With such a system in place, we can more effectively develop and test strategies to rapidly deploy vaccines, antivirals, and non-pharmaceutical interventions to areas with early influenza detection. This combination of rapid detection and deployment of interventions may provide a new paradigm to contain outbreaks.<br/><br/>This manuscript describes the protocol for the Seattle Flu Study (SFS), a multi-armed regional study of influenza at a city-wide scale that integrates community, ambulatory care, and inpatient surveillance at unprecedented intensity. The objectives of this study are to gather data from community and hospital sites to advance our understanding of how influenza enters and spreads in a population, as well as to create a city-wide platform for testing novel interventions that may limit or contain influenza outbreaks."

Persons who consent to the trial, but who do not want their biospecimens stored may still participate in the trial. Their biospecimens are tested as per protocol, but the remaining aliquots will be destroyed.",
            "Identifiers are kept on all data files until the study is closed out. Primary data collection sources will be kept for at least 5 years following the publication of the primary result from this study. Once this time elapses and the electronic data files are fully cleaned, any paper forms will be destroyed.",

Hard copies of data collection materials that have identifiers will be locked in the office of the study PI or a room with limited access by specific individuals. When possible, redacted (de-identified) versions of the data will be used for coding and data analysis. Personal identifiers will be stored in the database on a password protected network that is HIPAA-compliant, and only accessible to specific individuals.

            "Respiratory specimens Prospectively collected respiratory specimens are collected using a sterile Copan flocked respiratory swab inserted and rotated mid-nasally. Respiratory specimens are transported to the research laboratory in Universal Viral Transport Medium (UTM, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin, NJ). Clinically-collected respiratory specimens are obtained from each participating hospital or clinic laboratory, maintained at 4C, and transported to the research laboratory within 3-7 days of specimen collection on wet ice (Figure 2).",
            "Environmental samples Both bioaerosol and surface samples are collected longitudinally at select community crosssectional and prospective childcare cohort sites. Prespecified high-touch surfaces are sampled by wiping a designated object or 10 cm2 area with a synthetic polyester swab and transported to the lab in UTM. Bioaerosol samples are collected over a 90-minute sampling period using an SKC QuickTake 30 Air Pump at prespecified locations with high foot traffic and low air ventilation at select community sites. These samples are collected on membrane filter paper inside the air pump. Environmental samples undergo the specimen handling procedures as above.",
            "Laboratory methods All study respiratory specimens are aliquoted in triplicate and barcoded using a unique identifier that can be linked back to the participant or site of collection. Samples were frozen at -80 \u030aC until thawed for extraction (Figure 2). Total nucleic acids are extracted from 200 \u03bcl of UTM using Magna Pure 96 small total nucleic acids extraction kit (Roche). Extracted nucleic acids are screened for the presence of respiratory pathogens by TaqMan RT-PCR on the OpenArray platform (Thermo) (Table 2). Specimens that test positive for influenza by RT-PCR are then sequenced using a modified oligo capture protocol. Total RNA is converted to cDNA and sequencing libraries are constructed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep for Enrichment kit, as outlined by the manufacturer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Library samples are ranked by TaqMan CRT value, and 24 samples with similar CRT values are pooled prior to oligo capture. CRT values are further used to determine the viral load of each sample and inform the fraction of each capture pool that a given sample represents. Each pool of flu-positive samples is hybridized overnight to a custom pool of capture oligonucleotides following the manufacturer\u2019s recommended protocol (Twist Bioscience, San Francisco, CA). Final libraries are sequenced on the Illumina Miseq, NextSeq or NovaSeq platform with paired end 150bp reads.",
            "Statistical methods Prevalence of respiratory pathogens are analyzed as the number of cases detected out of the total number of episodes with testing. For influenza-specific analyses, prevalence is defined as the number of cases of influenza out of the total number of episodes with testing. Risk ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals are estimated for the cross-sectional study arms using Poisson or negative binomial regression. Similarly, risk ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals are estimated for the prospective clinical and childcare cohorts. For questionnaire data, descriptive statistics are calculated and association with respiratory pathogen prevalence analyzed using parametric and nonparametric tests, as appropriate given the distributions. Geospatial incidence maps are estimated using generalized additive mixed models with spatial, temporal, age, and non-structured random effects [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Phylogenetic analyses are based on the Nextstrain pipeline [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].",

            "Missing data For questionnaire data in the cross-sectional study, we do not anticipate substantial missing data because completion of the survey is a criterion for participation, though participants can state that they prefer not to answer specific questions. For longitudinal data, we are using complete case analysis. For analyses and subgroups where complete case analysis leads to loss of 10% or more of subjects, we are performing multiple imputation and sensitivity analyses.",
            "Subgroup analyses The main subgroups of interest are age, recruitment site (homeless shelter, childcare, clinical, other) and vaccination status.",
            "Monitoring The Seattle Flu Study has a scientific advisory board to which it reports bi-annually. These reports include updates on enrollment, preliminary results, sub-studies, and protocol modifications.",
            "Assessment of harms and adverse events Participants receive contact information from the study team and are encouraged to contact the team if they experience any participation-related. Given the minimally-invasive nature of the sample collection procedure, harms and adverse events are very unlikely. Should any significant adverse events arise related to the study procedures, they will be reported to institutional authorities at University of Washington and any applicable participating site.",
            "Informed consent All participants in the community cross-sectional and prospective arms are informed about the study purpose, risks, and benefits, and they or their LAR provide written informed consent via an electronic consent form prior to study participation. US Flu VE Network enrollees provide informed verbal consent for respiratory swab collection and informed written consent if providing blood.

            "Rapid genome sequencing of influenza strains throughout a city could feed the creation of actionable maps that identify new and emerging influenza strains their transmission dynamics",
            "With such a system in place, the authors can more effectively develop and test strategies to rapidly deploy vaccines, antivirals, and non-pharmaceutical interventions to areas with early influenza detection.",
            "The objectives of this study are to gather data from community and hospital sites to advance the understanding of how influenza enters and spreads in a population, as well as to create a city-wide platform for testing novel interventions that may limit or contain influenza outbreaks"
        ],
        "Methods": [
            "<strong>Methods and Analysis</strong><br/><br/>Starting in the 2018-19 season, the authors have been enrolling individuals with acute respiratory illness from community sites throughout the Seattle metropolitan area, including clinics, childcare facilities, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, workplaces, college campuses, and homeless shelters.",
            "The active clinical surveillance arm utilizes specimens collected at participating medical clinics as well as through the Washington site of the United States Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (US Flu VE Network), details of which have been previously published [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "In the US Flu VE Network, patients seeking ambulatory care for ARI are prospectively identified and recruited into the study, with collection of clinical data and a nasal swab.",
            "There are no current plans to involve participants in the study recruitment, conduct, analysis, or dissemination, though aggregate data will be made publicly available"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "The authors present the study design for large-scale assessment of the burden of ARI attributable to influenza and other respiratory pathogens to map the clinical and molecular epidemiology of influenza in a major metropolitan area.",
            "This will provide the framework for further studies of strategies for rapid, accurate identification and deployment of interventions to interrupt spread of infectious disease in major metropolitan areas"
