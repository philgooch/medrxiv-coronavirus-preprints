        "introduction": [
            "In an epidemic, symptomatic cases are the predominant focus of treatment and usually represent the bulk of reported cases. However, infected individuals who are asymptomatic yet infectious can be a critical factor in the spread of some pathogens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Asymptomatic individuals are hard to trace, unlikely to self-isolate, and are likely to retain normal social and travel patterns.<br/><br/>There is significant ongoing interest in asymptomatic infections in COVID-19 for two major reasons. First, the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic (see [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]) is critical to attempts to estimate the likely burden of severe outcomes (including mortality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]) when the virus spreads through a population. Second, understanding the possible role of transmission by asymptomatic individuals is crucial to planning surveillance and control efforts [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]."
        ],
        "methods": [
            "We model viral spread using a renewal-equation framework [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], which allows us to model the current incidence of infected individuals (i.e., the rate at which new infections occur in the population) as a function of previous incidence and how infectiousness of an infected individual varies over the course of their infection. We divide incidence i into two categories \u2013 ia and is \u2013 corresponding to incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. Newly infected individuals that are either asymptomatically or symptomatically infected can transmit the disease to others, but they differ in their intrinsic reproduction numbers, Ra and Rs, respectively, as well as intrinsic generation-interval distributions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], ga(\u03c4 ) and gs(\u03c4 ). Generation intervals, which are defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], depend on the natural history of infection: individuals with subclinical infections may have fast clearance and short generation intervals, or slow viral reproduction and long generation intervals (cf. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]). The shape of the generation-interval distribution characterizes the relationship between the epidemic growth rate r and the reproduction number [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].<br/><br/>Neglecting births and loss of immunity on the time scale of the outbreak, the dynamics of susceptibles and incidence are:"

        "results": [
            "We explore the effects of different assumptions about speed and effectiveness of asymptomatic transmission on the importance of asymptomatic transmission and estimates of the basic reproduction number R0, using a gamma assumption (see Methods). Across the range of parameters we explore, the intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z is similar to the realized proportion q (Figure 1A). As the relative mean generation interval of asymptomatic transmission, Ga/Gs, increases, q decreases because symptomatic cases are<br/><br/>Intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission, z Intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission, z    R0 = 2.5<br/><br/>A.

        ],
        "discussion": [
            "Much is still unknown about the time scale and effectiveness of asymptomatic transmission in COVID-19. Here we highlight the need to characterize the generation-interval distribution for asymptomatic transmission, and its consequences not only for contact tracing but for estimation of the basic reproduction number of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] and of the effective proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential-growth phase. Our reproductive number findings fit into a broader framework linking epidemic speed, strength, and generation intervals \u2013 for a given observed speed increases in the mean generation interval imply larger reproduction number [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].<br/><br/>If asymptomatic infections are more persistent than symptomatic ones, the mean generation interval for COVID-19 could be longer than estimated from symptomatic cases alone \u2013<br/><br/>possibly increasing R0 (Figure 1B). However, if asymptomatic cases tend to resolve quickly, then current estimates of R0 may be over-estimates of the underlying strength (Figure 1B), and asymptomatic cases may be driving a larger fraction of secondary cases than we would expect without accounting for their differences (Figure 1A). Note that cases do not have to be completely asymptomatic for our qualitative results to apply. People with mild symptoms unlikely to be diagnosed in a particular time and place (sometimes referred to as subclinical cases) are expected to affect transmission patterns in the same way."

        "I. INTRODUCTION": [
            "In an epidemic, symptomatic cases are the predominant focus of treatment and usually represent the bulk of reported cases. However, infected individuals who are asymptomatic yet infectious can be a critical factor in the spread of some pathogens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Asymptomatic individuals are hard to trace, unlikely to self-isolate, and are likely to retain normal social and travel patterns.",
            "There is significant ongoing interest in asymptomatic infections in COVID-19 for two major reasons. First, the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic (see [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]) is critical to attempts to estimate the likely burden of severe outcomes (including mortality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]) when the virus spreads through a population. Second, understanding the possible role of transmission by asymptomatic individuals is crucial to planning surveillance and control efforts [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
            "Here, we focus on a third effect. If asymptomatic cases are important for transmission, they also have the potential to affect estimates of key parameters of disease spread such as the basic reproduction number R0 (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]). Thus, we investigate the relationship between individual-level features of asymptomatic cases (e.g., the probability that an infection is asymptomatic, asymptomatic case duration, transmission by asymptomatic individuals) to dynamics at the population scale."
        ],
        "II. METHODS": [
            "We model viral spread using a renewal-equation framework [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], which allows us to model the current incidence of infected individuals (i.e., the rate at which new infections occur in the population) as a function of previous incidence and how infectiousness of an infected individual varies over the course of their infection. We divide incidence i into two categories \u2013 ia and is \u2013 corresponding to incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. Newly infected individuals that are either asymptomatically or symptomatically infected can transmit the disease to others, but they differ in their intrinsic reproduction numbers, Ra and Rs, respectively, as well as intrinsic generation-interval distributions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], ga(\u03c4 ) and",
            "gs(\u03c4 ). Generation intervals, which are defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], depend on the natural history of infection: individuals with subclinical infections may have fast clearance and short generation intervals, or slow viral reproduction and long generation intervals (cf. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]). The shape of the generation-interval distribution characterizes the relationship between the epidemic growth rate r and the reproduction number [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",
            "Neglecting births and loss of immunity on the time scale of the outbreak, the dynamics of susceptibles and incidence are:",
            "i(t) = RaS(t) ia(t \u2212 \u03c4 )ga(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 + RsS(t) is(t \u2212 \u03c4 )gs(\u03c4 )d\u03c4.",
            "where p is the proportion of incident cases that are asymptomatic: ia(t) = pi(t). The corresponding intrinsic generation-interval distribution of an average infected individual is given by: g(\u03c4 ) = zga(\u03c4 ) + (1 \u2212 z)gs(\u03c4 ),",
            "where we define the \u201cintrinsic\u201d proportion of asymptomatic transmission z as the relative contribution of asymptomatic cases to the basic reproduction number:",
            "z = pRa/R0.",
            "1 \u2212 z = (1 \u2212 p)Rs/R0.",
            "Yet, this information is not sufficient to disentangle the role of asymptomatic cases, i.e., what fraction of secondary cases can be ascribed to realized transmission from asymptomatic cases vs. symptomatic cases?",
            "The intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z is a useful benchmark, but does not necessarily reflect the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission, unless both types of infection have the same generation-interval distribution. The realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission, q at time t is given by:",
            "During the period of exponential growth, we assume S remains nearly constant, and i(t) is proportional to exp(rt), and simplify by recalling that ia(t) = pi(t), is(t) = (1 \u2212 p)i(t) such that:",
            "Here, \u03b4c for each of the two classes is the average \u201cdiscount\u201d of a new infection \u2013 the average relative contribution of a secondary infection to the epidemic, taking exponential growth into account: \u03b4c = exp(\u2212r\u03c4 )gc(\u03c4 )d\u03c4.",
            "\u03b4c < 1 and grows smaller as the generation interval grows longer. Thus, the realized proportion of asymptomatic infections will be increased (resp., decreased) if transmission is relatively faster (slower) along the asymptomatic route. The discount \u03b4 also depends on the relative variation in the generation-interval distribution, the \u201cdispersion\u201d: more variation in generation intervals leads to more opportunities for fast spread and thus to higher values of \u03b4 (similar to shorter average generation intervals).",
            "To estimate the effects of assumptions about asymptomatic transmission on the importance of asymptomatic transmission and estimates of the basic reproduction number R0, we parameterize the generation interval distributions of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases based on their means, Ga and Gs, and dispersions, \u03baa and \u03bas. We assume that generation intervals are gamma distributed, and we set the dispersion to be equal to the squared coefficient of variation (the reciprocal of the gamma shape parameter, see Supplementary",
            "Materials). We assume that epidemic growth rate r and the generation-interval distribution of symptomatic case are known, using parameter values that are consistent with earlier COVID-19 models [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]: 1/r = 7 days, Gs = 8 days, and \u03bas = 0.5. We infer values of q using Eq (8) and R0 using the Euler-Lotka equation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]:",
            "exp(\u2212r\u03c4 )g(\u03c4 )d\u03c4.",
            "In Supplementary Materials, we also use an ordinary differential equation model including both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases to give a concrete example of how differences in generation intervals affect both q and estimates of R0."
        ],
        "III. RESULTS": [
            "We explore the effects of different assumptions about speed and effectiveness of asymptomatic transmission on the importance of asymptomatic transmission and estimates of the basic reproduction number R0, using a gamma assumption (see Methods). Across the range of parameters we explore, the intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z is similar to the realized proportion q (Figure 1A). As the relative mean generation interval of asymptomatic transmission, Ga/Gs, increases, q decreases because symptomatic cases are",
            "Intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission, z Intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission, z"
        ],
        "A. Realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission": [],
        "B. Basic reproduction number": [
            "more likely to have short generation intervals (i.e., fast transmission events), which drive the spread during the growth phase (Figure 1A).",
            "Figure 1B shows the effect of different assumptions about the generation interval of asymptomatic cases, Ga, on the basic reproduction number R0. When Ga is long compared to Gs, then we are effectively assuming a longer mean for the overall generation interval. This assumption leads to a larger estimate of R0 for a fixed value of r (see [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]). Conversely, when Ga < Gs, generation intervals are shorter, leading to lower estimates of the epidemic strength R0. Both of these effects are stronger when the intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z increases (and disappear as z \u2192 0). Therefore, when R0 is estimated without explicitly accounting for asymptomatic spread (white, dashed line in Figure 1B), it can be over- or under- estimated depending on the relative duration of infection between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The qualitative effects of z and Ga/Gs on q and R0 remain robust when we assume narrower (\u03bas = \u03baa = 0.3; Figure S1) or wider (\u03bas = \u03baa = 0.8; Figure S2) generation intervals.",
            "Relative generation-interval dispersion of asymptomatic cases \u03baa/\u03bas have similar, but smaller, effects on q and R0 (Figure S3). Since a wider generation-interval distribution has a higher proportion of early transmission than a narrow one, increasing the generationinterval dispersion has qualitatively similar effects on q and R0 as decreasing the mean generation interval."
        ],
        "IV. DISCUSSION": [
            "Much is still unknown about the time scale and effectiveness of asymptomatic transmission in COVID-19. Here we highlight the need to characterize the generation-interval distribution for asymptomatic transmission, and its consequences not only for contact tracing but for estimation of the basic reproduction number of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] and of the effective proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential-growth phase. Our reproductive number findings fit into a broader framework linking epidemic speed, strength, and generation intervals \u2013 for a given observed speed increases in the mean generation interval imply larger reproduction number [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "If asymptomatic infections are more persistent than symptomatic ones, the mean generation interval for COVID-19 could be longer than estimated from symptomatic cases alone \u2013",
            "possibly increasing R0 (Figure 1B). However, if asymptomatic cases tend to resolve quickly, then current estimates of R0 may be over-estimates of the underlying strength (Figure 1B), and asymptomatic cases may be driving a larger fraction of secondary cases than we would expect without accounting for their differences (Figure 1A). Note that cases do not have to be completely asymptomatic for our qualitative results to apply. People with mild symptoms unlikely to be diagnosed in a particular time and place (sometimes referred to as subclinical cases) are expected to affect transmission patterns in the same way.",
            "We focus here on the exponential phase, so it is worth noting that the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission q is time-dependent, varying with dynamic changes in incidence and proportion susceptible. Future work might also consider the ways in which asymptomatic individuals can modulate the catalysis of epidemics in a networked metapopulation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Characterizing the role of asymptomatic individuals in driving the persistence of the epidemic will be critical for assessing the post-pandemic outcome [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]."
