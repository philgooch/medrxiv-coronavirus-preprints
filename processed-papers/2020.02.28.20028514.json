        "abstract": "Aim: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the most severe public health issue all over the world. Despite acute respiratory failure, liver dysfunction has also been observed in clinical settings This study aimed to investigate the factors involved with hepatic injury in COVID-19 patients.\nMethods: A total of 26 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 treated at Beijing Youan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to the diagnostic criteria, they were divided into mild group (n=3), ordinary group (n=6), serious group (n=11) and critical group (n=6). Blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation test, liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactic acid, cardiac markers and arterial partial pressure was compared between these groups. Independent risk factors of ALT increase was selected.\nResults:There were 8 patients with ALT elevation in the patients with COVID-19, accounting for 30.8% (8/26). There was no difference in sex ratio between normal and elevated ALT population, and there was an increasing trend in age. The CRP index was significantly higher in the population with elevated ALT, and the increase of CRP was independently related to ALT level, and the OR value was 1.023 (P = 0.024).\nConclusions: COVID-19 related hepatic injury may be a result of cytokine storm syndrome, a positive correlative relationship between the increase of CRP and liver injury. Early detection and timely treatment of hepatic injury is necessary.",

            "Our study reported on the factors involved with hepatic injury in COVID-19 patients. It was noticed for the first time that the injury was closely related to CRP, indicative of an inflammatory response. This discovery gave new evidence for the mechanism of COVID-19 patient\u2019s hepatic injury.<br/><br/>As the number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection continues to rise, it is apparent that, similar to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), COVID-19 mainly causes pulmonary symptoms, but may simultaneously lead to the injury of non-pulmonary organs including the liver, kidneys and cardiac muscle[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. A recent study published in The Lancet revealed that 43 out of 99 COVID-19 cases from the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital had shown transaminase elevation (ALT or AST elevation), with one patient suffering severe hepatic injury (ALT 7590 U/L, AST 1445 U/L)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].<br/><br/>, However no further research or explanation had been provided. The latest research from the Liver Cancer Institute at Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University has shown that bile duct cell has high specific expression of coronavirus receptor ACE-2 and low expression of hepatocytes, indicating the capability of COVID-19 to bind to ACE-2 positive bile duct cells directly, leading to the dysfunction of the bile duct, while biliary epithelial cell plays a key role in liver regeneration and immunoreaction[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Additionally, most scholars believe that cytokine storm syndrome (CCS) and drug-induced liver injury may be the main mechanism behind hepatic injury. The Lancet also recently published a case report authored by Dr. Fusheng Wang\u2019s team from the Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital ( 302 Hospital ). On January 27 2020, Dr. Wang\u2019s team performed a pathological autopsy on a deceased COVID-19 patient. According to their report, the patient\u2019s liver biopsy specimen revealed medium microvascular lipoid degeneration and active inflammation in the hepatic lobule portal area[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Due to the usage of interferon \u03b1-2b, lopinavir/ritonavir on the patient as treatment, there is difficulty in distinguishing within the pathological report whether the hepatic injury was caused by COVID-19 or a result of drug-induced liver injury."

The average age of the patients with COVID-19 was 65.81 years old, the sex ratio was similar. The average ALT value was 37.31U/L, and the AST level slightly increased. The average value of total bilirubin and direct bilirubin were in the normal range. The average level of creatinine was normal. C-reactive protein increased significantly, the average value of lymphocyte was close to the normal low value. The average value of creatine kinase was normal. In terms of clinical classification, the proportion of severe patients was 42.3%, followed by common and critical patients. At the same time, the patient had no history of liver disease.",
            "Characteristics of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 The results were shown in Table 2. There were 8 patients with ALT elevation in the whole population, accounting for 30.8% (8/26). There was no difference in sex ratio between normal and elevated ALT population, and there was an increasing trend in age. The bilirubin level was normal between the two groups. However, the CRP index was significantly higher in the population with elevated ALT. At the same time, neutrophils also increased. There was no significant difference in clinical classification between the two groups, however, the results showed that the proportion of severe patients in the ALT increased group was higher, reaching 62.5%.",
            "The factor related to ALT elevation in Multivariate analysis The CRP and neutrophils with significant differences in the univariate analysis were analyzed in logistic regression. It was found that the increase of CRP was independently related to ALT level, and the OR value was 1.023 (P = 0.024)."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "Our study reported on the factors involved with hepatic injury in COVID-19 patients. It was noticed for the first time that the injury was closely related to CRP, indicative of an inflammatory response. This discovery gave new evidence for the mechanism of COVID-19 patient\u2019s hepatic injury.",
            "As the number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection continues to rise, it is apparent that, similar to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), COVID-19 mainly causes pulmonary symptoms, but may simultaneously lead to the injury of non-pulmonary organs including the liver, kidneys and cardiac muscle[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. A recent study published in The Lancet revealed that 43 out of 99 COVID-19 cases from the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital had shown transaminase elevation (ALT or AST elevation), with one patient suffering severe hepatic injury (ALT 7590 U/L, AST 1445 U/L)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].",
            ", However no further research or explanation had been provided. The latest research from the Liver Cancer Institute at Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University has shown that bile duct cell has high specific expression of coronavirus receptor ACE-2 and low expression of hepatocytes, indicating the capability of COVID-19 to bind to ACE-2 positive bile duct cells directly, leading to the dysfunction of the bile duct, while biliary epithelial cell plays a key role in liver regeneration and immunoreaction[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Additionally, most scholars believe that cytokine storm syndrome (CCS) and drug-induced liver injury may be the main mechanism behind hepatic injury. The Lancet also recently published a case report authored by Dr. Fusheng Wang\u2019s team from the Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital ( 302 Hospital ). On January 27 2020, Dr. Wang\u2019s team performed a pathological autopsy on a deceased COVID-19 patient. According to their report, the patient\u2019s liver biopsy specimen revealed medium microvascular lipoid degeneration and active inflammation in the hepatic lobule portal area[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Due to the usage of interferon \u03b1-2b, lopinavir/ritonavir on the patient as treatment, there is difficulty in distinguishing within the pathological report whether the hepatic injury was caused by COVID-19 or a result of drug-induced liver injury.",
            "Our research involved 26 COVID-19 patients, out of which, 8 patients with no underlying chronic liver disease developed hepatic injury while admitted (over the clinical course). The other 18 patients had no signs of hepatic injury. Among the 8 patients presenting with hepatic injury, one patient had moderate symptoms while seven were under clinical care, an indication that hepatic injury likely occurs in patients under critical care. This indication is consistent with Academician Nanshan Zhong and his team\u2019s recent clinical research on acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19, published in the form of preprint[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Their research, which involved the largest scale of data so far, discovered that the abnormal rate of ALT and AST among critical COVID-19 patients are evidently higher than those among the non-critical ( , , ; , , ) patients ALT 39.4% vs 18.2% P<0.001 AST 28.1% vs 19.8% P=0.043 .",
            "However, there was little statistical significance after we compared the two groups of our patients (P=0.338), which may be a result of the small number of samples.",
            "The hepatic injury of the patients was mainly reflected through mild and medium elevation of ALT and AST, while elevation in serum-bilirubin was a rare occurrence. In our research, the highest ALT (629U/L) and the highest AST(1912U/L) was from a patient under critical care and resulted in mortality. As the disease developed, ALT of most patients began to drop during the second week, while serum-bilirubin levels mostly remained consistent. Hence, the hepatic injury complication of COVID-19 patients can be considered as a temporary acute hepatic injury with a relatively rapid change of serum enzyme, most less than 200U/L, and with gradual recovery after one week. The combination of the preceding pathological report showing a medium microvascular lipoid degeneration, active inflammation in the hepatic lobule portal area, abnormal liver function and pathology strongly support the argument that the hepatic injury related to COVID-19 is an acute non-specific inflammation change.",
            "In addition, when comparing the two groups of patients by single parameter and multiple parameters, we found that COVID-19 related hepatic injury is closely related to cytokine storm syndrome. Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is an overactive inflammatory response of the human body caused by infectious or non-infectious disease, which involves a persistent activation and reproduction of several kinds of lymphocytes and macrophages that will secrete huge amount of cytokine[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. CSS is highly correlated to the pathogenicity of infectious diseases and the fatality rate of virus infections such as SARS11,12. CSS not only leads to pulmonary injury, but also the injury of non-pulmonary organs including the liver, kidneys and cardiac muscle. Because inflammatory cytokine is not listed as a routine test for admission, CRP can be used as a critical indicator of CSS. C reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein that rapidly increase in the presence of infection or tissue damage. CRP plays an important role in the body immune process by activating complement and enhancing phagocytosis, thereby eliminating pathogenic microorganisms and/or tissue cells that are damaged or necrotic. Our research revealed a positive correlative relationship between the increase of CRP and the increase of ALT, which signifies that COVID-19 related hepatic injury may be a result of CSS.",
            "Our study also observed the patients involved in our research had a decline in albumin levels, though there was no obvious decline rate difference between the hepatic injury group and the control group, indicating that the result was not related to hepatic injury. The observed decline of albumin was more likely due to the exuberant protein synthesis caused by COVID-19 patients\u2019 hyper metabolic state presenting with fever, malnutrition and low caloric intake, suggesting the likely importance of nutritional support therapy.",
            "There were some limitations in the study, most of patients are still in hospital, whose condition maybe change in follow-up. And the study has not included the final survival outcome. However, we focused on the early identification of critical cases for risk stratification and management. We expect the results can help alleviate the shortage of medical resources and manage liver injury in patients with COVID-19 infection.",
            "In conclusion, hepatic injury is a likely complication of COVID-19 infection, presenting with a mild or medium increase in transaminase and an abnormal level of bilirubin. Therefore, early detection and timely treatment of hepatic injury is necessary.",
