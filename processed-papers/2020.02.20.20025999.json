The generation of COVID-19-specific antibodies is essential for such tasks. Here we report that polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing animals with synthetic peptides corresponding to different areas of Nucleoprotein (N) of COVID-19. The specificities of the COVID-19 antibodies were assessed by Western Blot analysis against NPs from COVID-19, MERS and SARS. Antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry staining of the tissue sections from COVID-19 infected patient, as a potential diagnostic tool. A Sandwich ELISA kit was quickly assembled for quantitation of the virus/NP of COVID-19 concentrations in the vaccine preparations. Development of POCT is also aggressively undergoing.",

Pept-2 has only 70% identity to SARS\u2019s in amino acid composition but are not in continued sequence and the antibodies generated by Pept-2 will have the highest possibility to be COVID-19 specific.

            "Recently, a novel coronavirus, named COVID-19, broke out from Wuhan, China, had spread rapidly around the country and now the rest of world. The pneumonia symptoms manifested by this virus are similar to that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which lead to acute respiratory syndrome. Until Feb 14th, 2020, 63,932 people confirmed to be infected by COVID-19 with [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,596] deaths in China1. Comparatively, SARS-CoV infected a total of more than 8,000 persons with 774 deaths in 37 additional countries in 20032. More seriously, the infections among doctors and family clusters demonstrated that it could transmission among humans3-6, more aggressively than what were observed with the SARS outbreak in 2003. Making the issue even worse, the virus could be widely transmitted by asymptomatic virus-carriers to people in close contact7 and some of the patients will still carry the virus even after they recovered from the diseases. RT-PCR has been used since the first day to screen the suspected and now used for confirmation of diagnosis for COVID-19 infection due to the lack of immunologic diagnostic assays for the new virus8. Molecular diagnosis requires both special laboratory setting and very skilled laboratory personnel, which are both highly limited in Wuhan and the heavily hit surrounding epidemic areas. False negative rate was alarming at 30-40% with RT-PCR of throat swabs due to many different reasons. It is urgent to develop rapid, fast and simple screening tools to find the \u201cmoving source of virus\u201d and quarantine them.",
            "COVID-19 contains Nucleoprotein (N-protein), Spike glycoprotein (S-protein), Envelope protein (E-protein) and Membrane protein (M-protein)9. Ideally, developing antibody against the S protein will be the best approach since S plays very important roles in virus entering by binding to the target receptor on the cell surface. However, S protein is a heavily glycosylated protein10 and many groups have tried to express the COVID-19 S protein in mammalian cells with limited success. On the other hand, N-protein is produced at very high levels in the virus infected cells and is considered to be a good candidate for clinic diagnosis11.",

Pept-5 is 100% identical in COVID-19 and SARS, no homology with the rest 5 viruses. The other three sequences were selected based more on the specificity and immunogenicity other than the locations in the protein. Pept-2 has only 70% identity to SARS\u2019s in amino acid composition but are not in continued sequence and the antibodies generated by Pept-2 will have the highest possibility to be COVID-19 specific.

On the contrary, clone 3A3 and 1F7 reacted equally well to NPs from COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Clone 3A10 and 8C3 recognized NPs from COVID-19 and SARS, but not the one from MERS.
