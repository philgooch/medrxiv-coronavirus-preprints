We modeled the transmission process in Republic of Korea with a stochastic model and estimated the basic reproduction number R0 as 2.6 (95%CI: 2.3-2.9) and 3.2 (95%CI: 2.9-3.5), under the assumption that the exponential growth starting 31 January and 5 February, 2020, respectively. Estimates of dispersion term (k) were larger than 10 significantly, which implies few super-spreading events.",

Without public health control or self-protective measures, the epidemic was likely to grow in a relatively large rate. The R0 estimate and the rapid growth of epidemic curves both indicates the disease transmissibility. Thus, control measures as well as self-administered protective actions are crucial to reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19 and thus mitigate the outbreak size and prevent for further burden. Given the superspreading is unlikely to occur, we can be confident to control the COVID-19 outbreak by reducing the reproduction number to below unity."
