        "abstract": "The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we herein used a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potently inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging SARSr-CoVs.

            "In April of 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a priority list of pathogens, including Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Disease X, a disease with an epidemic or pandemic potential caused by an unknown pathogen1,2 (Fig.1a).<br/><br/>In late December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia with an unknown etiology in<br/><br/>Wuhan, China was considered as the first Disease X following the announcement by<br/><br/>WHO. Shortly thereafter, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, as denoted by WHO 3, was identified as the pathogen causing the coronavirus disease COVID-19<br/><br/>2019-nCoV with 79.5% and 96% sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a bat coronavirus, SL-CoV-RaTG13, respectively 6, was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the<br/><br/>Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of<br/><br/>Viruses (ICTV) 7, while, in the interim, it was renamed HCoV-19, as a common virus name, by a group of virologists in China 8-10.<br/><br/>As of 24 February 2020, a total of 79,331 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 2,618 deaths, were reported in China and 27 other countries serious threat to global public health and thus calling for the prompt development of specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics for treatment and prevention of COVID-19.    , posing a<br/><br/>Coronaviruses (CoVs), the largest RNA viruses identified so far, belonging to the<br/><br/>Coronaviridae family, are divided into 4 genera, \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b4- and \u03b3-coronaviruses, while the \u03b2-coronaviruses are further divided into A, B, C, and D lineages. The seven CoVs that can infect humans (HCoVs) include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in the \u03b1-coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage A, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage B (\u03b2-B coronaviruses), and MERS-CoV in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage C 6. To develop specific SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors, it is essential to study the fusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to that of SARS-CoV. Particularly, the spike (S) protein S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2, which mediates membrane fusion, has 89.8% sequence identity and 96.9% sequence similarity angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the receptor to infect human cells 6.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the ACE2-binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in<br/><br/>S1 subunit of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 10- to 20-fold higher than that of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV 12, which may contribute to the higher infectivity and transmissibility of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can mediate membrane fusion in a manner that exceeds the capacity of SARS-CoV.    to those of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV, and both of them utilize human<br/><br/>After binding of RBD in S1 subunit of S protein on the virion to the ACE2 receptor on the target cell, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) domains in its S2 subunit of S protein interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core, bringing viral and cellular membranes into close proximity for fusion and infection<br/><br/>SARS-CoV S proteins should also be compared in order to investigate the structural basis for membrane fusion mediated by their S proteins and thus set the stage for the rational design of coronavirus fusion inhibitors.<br/><br/>. Therefore, the 6-HB fusion core structure of SARS-CoV-2 and<br/><br/>In our previous studies, we designed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, targeting the HR1 domains of HCoV S proteins, which proved to be effective in inhibiting infection of 5 HCoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and 3<br/><br/>SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs). By intranasal application of this peptide, either pre- or post-challenge with a coronavirus, the treated mice were protected from<br/><br/>HCoV-OC43 or MERS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide has prophylactic and therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection14. Indeed, our recent studies have shown that EK1 peptide is effective against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection in a dose-dependent manner 15.<br/><br/>In this study, we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits much higher capacity of membrane fusion than SARS-CoV, suggesting that the fusion machinery of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 is an important target for development of coronavirus fusion inhibitors.<br/><br/>We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2's 6-HB core and identified several mutated amino acid residues in HR1 domain responsible for its enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. By conjugating the cholesterol molecule to the EK1 peptide, we found that one of the lipopeptides, EK1C4, exhibited highly potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection, about 240- and 150-fold more potent than EK1 peptide, respectively.<br/><br/>EK1C4 is also highly effective against in vitro and in vivo infection of some live<br/><br/>HCoVs, such as SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, suggesting potential for further development as pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based therapeutics and prophylactics for treatment and prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, as well as future reemerging SARS-CoV and emerging"

            "The capacity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion<br/><br/>From the GISAID Platform (https://platform.gisaid.org), we obtained the full-length amino-acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV 2019-2020) S protein (GenBank: QHD43416). Through alignment with SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs S proteins, we located the functional domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which contains S1 subunit and S2 subunit with the cleavage site at R685/S686 15. S1 subunit is located within the N-terminal 14\u2013685 amino acids of S protein, containing<br/><br/>N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor binding domain (RBD), and receptor binding motif (RBM). S2 subunit contains fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic domain (CP) (Fig. 1b).<br/><br/>Recent biophysical and structural evidence showed that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds hACE2 with 10-fold to 20-fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV S protein, suggesting the higher infectivity of the new virus 12. Unlike other \u03b2-B coronaviruses,<br/><br/>S protein of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a special S1/S2 furin-recognizable site, indicating that its S protein might possess some unique infectious properties. Indeed, in live<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found a typical syncytium phenomenon naturally formed by infected cells, which is rarely reported in SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 1c). To further explore the special characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we cloned the S gene into PAAV-IRES-GFP vector and established the S-mediated cell-cell fusion system, using 293T cells that express SARS-CoV-2 S protein and EGFP (293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP) as the effector cells, and ACE2/293T cells expressing human ACE2 receptor as the target cells (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1a). After effector cells and target cells were cocultured at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h, the fused cells showed at least 2-fold larger size than normal cells and multiple nuclei, and these cells were observed in the<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 group, but not the SARS-CoV group. After coincubation for 24 h, hundreds of target cells fused together as one big syncytium, containing multiple nuclei (Fig. 1d). Another 24h later, the syncytium grew bigger and could be easily observed under both light and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1e). Similar results were observed in the fusion between 293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP cells and Huh-7 cells, which naturally express human ACE2 receptor on the cell surface. Their syncytium was obviously formed after coincubation for 48 h, similar to the syncytium formed by live SARS-CoV-2-infected Huh-7 cells (Fig. 1c and 1f). On the contrary, SARS-CoV<br/><br/>S protein lacked the ability to mediate the cell-cell fusion under the same conditions (Fig. 1d) based on the required presence of exogenous trypsin to complete membrane fusion in our previous studies. Therefore, compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed much more efficiency in mediating viral surface-fusion and entry into target cells<br/><br/>S-expression or 293T cells without ACE2-expression (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1b), confirming that S-receptor engagement is necessary for the S-mediated viral fusion and entry.<br/><br/>X-ray crystallographic analysis of the 6-HB fusion core formed by HR1 and HR2 domains in S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein<br/><br/>. Meanwhile, no fusion was observed for 293T/EGFP cells without<br/><br/>Previously, we identified that the 6-HB formed by HR1 and HR2 domains of the<br/><br/>S2 subunit plays a very important role in the membrane fusion process mediated by<br/><br/>MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV S protein<br/><br/>HR1 and HR2 in subunit S2 of SARS-CoV-2 also interacted to form coiled-coil complex to support membrane fusion and viral infection15 (Fig. 2a and Fig. S2).<br/><br/>However, the specific binding characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 6-HB remained to be explored.<br/><br/>. Similarly, our recent study suggested that<br/><br/>To understand the structural basis of the interactions between HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV-2, a fusion protein containing the major parts of HR1 (residues to 988) and HR2 (residues 1162 to 1206) with a flexible linker (L6, SGGRGG) in between was constructed for crystallographic study. The crystal structure of<br/><br/>HR1-L6-HR2 shows a canonical 6-HB structure with a rod-like shape 115 \u00c5 in length and 25 \u00c5 in diameter (Fig. 2b). The three HR1 domains form a parallel trimeric coiled-coil center, around which three HR2 domains are entwined in an antiparallel manner. The interaction between these two domains is predominantly a hydrophobic force. Each pair of two adjacent HR1 helices forms a deep hydrophobic groove, providing the binding site for hydrophobic residues of the HR2 domain, including<br/><br/>V1164, L1166, I1169, I1172, A1174, V1176, V1177, I1179, I1183, L1186, V1189, L1193, L1197 and I1198 (Fig. 2c). The hydrophobic interactions between HR1 and<br/><br/>HR2 are mainly located in the helical fusion core region, which will be discussed later.<br/><br/>The overall 6-HB structure of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other HCoVs with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.36 \u00c5 to SARS-CoV 6-HB and 0.66 \u00c5 to MERS-CoV 6-HB for all the C\u03b1 atoms (Fig. 2d). This finding suggested that the overall 6-HB conformation is an important and highly conserved component for these dangerous coronaviruses. When comparing with the 6-HB of other common coronaviruses causing mild respiratory disease, such as 229E and NL63, the<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 6-HB has a similar overall structure, except for the different length of<br/><br/>HR2 helix in the 6-HB. The HR2 domain of 229E or NL63 forms a longer and bending helix to interact with trimeric HR1 core (Fig. 2e). The relationship between the structural difference and the pathogenicity of these HCoVs remains to be elucidated.<br/><br/>According to sequence alignment, the S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 and<br/><br/>SARS-CoV are highly conserved, with 92.6% and 100% overall homology in HR1 and HR2 domains, respectively. Inside the fusion core region of HR1 domain, there are 8 different residues (Fig. 3a), which may contribute the enhanced interactions between HR1 and HR2 and stabilize 6-HB conformation of SARS-CoV-2 as revealed by crystallographic analysis, compared with those of SARS-CoV. This significant difference has not been observed in other SARS-like viruses, such as WIV1, Rs3367, and RsSHC014. As shown in Figure 3b, the K911 in SARS-CoV HR1 could bind to<br/><br/>E1176 in HR2 through a salt bridge 2.9 \u00c5 in distance. However, with the Lys-Ser replacement, S929 in SARS-CoV-2 binds to S1196 through a strong hydrogen bond<br/><br/>2.4 \u00c5 in distance. In SARS-CoV, Q915 in the HR1 domain does not bind to the HR2 domain. However, with Q-K replacement in the new virus, K933 in the HR1 domain binds to carbonyl oxygen of N1172 in HR2 through a salt bridge 2.7 \u00c5 in distance (Fig. 3b). In SARS-CoV, E918 in the HR1 domain binds to R1166 in the HR2 domain through a weak salt bridge 3.7 \u00c5 in distance. In SARS-CoV-2, E918 is mutated to<br/><br/>D936 and binds to R1185 in the HR2 domain through a salt bridge 2.7 \u00c5 in distance (Fig. 3c). In SARS-CoV, K929 in HR1 binds to E1163 in HR2 through a salt bridge<br/><br/>3.2 \u00c5 in distance, while T925 is not involved in the interaction. However, when T925 was mutated to S943, it could bind to E1182 in the HR2 domain with a hydrogen bond 2.6 \u00c5 in distance, and K947 could also bind to E1182 through a salt bridge 3.0<br/><br/>\u00c5 in distance (Fig. 3d). These results suggested that the multiple replacements in the<br/><br/>HR1 domain of emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus could enhance the interactions between<br/><br/>HR1 and HR2 domain to further stabilize the 6-HB structure, which may lead to increased infectivity of the virus."

            "Over the past 20 years, highly infectious pathogens have been emerging increasingly, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012<br/><br/>WHO proposed \u201cDisease X\u201d in the blueprint priority diseases for any new unknown pathogen that may cause an epidemic or pandemic in the future, calling for the development of effective and safe vaccines and antivirals to prevent and treat such<br/><br/>Disease X. Indeed, at the end of 2019, the outbreak of Wuhan pneumonia with an unknown etiological agent, the first Disease X following WHO's announcement was reported to WHO. Shortly thereafter, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV or HCoV-19), was identified to be the etiology of the Wuhan pneumonia, i.e., COVID-19 as designated by WHO.<br/><br/>. In 2018, Unlike SARS-CoV, live SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were found to form typical syncytium, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may mainly utilize the plasma membrane fusion pathway to enter and replicate inside host cells. Consistently, in the cell-cell fusion system, SARS-CoV-2 S protein could effectively mediate the formation of syncytium between the effector cell and the target cell in the absence of an exogenous proteolytic enzyme, e.g., trypsin, while SARS-CoV S protein could not. Actually, the plasma membrane fusion pathway is more efficient than the endosomal membrane fusion pathway for most viruses because the latter is more prone to activating the host cell antiviral immunity23,24. Generally, \u03b2-B coronaviruses lack the S1/S2 furin-recognition site, and their S proteins are uncleaved in the native state. For example, SARS-CoV enters into the cell mainly via the endosomal membrane fusion pathway where its S protein is cleaved by endosomal cathepsin L and activated25.<br/><br/>Inducing the S1/S2 furin-recognition site could significantly increase the capacity of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV S protein to mediate cellular membrane surface infection 26. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 harbors the S1/S2 cleavage site in its S protein, but its specific role in S protein-mediated membrane fusion and viral life-cycle remains to be further explored (Fig. S7). A recent report suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mainly used TMPRSS2 for plasma membrane fusion; this means that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor might constitute an option for blocking SARS-CoV-2 fusion with and entry into the host cell 27.<br/><br/>The 6-HB structure formed by HR1 and HR2 regions in the S2 subunit of HCoVs plays a key role during the viral membrane fusion process, which makes it one of the most important targets for drug design. In previous studies, we have found that HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 could form a stable coiled-coil complex, but the detailed conformations remain unknown. According to the X-ray crystallographic analysis of the complex formed by HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2b), it is a typical 6-HB fusion core structure similar to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although the amino acid sequences of HR2 domain from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are fully identical, multiple residue differences occur in the HR1 domain of SARS-CoV-2.<br/><br/>However, instead of weakening the interaction between HR1 and HR2, such unilateral difference seems to form new interactions in some regions and enhance the existing ones in other regions (Fig. 3). When K991 in SARS-CoV HR1 was replaced with<br/><br/>S929 in SARS-CoV2 HR1, a new, strong hydrogen bond was formed with a distance of 2.4 \u00c5. K933 forms a new interaction with N1192 in SARS-CoV-2 with a distance of 2.7 \u00c5, whereas the corresponding position in SARS-CoV has no such interaction.<br/><br/>In the other two regions, E918 binds to R1166 and K929 binds to E1163 in<br/><br/>SARS-CoV, both of which were enhanced in SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that this new HCoV has evolved with improved binding affinity between HR1 and HR2 domains, which may accelerate the viral membrane fusion process and enhance viral infectivity or transmissibility. A recent study also found that the binding affinity between ACE2 receptor on the host cell and RBD in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more than 10-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, which may also be associated with the increased infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-212.<br/><br/>The conjugation of cholesterol to viral entry inhibitor has been proved to be an effective strategy to enhance the antiviral activity, such as C34 peptide for HIV-1<br/><br/>However, the mechanism of this enhancement, especially the role of cholesterol group in the C-terminal tail of entry inhibitor, is still unclear. There is a possibility that the cholesterol group could anchor to the target membrane to facilitate the binding of inhibitor to the HR1 targets. However, we noticed that binding affinity between<br/><br/>EK1C4 and SARS-CoV-2-HR1P is significantly enhanced than EK1 peptide alone, which suggested that cholesterol group may be involved in binding to HR1P directly (Fig. S4). Therefore, using structural simulation and docking method, we predicted a possible model of EK1C4 in binding with SARS-CoV-2 HR1P (Fig. S8). In this model, the EK1C4 peptide anchors to one of the three hydrophobic grooves of HR1 trimer via its EK1 moiety, and also anchors to another adjacent hydrophobic groove of<br/><br/>HR1 trimer via its cholesterol moiety. The cholesterol group of EK1C4 may bind to<br/><br/>HR1P through hydrophobic interactions, while several hydrogen bonds may form between HR1 and helical region of EK1C4. The intermediated GSGSG-PEG4 linker of EK1C4 peptide is just enough to connect these two moieties on the two binding targets. Admittedly, the exact mechanism and structure of EK1C4 need more studies in the future.<br/><br/>In the past few decades, the viral HR1 domain has been proved to be an important target for the development of viral fusion and entry inhibitors. In the early outbreak of<br/><br/>MERS, we quickly solved the 6-HB fusion core structure formed by MERS-CoV S protein HR1 and HR2 domains and designed the fusion inhibitory peptide HR2P-M2 which proved to be highly effective in blocking its spike protein-mediated membrane fusion and inhibit in vitro MERS-CoV infection16. The results from animal experiments showed that intranasal application of HR2P-M2 peptide could effectively protect mice from MERS-CoV infection with reduction of virus titers in the lung more than 1000-fold29. However, the MERS-CoV HR2P-M2 peptide could not inhibit<br/><br/>SARS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide lacks cross-inhibitory activity against other \u03b2-CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs. To be well prepared for combating the emerging coronaviruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, we designed and synthesized the first pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, and found that EK1 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against all HCoVs that we tested, including SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV, as well as bat SARSr-CoVs. As expected, we recently have shown that EK1 is also effective in inhibiting infection of the novel \u03b2-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitory activity. Indeed, we found that one of the modified EK1 peptides, EK1C4, was 226-fold and 149-fold more potent against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection, respectively, than EK1. EK1C4 also showed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against infection by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other HCoVs.<br/><br/>prophylactic effect against HCoV-OC43 infection in mouse model, suggesting that<br/><br/>EK1C4 may also be used as an inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.<br/><br/>Consistent with other studies virus in the mouse model, and quickly entered and established infection in mouse brain tissue, leading to the relatively weak therapeutic effect of EK1C4 via intranasal administration. However, SARS-CoV-2 mainly infected and caused severe pathological changes in human lung tissue<br/><br/>. We then optimized EK1 peptide in hopes of improving its<br/><br/>EK1C4 showed prolonged and significant<br/><br/>, HCoV-OC43 was showed as a typical neurotropic<br/><br/>. Therefore, EK1C4 administered intranasally is expected to have good therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection.<br/><br/>Currently, no specific anti-CoV therapeutics or prophylactics have been used in clinics for treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A number of nonspecific antiviral drugs, including IFN, lopinavir-ritonavir (HIV protease inhibitors), chloroquine, favipiravir (T-705) and remdesivir (GS-5734), have been used in clinics in China to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection 30. Their in vivo efficacies still require further confirmation. Their potential use for treatment of infection by other coronaviruses and emerging coronaviruses in the future is unclear. Compared with these clinically used nonspecific antiviral drugs, EK1C4 has more advantages for treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, the sequence of its target, the HR1 domain in S2 subunit of S protein, is highly conserved. Therefore, EK1C4 possesses a high genetic barrier to resistance and cannot easily induce drug-resistant mutations. Second, EK1C4 can be used in an intranasal formulation to prevent coronavirus infection. The small bottles can be carried easily by persons who will have close contact with infected patients or high-risk populations. Third, EK1C4 can be used in inhalation formulation for treatment of patients to reduce the viral loads in their lungs, thus attenuating the acute lung injury caused by viral infection and reducing the chance to spread the virions to the closely contacted persons. The inhalation equipment can be used in home or hotel room, reducing the expense of staying in hospitals. Fourth, EK1C4 is expected to be safe to humans because it will be used locally, not systemically, and peptide drugs are generally safer than chemical drugs. Fifth, because of its broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity, EK1C4 can be used for treatment and prevention of infection by not only SARS-CoV-2, but also other HCoVs. Sixth, recently 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been identified 31, but we found that both the HR1 and HR2 domains among those reported genomes show<br/><br/>100% identity (Fig. S9), indicating the high conservation of EK1C4 target. In the meantime, the HR2 derived peptides have much larger interface on HR1 domain, making it more resistant to the viral mutations. Therefore, EK1C4 shows exceptional promise to be developed as the first pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based antiviral therapeutic or prophylactic for treatment or prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and the future reemerging SARS-CoV and emerging SARSr-CoVs."

The resulting sequences encoding the fused HR1-L6-HR2 protein were then cloned into a modified pET-28a vector containing a His6-SUMO tag upstream of the multiple cloning site. The recombinant construct was expressed in<br/><br/>Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) media supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin at 37 \u00b0C and were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 12 h at 16 \u00b0C overnight.

The seven CoVs that can infect humans (HCoVs) include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in the \u03b1-coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage A, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage B (\u03b2-B coronaviruses), and MERS-CoV in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage C 6. To develop specific SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors, it is essential to study the fusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to that of SARS-CoV.

To be well prepared for combating the emerging coronaviruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, we designed and synthesized the first pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, and found that EK1 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against all HCoVs that we tested, including SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV, as well as bat SARSr-CoVs. As expected, we recently have shown that EK1 is also effective in inhibiting infection of the novel \u03b2-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitory activity. Indeed, we found that one of the modified EK1 peptides, EK1C4, was 226-fold and 149-fold more potent against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection, respectively, than EK1. EK1C4 also showed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against infection by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other HCoVs.",
            "EK1C4 may also be used as an inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.",
            "Consistent with other studies virus in the mouse model, and quickly entered and established infection in mouse brain tissue, leading to the relatively weak therapeutic effect of EK1C4 via intranasal administration. However, SARS-CoV-2 mainly infected and caused severe pathological changes in human lung tissue",
            ". Therefore, EK1C4 administered intranasally is expected to have good therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "Currently, no specific anti-CoV therapeutics or prophylactics have been used in clinics for treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A number of nonspecific antiviral drugs, including IFN, lopinavir-ritonavir (HIV protease inhibitors), chloroquine, favipiravir (T-705) and remdesivir (GS-5734), have been used in clinics in China to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection 30. Their in vivo efficacies still require further confirmation. Their potential use for treatment of infection by other coronaviruses and emerging coronaviruses in the future is unclear. Compared with these clinically used nonspecific antiviral drugs, EK1C4 has more advantages for treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, the sequence of its target, the HR1 domain in S2 subunit of S protein, is highly conserved. Therefore, EK1C4 possesses a high genetic barrier to resistance and cannot easily induce drug-resistant mutations. Second, EK1C4 can be used in an intranasal formulation to prevent coronavirus infection. The small bottles can be carried easily by persons who will have close contact with infected patients or high-risk populations. Third, EK1C4 can be used in inhalation formulation for treatment of patients to reduce the viral loads in their lungs, thus attenuating the acute lung injury caused by viral infection and reducing the chance to spread the virions to the closely contacted persons. The inhalation equipment can be used in home or hotel room, reducing the expense of staying in hospitals. Fourth, EK1C4 is expected to be safe to humans because it will be used locally, not systemically, and peptide drugs are generally safer than chemical drugs. Fifth, because of its broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity, EK1C4 can be used for treatment and prevention of infection by not only SARS-CoV-2, but also other HCoVs. Sixth, recently 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been identified 31, but we found that both the HR1 and HR2 domains among those reported genomes show",
            "100% identity (Fig. S9), indicating the high conservation of EK1C4 target. In the meantime, the HR2 derived peptides have much larger interface on HR1 domain, making it more resistant to the viral mutations. Therefore, EK1C4 shows exceptional promise to be developed as the first pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based antiviral therapeutic or prophylactic for treatment or prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and the future reemerging SARS-CoV and emerging SARSr-CoVs."
