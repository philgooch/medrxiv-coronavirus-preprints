Previous studies have pointed out that 42 suboptimal T and B cell responses can delay viral clearance in MERS43 CoV and SARS-CoV infected patients. The role of leukomonocytes in 44 viral clearance of COVID-19 patients is not yet well defined.",

To investigate the factors that contribute to the viral clearance, we comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days.",

Informed consents were obtained from all patients upon admission to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.    Data collection<br/><br/>The medical records, including epidemiological and demographic information, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and outcome of disease, were collected. To avoid subjective biases, two investigators reviewed the data independently and made a final consensus.<br/><br/>Peripheral blood (100 \u03bcl) was collected from patients at admission to hospital and after 7 \u2013 10 days of standard therapy (Version 6, 2020 Feb<br/><br/>18, http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzygj/s7653p/202002/8334a8326dd94d329df351<br/><br/>d7da8aefc2.shtml). Lymphocyte subsets such as CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells were stained by using the BD MultitestTM IMK kit (BD Ltd., San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instruction. The lymphocyte subset analyses were performed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCantoTM II Flow Cytometer).<br/><br/>Serial throat-swab samples were taken from patients at the admission to hospital during 8 \u2013 14 days of standardized treatment (see Table 1)<br/><br/>according to the recommendation in the guideline. The swab samples were placed in 150 \u03bcL of virus preservation solution and viral RNA subsequently extracted as described earlier [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Two target genes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene, were simultaneously amplified and tested in the real-time RT-PCR assay by using a SARS-<br/><br/>CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Shanghai Bio-Germ Medical Technology Co Ltd, Shanghai, China). The reaction mixture consisted of 12 \u03bcL reaction buffer, 4 \u03bcL of enzyme solution, 3 \u03bcL of diethyl pyrocarbonate\u2013treated water, 2 \u03bcL of RNA template, and 4 \u03bcL of probe/primers solution, which contained two sets of probe primers: one set targets towards to ORF1ab (forward prime 5\u2019-<br/><br/>CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA-3\u2019; ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA-3\u2019; CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3\u2019), and another targets<br/><br/>GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT-3\u2019; CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG-3\u2019; TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3\u2019).<br/><br/>The results of the real-time RT-PCR analyzes were interpreted as: a cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive result; a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative result; a towards to reverse and<br/><br/>N the (forward reverse and the primer    5\u2019-    probe    5\u2019-VIC-    primer probe    5\u2019-FAM-<br/><br/>medium load result, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required another test for confirmation. The patients who repeatedly tested SARS-<br/><br/>CoV-2 RNA negative for at least two times with an interval of more than day were regarded as viral negative. These diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease<br/><br/>Control (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/gjhz/jldt/202002/P020200209712430623296.pdf).<br/><br/>Statistical analysis<br/><br/>We used the SPSS 17.0 software package for the statistical analyses.

            "In December 2019, a cluster of novel coronavirus-associated pneumonia cases was emerging in Wuhan, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The disease rapidly spread from Wuhan and caused a wide epidemic in China. The World Health<br/><br/>Organization (WHO) has recently named the disease as Coronavirus<br/><br/>Disease-2019 (COVID-19) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The etiology of the disease is a novel \u03b2coronavirus, taxonomically named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Until February 29, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 causes an epidemic worldwide. More than 80,000 people in over 60 countries or territories have been contracted of COVID-19, and more than 3000 people have died [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].<br/><br/>The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 cases range from an asymptomatic course to serve acute respiratory symptoms and even acute respiratory failure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Transmission occurs from human to human with nosocomial transmissions. The incubation time of COVID-19 has been reported from 0 to 24 days and also asymptomatic carriers can be infectious [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].<br/><br/>As a zoonotic virus, the natural host of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], however, the process of cross-species transmission(s) is still not known. The very first cases were associated with the Huanan Seafood<br/><br/>Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. There is no effective antiviral drug available yet. Although the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unclear, lymphopenia has been found in most COVID-19 patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].<br/><br/>This feature has also been found in the other two fatal human coronavirus infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Previous studies showed that T cells, especially<br/><br/>CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a significant antiviral role in balancing the combat against MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. These results suggested that leukomonocytes counts could be critical indicators associated with severity and the disease outcome. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 25 COVID-19 cases to elucidate the dynamic of lymphocyte subset changes in the peripheral blood and their roles during the viral clearance."

The ages of the patients spanned from 25 to 80 years (average<br/><br/>51.4\u00b116.6 years). Fourteen people described a previous exposure history to the source of infection, either from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale<br/><br/>Market or through direct contacts with COVID-19 patients. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were: fatigue (80.0%), fever (37.4\u201339.1oC, 75.0%), myalgia (68.0%), cough (64.0%), and less common: dyspnea (28.0%) and diarrhea (20.0%). Seven cases had underlying diseases such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, malignancy or chronic liver disease (Table 1).<br/><br/>Laboratory analysis before and after treatment<br/><br/>Laboratory analysis were performed before the treatment. The biochemical aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, and D-dimer, which all were found normal (Table 2). However, blood counts of the patients showed leucopenia (4.5\u00b11.9 \u00d7109/L) and lymphopenia (< 1.3<br/><br/>\u00d7109/L). The counts of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells were found lower than normal values. Interleukin-6 tests included alanine aminotransferase, aspartate had increased to a mean of 16.1 (3.7 \u2013 31.4) pg/ml. Five patients had an increase of procalcitonin (\u22650.05 ng/mL) (Table 2).<br/><br/>The treatment was mainly of supportive care (Table 1). Twenty-four patients were given antiviral therapy including arbidol (orally, 200 mg, three times per day), and oxygen support. Antibiotic therapy, both orally and intravenous, were given as described in Table 1. Fourteen patients received corticosteroids to suppress an excessive inflammatory activation.<br/><br/>After standardized treatment of 8\u201314 days, according to the laboratory analysis of viral RNA, fourteen patients showed viral clearance and 11 patients were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (Table 1).<br/><br/>When comparing the group that showed viral clearance and the group that failed, we found no significant association to sex, epidemiological exposure history, comorbidities, onsets of signs and symptoms, or treatment, but with the age and days of hospitalization. The mean days of hospitalization in the group that showed viral clearance were 12 days (10.0 \u2013 15.0), which was shorter as compared to the group that failed to clear the virus, for which the average days were 21 (18.0 \u2013 23.0) days.<br/><br/>Age can play an important role during the viral clearance: patients without viral clearance were older (60.2\u00b116.9, y) than patients with viral clearance (44.5 \u00b1 13.0 y), showing a statistically significant difference (Table 1).<br/><br/>Association between peripheral lymphocyte counts and disease outcomes<br/><br/>Since lymphopenia was found in all the patients in the current study and also earlier reported elsewhere [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], we further analyzed the association between peripheral lymphocyte counts and disease outcomes. In the 14 patients with viral clearance after the 8 \u2013 14 days of treatment, the counts of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells were restored close to normal levels and with a significant difference as compared to the counts at admission in 12 patients. In the remaining 2 patients with viral clearance the leukomonocytes counts were still at low levels (Figure<br/><br/>1, A-E). However, in the patients without viral clearance (No.=11), no differences were seen before and after treatment regarding the CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, B, and NK cell counts (Figure 1, F-J). The association between peripheral lymphocyte counts and viral detection suggested that higher counts of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells had a significant impact on the viral clearance.<br/><br/>To further monitor the disease outcome of those 11 patients who were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA, we extended the same treatment to 15 \u2013 23 days (Figure 2). At 15 \u201323 days, 7 patients were negative for viral RNA detection (data for leukomonocyte subsets was available for 6 of these 7 patients), but 4 patients were still positive (all these four had been tested for leukomonocyte subsets). The 4 viral RNA positive patients had low counts of CD3+ T cells (< 1200 \u00d7109/L), CD4+<br/><br/>T cells (< 700 \u00d7109/L), CD8+ T cells (< 500 \u00d7109/L), B cells (< 400<br/><br/>\u00d7109/L), and NK cells (< 400 \u00d7109/L). Due to the small sample size, no statistically significant differences for the cell counts were observed, except for the NK cell counts, which showed a significant decrease in the viral RNA positive patients (Figure 2, J). However, we found a similar trend that the increased counts of CD3+ T cells and CD8+ T cells corresponded to cases which were negative for viral RNA detection (5 out of 6). One case that still had low counts of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells was found negative for viral    RNA.    Clinical outcome<br/><br/>We observed the clinical course of 25 COVID-19 patients within 23 days of treatment. During the first phase of treatment, at 8 \u2013 14 days, fourteen patients showed viral clearance and 12 of them were discharged from the hospital according to the guideline. The treatment of oxygen support therapy and clinical observation was continued for the remaining 2 patients in this group. Eleven viral RNA positive patients received a second phase of treatment between 15\u2013 23 days. Until February 28, 7 of these 11 patients turned out to be viral RNA negative. Four of these 7 patients were then discharged from the hospital, while the other 3 (one had a liver disease and the other two still had significant clinical symptoms), together with the 4 patients who were still positive for viral<br/><br/>RNA, were kept under treatment (Table 1). In total, 9 out of the 25<br/><br/>COVID-19 patients were still hospitalized after 23 days of clinical treatment."

            "In this report, we retrospectively investigated the changes of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, B, and NK cell counts in peripheral blood of 25 COVID-<br/><br/>patients during the viral infection and the mechanisms for viral clearance. We found that restoration of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells was associated the viral clearance in COVID-19 patients.<br/><br/>According to the Guideline of the treatment of COVID-19 (Version 6, http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzygj/s7653p/202002/8334a8326dd94d329df351<br/><br/>d7da8aefc2.shtml), the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is based on an epidemiological history of contact with COVID-19 patients or travel to endemic areas, combined with laboratory testing including viral RNA detection and radiological findings. COVID-19 patients have similarities of the clinical features with other coronavirus infections. Most patients had fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue, and less often showed symptoms of dyspnoea, haemoptysis and diarrhea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Half of the cases had comorbidities such as diabetic, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. In our study, we also found some cases that had underlying diseases but without any association with the disease outcome. Age is a risk factor for a more severe disease outcome, because of the generally inferior function of the immune system among older people. Based on the guideline, the patients who have normal body temperature for more than three days, mitigation of respiratory symptoms, improvement of radiological evidences for lesions, and had been tested negative for specific SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR at least twice, can be discharged from the hospital. The average hospitalized time was 17 days (IQR 11.5 \u2013 21.5), and even as long as 23 days for the patients that were released from our study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], suggesting the time for SARS-CoV-2 clearance is also around<br/><br/>Feb days or longer. This was also been observed in an earlier study where the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva continued up to 11 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>].<br/><br/>Until now, there is no effective antivirals available against SARS-CoV-2.<br/><br/>To eliminate the virus an effective immunological response with a minimum of immunopathological effects is required [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. The antigen presentation requires inhibitory alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Successful stimulation can produce viral specific CD4 T cells, which are involved in the development of a specific humoral response, including neutralizing antibodies that can block the viral entry to the cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are required for recognition and killing of the infected cells, further playing a crucial role in SARS-CoV clearance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. However, in the biopsy samples from the patients who died of<br/><br/>COVID-19, histological examination showed pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the lung tissue, suggesting that acute respiratory failure was the cause of death, underlying mechanism that an over-activated immunity injured the lung tissue [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Among SARS patients, high expression of dysregulated chemokines and cytokines were found in blood and lungs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], due to the reason of aberrant immune response caused by the viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The delayed or suboptimal immune responses would make chances for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to escape from the immune responses, and survive and replicate in the host cells, leading a further delay of the viral clearance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. In our study, COVID-19 patients at older ages needed a longer time for the recovery, likely due to the fact that aging is associated with a set of functional and structural alterations in the immune system [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Immune-modulators, as corticosteroids, have been empirically used in both SARS and COVID-19 patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Since corticosteroids might have a decline effect of circulating specific B and T cell subsets [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>], the usage on COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated before considered [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>].<br/><br/>A rapid and generalized lymphopenia has been observed as a prominent part in SARS-CoV and MERS infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Lymphopenia has also been observed in other viral infections such as measles virus and avian influenza virus, swine foot-and-mouth disease virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and HIV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. The possible reasons would be lymphocyte sequestration in the lung tissues, or immune-mediate lymphocyte destruction. In MERS infections, the function of bone marrow or thymus suppressed, and furthermore, T cells underwent apoptosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. In<br/><br/>COVID-19 patients, peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cell counts were found decreased but, they were also hyperactivated, which could result in severe immune injuries [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].<br/><br/>In the present study, we followed the current guidelines and used a specific SARS-CoV-2 realtime RT-PCR for viral detection. Surprisingly, one lymphopenia patient (37y, male, chronic liver disease) was found negative by the realtime RT-PCR and his symptoms had been improved but he is still in hospital. Until now, specific viral RNA detection based on realtime RT-PCR is commonly used in the clinical diagnosis. The usage of realtime RT-PCR is versatile in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract specimen or throat swab, but we must keep in mind that those methods always are followed by the probability of false positive/negative. Besides, around 14% of the discharged COVID-19 patients were tested as positive again on follow up samples (https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-26/14-of-recovered-covid-19-<br/><br/>patients-in-guangdong-tested-positive-again-101520415.html), the recurrence of SARS-CoV-2. This imply that viral detection cannot be used as a single criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis. As a highly contiguous disease with a fatality of approximately 2.3% and up to 49.0%<br/><br/>in critical cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], every hospitalized COVID-19 patient must be evaluated carefully before discharged. The peripheral leukomonocytes counts could provide more information in the evaluation of COVID-19 patients.    showing<br/><br/>In conclusion, we retrospectively analyzed 25 COVID-19 cases and found that restoration of peripheral leukomonocytes could help the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. We propose here that leukomonocytes counts may serve as a valid prognosis of immune reconstitution for recovery of<br/><br/>COVID-19 infection and that can update the current COVID-19 diagnosis guideline."

The etiology of the disease is a novel \u03b2coronavirus, taxonomically named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Until February 29, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 causes an epidemic worldwide. More than 80,000 people in over 60 countries or territories have been contracted of COVID-19, and more than 3000 people have died [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",

Transmission occurs from human to human with nosocomial transmissions.

            "According to the Guideline of the treatment of COVID-19 (Version 6, http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzygj/s7653p/202002/8334a8326dd94d329df351",
            "d7da8aefc2.shtml), the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is based on an epidemiological history of contact with COVID-19 patients or travel to endemic areas, combined with laboratory testing including viral RNA detection and radiological findings. COVID-19 patients have similarities of the clinical features with other coronavirus infections. Most patients had fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue, and less often showed symptoms of dyspnoea, haemoptysis and diarrhea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Half of the cases had comorbidities such as diabetic, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. In our study, we also found some cases that had underlying diseases but without any association with the disease outcome. Age is a risk factor for a more severe disease outcome, because of the generally inferior function of the immune system among older people. Based on the guideline, the patients who have normal body temperature for more than three days, mitigation of respiratory symptoms, improvement of radiological evidences for lesions, and had been tested negative for specific SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR at least twice, can be discharged from the hospital. The average hospitalized time was 17 days (IQR 11.5 \u2013 21.5), and even as long as 23 days for the patients that were released from our study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], suggesting the time for SARS-CoV-2 clearance is also around",
            "18, days or longer. This was also been observed in an earlier study where the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva continued up to 11 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>].",
            "Until now, there is no effective antivirals available against SARS-CoV-2.",
            "To eliminate the virus an effective immunological response with a minimum of immunopathological effects is required [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. The antigen presentation requires inhibitory alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Successful stimulation can produce viral specific CD4 T cells, which are involved in the development of a specific humoral response, including neutralizing antibodies that can block the viral entry to the cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are required for recognition and killing of the infected cells, further playing a crucial role in SARS-CoV clearance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. However, in the biopsy samples from the patients who died of",
            "COVID-19, histological examination showed pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the lung tissue, suggesting that acute respiratory failure was the cause of death, underlying mechanism that an over-activated immunity injured the lung tissue [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Among SARS patients, high expression of dysregulated chemokines and cytokines were found in blood and lungs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], due to the reason of aberrant immune response caused by the viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The delayed or suboptimal immune responses would make chances for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to escape from the immune responses, and survive and replicate in the host cells, leading a further delay of the viral clearance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. In our study, COVID-19 patients at older ages needed a longer time for the recovery, likely due to the fact that aging is associated with a set of functional and structural alterations in the immune system [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Immune-modulators, as corticosteroids, have been empirically used in both SARS and COVID-19 patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Since corticosteroids might have a decline effect of circulating specific B and T cell subsets [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>], the usage on COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated before considered [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>].",

The possible reasons would be lymphocyte sequestration in the lung tissues, or immune-mediate lymphocyte destruction. In MERS infections, the function of bone marrow or thymus suppressed, and furthermore, T cells underwent apoptosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. In",

            "In the present study, we followed the current guidelines and used a specific SARS-CoV-2 realtime RT-PCR for viral detection. Surprisingly, one lymphopenia patient (37y, male, chronic liver disease) was found negative by the realtime RT-PCR and his symptoms had been improved but he is still in hospital. Until now, specific viral RNA detection based on realtime RT-PCR is commonly used in the clinical diagnosis. The usage of realtime RT-PCR is versatile in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract specimen or throat swab, but we must keep in mind that those methods always are followed by the probability of false positive/negative. Besides, around 14% of the discharged COVID-19 patients were tested as positive again on follow up samples (https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-26/14-of-recovered-covid-19-",
