        "abstract": "Background:  The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by 2019-nCoV spread rapidly, and elucidation the diagnostic accuracy of different respiratory specimens is crucial for the control and treatment of this diseases.  \nMethods:  Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. \nFinding:  Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected \u2265 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected \u2265 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples.    \nInterpretation:  Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP. \nFunding  National Science and Technology Major Project, Sanming Project of Medicine and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation.",

The positive rate of throat swab varied in the severe and mild cases. For the severe cases, the positive rates were similar in samples collected 0~7 and 8~14 d.a.o, while low in samples collected \u2265 15 d.a.o. For the mild cases, it showed the highest positive rate in samples collected 0~7 d.a.o, however, very low positive rate in samples collected<br/><br/>8~14 and \u226515 d.a.o. The results indicate that sputum may serve as the most sensitive samples for the virus detection, and followed by nasal swabs.

        "RESULTS": [
            "Altogether, 866 respiratory specimens from 213 patients were collected, including throat swabs, 490 nasal swabs, 142 sputum and 29 BALF. Of these patients, 37 were in severe or critical conditions, and the rest were mild cases (Table 1). The median age of severe cases is 65, and ranged from 34 to 81. Most of the patients belonged to the [45-64] (43.2%) and \u2265 65 (51.4) years of age groups (Table 1). For the mild cases, the median age is 47 with a range of 2 to 86. Unlike the severe cases, most of the mild cases belonged to the [15-44] (42.05%) and [45-64] (42.05%) years of age groups. The male ratio (62.2%) seems like higher than female in severe cases, but there is no statistical difference. Moreover, the sex ratio is similar in both groups of severe and mild cases. The median d.a.o of collection of the first specimen were 7 and for the severe and mild cases, respectively (Table 1). The median number of specimens collected from each patient was 3 (range [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-23]).",
            "The collected different types of specimens from 2019-nCoV confirmed cases were divided into three groups based on the collection time, including the 0~7 d.a.o, 8~14 d.a.o and \u2265 15 d.a.o groups. The qPCR assay was performed for each specimen and the results were shown in table 2. For the 0~7 d.a.o group, the sputum sample showed the highest positive rate in both severe (88.9%) and mild (82.2%) cases, follow by nasal swabs (73.3%, 72.1%) and then the throat swabs (60.0%, 61.3%). In the mild cases, the positive rates from nasal swabs and sputum were similar. BLAF collected during 8~14 d.a.o in the severe cases showed 100% positive, while negative in the",
            "BALF of three mild cases. The sputum collected during 8~14 d.a.o also show the highest positive rate among the upper respiratory samples in both severe and mild cases, much higher than the nasal and throat swabs. Of note, the positive rate of throat swabs is only 50% in severe and 29.6% in mild cases. BALF, sputum and nasal swabs collected from severe cases \u2265 15 d.a.o showed similar positive rate. In mild cases, the positive rates of sputum and nasal swabs were similar, much higher than the throat swabs. In addition, the Ct values were significantly lower in sputum from severe cases.",
            "Serial samples from both upper (including throat swabs, nasal swabs and sputum, marked in red) and lower (BALF, marked in blue) respiratory tract from 13 NCP cases were collected and analyzed. The patients were grouped into severe (N=10, marked in red) and mild (N=3, marked in blue) cases and the detection results were shown in",
            "In severe cases, viral RNAs were detected in all the BALF samples as early as 6 d.a.o, and upper respiratory samples from 10 (10/11) cases. In case 2, although the Ct value was low in BALF, viral RNAs were not detected in all the upper respiratory samples.",
            "Meanwhile, for some severe cases (cases 06 and 07), viral RNAs were not detected in all the upper respiratory samples. As to the 3 mild cases, the viral RNAs was only detected in the upper respiratory samples, not in the BLAF. Moreover, the duration of viral shedding is longer in most of the severe cases.",
            "Computed tomography (CT) scan may serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP",
            "RNA were not detected in the first three or all the upper respiratory samples were analyzed in detail (Table 3 and Fig 2). Case 02 was a female aged 65 with hypertension, and case 07 was a male aged 34 without any underling diseases. Both them had a travelling history to Wuhan. The CT scan of the two cases showed multiple ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs. The PiO2/FiO2 and Murray score were 188 and 2 for case 02, 306 and 1.5 for case 07, which indicated a lung injury.",
            "For the two cases, no viral RNAs were detected in the upper respiratory tract but positive in the BALF. Cases 13 was a male 36 without any underling diseases. Due to the exposure history 8, CT scan and viral screen were done. The CT scan of the this case also showed typical ground-glass opacity in the lung, suggesting a viral pneumonia (Fig 2). However, no viral RNAs were detected until the fourth upper respiratory samples."
        ],
        "DISCUSSION": [
            "According to our results, apart from the BALF collected during 8~14 d.a.o which possessed the 100% (12/12) positive rate, sputum samples showed the highest positive rate in all stages post 2019-nCoV infection, and followed by nasal swabs. The positive rate of throat swab varied in the severe and mild cases. For the severe cases, the positive rates were similar in samples collected 0~7 and 8~14 d.a.o, while low in samples collected \u2265 15 d.a.o. For the mild cases, it showed the highest positive rate in samples collected 0~7 d.a.o, however, very low positive rate in samples collected",
            "8~14 and \u226515 d.a.o. The results indicate that sputum may serve as the most sensitive samples for the virus detection, and followed by nasal swabs. However, a recent study found that only a small portion (28%) of NCP cases showed sputum production 7. As a result, nasal swabs may be the most widely applicable samples for virus detection.",
            "On the contrary, throat swabs were not recommended for the viruses detection, especially the samples collected 8~14 and \u2265 15 d.a.o from mild cases, which may result in a large proportion of false negative results.",
            "Laboratory detection of viral RNA in the respiratory samples of suspected individuals is now considered one of the criteria for the diagnosis of NCP, and the samples from upper respiratory tract were regularly used (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzy gj/s7653p/202002/3b09b894ac9b4204a79db5b8912d4440.shtml). However, as shown in our study (Fig 1), viral RNAs could not be detected in the upper respiratory samples from some severe cases (cases 02, 06 and 07), while positive in the BALF.",
            "Moreover, in some patients like cases 04 and 13, the viruses were not detected in the first three samples, mostly in the 0~7 d.a.o. The results suggest that the suspected patients especially those with exposure history and clinical symptoms might not be excluded from NCP despite that viral RNA was not detected in the upper respiratory samples. Since human to human transmission of 2019-nCoV have been proved in recent studies spread of the virus. Under such circumstances, CT scan might provide important make up for the diagnosis of NCP patients. For example, although no viral RNAs were detected in the first three or all the upper respiratory samples from cases 02, 07 and 13, the CT scans showed typical viral pneumonia linked to NCP [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], and finally",
            "2019-nCoV were identified. Another notification is that, during the antiviral treatment, even though we did not detect the viral RNA in the upper respiratory tract, while it was still positive in the BALF samples of some patients (cases 01, 06 and 07).",
            "Therefore, detection of the viral RNA in the BALF might be necessary for the monitoring of viral shedding, especially the patients in severe conditions.",
            "Studies have shown that 2019-nCoV could utilize Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to infect the host as SARS-CoV did",
            "Interestingly, BALF samples from the severe cases possessed 100% positive rate, while in contrast, no viral RNAs were detected in the three BALF samples from mild cases. Although the sample size was small, it also suggests that the viral distribution is associated with diseases severity. More importantly, why the viruses in some individuals retained in the upper respiratory tract merits further elucidation.",
            "CDC-confirmed NCP patients, which may result in bias of sample selection.",
            "Meanwhile, studies have shown that 2019-nCoV caused asymptomatic infection in some individuals",
            "Secondly, most of samples were collected after antiviral treatment, which may influence the viral shedding. Third, the number of BALF samples was limited, especially for the mild cases. So, it is necessary to include more BALF samples to draw a more precise conclusion on the differences of viral shedding between the severe and mild cases.",
            ", and information of such patients is missing in our study.",
            "In conclusion, sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs, while throat swabs was not recommended for the diagnosis. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for the diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. In addition, CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP. The NCP cases are rapidly increasing, and we hope that this study could provide useful information for the diagnosis and control of the 2019-nCoV infection.",
