            "Structure-based design of a-ketoamides<br/><br/>Our efforts to design novel a-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus Mpros and enterovirus 3Cpros started with a detailed analysis of the following crystal structures of unliganded target enzymes: SARS-CoV Mpro (ref. 25-27; PDB entries 1UJ1, 2BX3, PDB entry 2YNA; see also ref. 27); HCoV-229E Mpro (ref. 27,28; PDB entry: 1P9S); Coxsackievirus B3 3Cpro (our unpublished work; Tan et al, PDB entry 3ZYD); enterovirus D68 3Cpro (ref. 29; PDB entry: 3ZV8); and enterovirus A71 3Cpro (ref. 30; PDB entry: 3SJK).<br/><br/>During the course of the present study, we determined crystal structures of a number of lead a-ketoamide compounds in complex with<br/><br/>SARS-CoV Mpro, HCoV-NL63 Mpro, and CVB3 3Cpro, in support of the design of improvements in the next round of lead optimization.<br/><br/>Notably, unexpected differences between alpha- and betacoronavirus<br/><br/>Mpro were found in this study. The structural foundation of these was elucidated in detail in a subproject involving the Mpro of HCoV NL63; because of its volume, this work will be published separately (Zhang et al, in preparation) and only some selected findings are referred to here. The main protease of the newly discovered coronavirus linked to the Wuhan outbreak of respiratory illness is 96% identical (98%<br/><br/>similar) in amino-acid sequence to that of SARS-CoV Mpro (derived from the RNA genome of BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019, Genbank accession code: MN908947.2; http://virological.org/t/initialgenome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319, last accessed on January<br/><br/>11, 2020), so all results reported here for inhibition of SARS-CoV will most likely also apply to the new virus.<br/><br/>Scheme 1: Synthesis of a-ketoamides.

Zhang, Wuhan, China). The easily detectable reporter activity (firefly or Renilla luciferase) of these replicons has previously been shown to reflect viral RNA synthesis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>] In-vitro RNA transcripts of the enteroviral replicons were also used for transfection. For the SARS-CoV replicon containing the<br/><br/>CMV promoter, only the plasmid DNA was used for transfection.<br/><br/>As the proteases targeted in our study all specifically cleave the peptide bond following a P1-glutamine residue (HCoV-NL63 Mpro uniquely also accepts P1 = His at the Nsp13/Nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] cleavage site31), we decided to use a 5-membered ring (g-lactam) derivative of glutamine (henceforth called GlnLactam) as the P1 residue in all our aketoamides (see Scheme 1). This moiety has been found to be a good mimic of glutamine and enhance the power of the inhibitors by up to<br/><br/>10-fold, most probably because compared to the flexible glutamine side-chain, the more rigid lactam leads to a reduction of the loss of entropy upon binding to the target protease.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] Our synthetic efforts therefore aimed at optimizing the substituents at the P1', P2, and P3 positions of the a-ketoamides.<br/><br/>Initial inhibitor design steps<br/><br/>The initial compound to be designed and synthesized was 11a, which carries a cinnamoyl N-cap in the P3 position, a benzyl group in<br/><br/>P2, the glutamine lactam (GlnLactam) in P1, and benzyl in P1' (Table<br/><br/>1). This compound showed good to mediocre activities against recombinant SARS-CoV Mpro (IC50 = 1.95 \u03bcM; for all compounds, see"

        "discussion": [
            "We describe here the structure-based design, the synthesis, and the assessment of capped dipeptide a-ketoamides that target the main protease of alpha- or betacoronaviruses as well as the 3C protease of enteroviruses. Through crystallographic analyses of a total of six inhibitor complexes of three different proteases in this study, we found the a-ketoamide warhead (-CO-CO-NH-) to be sterically more versatile than other warheads such as Michael acceptors (-CH=CHCO-) and aldehydes (-CH=O), because it features two acceptors for hydrogen bonds from the protein, namely the a-keto oxygen and the amide oxygen, whereas the other warheads have only one such acceptor. In the various complexes, the hydroxy group (or oxyanion) of the thiohemiketal that is formed by the nucleophilic attack of the activesite cysteine residue onto the a-keto carbon, can accept one or two hydrogen bonds from the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole. In addition, the amide oxygen of the inhibitor accepts a hydrogen bond from the catalytic His side-chain. Alternatively, the thiohemiketal can interact with the catalytic His residue and the amide oxygen with the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole. Depending on the exact interaction, the stereochemistry at the thiohemiketal C atom would be different. We have previously observed a similar difference in case of aldehyde inhibitors, where the single interaction point \u2014 the oxyanion of the thiohemiacetal \u2014 can accept a hydrogen bond either from the oxyanion hole or from the catalytic His side-chain,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] resulting in different stereochemistry of the thiohemiacetal carbon. Both aketoamides and aldehydes react reversibly with the catalytic nucleophile of proteases, whereas Michael acceptors form irreversible adducts.<br/><br/>Among a series of aldehydes, Prior et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>] described the capped tripeptidyl a-ketoamide Cbz-1-naphthylalanine-Leu-GlnLactam-COCO-NH-iPr, which showed IC50 values in the 3-digit nanomolar range against HRV 3Cpro and SARS-CoV Mpro, as well as EC50 values of<br/><br/>0.03 \u03bcM against HRV18 and 0.5 \u03bcM against HCoV 229E in cell culture. No optimization of this compound was performed and no toxicity data have been reported.<br/><br/>For compounds with warheads other than a-ketoamides, in-vitro activity against both corona- and enteroviruses has also occasionally been reported. Lee et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>] described three peptidyl Michael acceptors that displayed inhibitory activity against the Mpros of SARS-CoV and<br/><br/>HCoV 229E as well as against the 3Cpro of CVB3. These inhibitors had an IC50 10 - 20 times higher for the CVB3 enzyme, compared to<br/><br/>SARS-CoV Mpro. P2 was invariably isobutyl (leucine) in these compounds, suggesting that further improvement might be possible.<br/><br/>In addition to Michael acceptors, peptide aldehydes have also been used to explore the inhibition of coronavirus Mpros as well as enterovirus 3Cpros. Kim et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] reported a dipeptidyl aldehyde and its bisulfite adduct, both of which exhibited good inhibitory activities against the isolated 3C proteases of human rhinovirus and poliovirus as well as against the 3C-like proteases of a number of coronaviruses, but antiviral activities in cell culture against EV-A71 were poor (EC50 >10<br/><br/>\u03bcM), again most probably due to P2 being isobutyl (leucine).<br/><br/>In addition to better matching the H-bonding donor/acceptor properties of the catalytic center through offering two hydrogen-bond acceptors instead of one, a-ketoamides have another big advantage over aldehydes and a,b-unsaturated esters (Michael acceptors) in that they allow easy extension of the inhibitors to probe the primed specificity subsites beyond S1', although this has so far rarely been explored (e.g., ref. 38 in case of calpain).<br/><br/>In our series of compounds, we used P1 = GlnLactam (g-lactam) throughout, because this substituent has proven to be an excellent surrogate for glutamine.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] While we made some efforts to optimize the P1' residue of the compounds as well as the N-cap (P3), we mainly focussed on optimization of the P2 substituent. In nearly all studies aiming at discovering peptidomimetic inhibitors of coronavirus Mpros, P2 is invariably isobutyl (leucine), and this residue has also been used in the efforts to design compounds that would inhibit enterovirus<br/><br/>Gln[189], whereas the \"floor\" is formed by Met[165] and the \"lid\" by residues 45 - 51, in particular Met[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>]. The two methionines provide<br/><br/>The most prominent a-ketoamide drugs are probably telaprivir and boceprivir, peptidomimetic inhibitors of the HCV NS3/4A protease,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>] which have helped revolutionize the treatment of chronic<br/><br/>HCV infections. For viral cysteine proteases, a-ketoamides have only occasionally been described as inhibitors and few systematic studies have been carried out.<br/><br/>A number of capped dipeptidyl a-ketoamides have been described as inhibitors of the norovirus 3C-like protease.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>] These were optimized with respect to their P1' substituent, whereas P2 was isobutyl in most cases and occasionally benzyl. The former displayed IC50 values one order of magnitude lower than the latter, indicating that the S2 pocket of the norovirus 3CL protease is fairly small. Although we did not include the norovirus 3CLpro in our study, expanding the target range of our inhibitors to norovirus is probably a realistic undertaking.<br/><br/>important interaction points for the P2 substituents of inhibitors; while these interactions are mostly hydrophobic in character, we have previously described the surprising observation of the carboxylate of an aspartic residue in P2 that made polar interactions with the sulfur atoms of these methionines.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] Because the pocket offers so many opportunities for interaction and features a pronounced plasticity, P2 substituents such as isobutyl (from Leu), which are too small to fill the pocket entirely, can still generate sufficient binding enthalpy.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the S2 pocket of SARS-CoV Mpro is the most tolerant among the three enzymes investigated here, in terms of versatility of the P2-substituents accepted.<br/><br/>of 11r against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Whereas the inhibitor exhibits excellent activity against MERS-CoV when Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells are the host cells (400 pM), the inhibitory activity is weaker by a factor of up to 12,500 when Vero cells are used (EC50 = 5 \u03bcM). On the other hand, 11r exhibits excellent anti-MERS-CoV activity in human Calu[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] lung cells, i.e. in the primary target cells where the compound will have to act in a therapeutic setting (A. Kupke, personal communication). As we tested antiviral activity against SARS-CoV exclusively in Vero cells, the EC50 values determined for our compounds against this virus are in the one-digit micromolar range or higher; the best is again compound 11r with EC50 = 2.1 \u03bcM. Interestingly, the relatively weaker activity (or even inactivity) of our inhibitors against RNA viruses in Vero cells was observed independently in the virology laboratories in Leuven and in Leiden. It is thus unlikely that the lack of activity in Vero cells is related to problems with the experimental set-up. In preliminary experiments, we replaced the P3 cinnamoyl group of 11r by the fluorophor coumaryl and found by fluorescence microscopy that much more inhibitor appeared to accumulate in Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells compared to Vero cells (D.L., R.H. & Irina Majoul, unpublished).<br/><br/>In the S2 pocket of the HCoV-NL63 Mpro, Gln[189] is replaced by proline and this change is accompanied by a significant loss of flexibility; whereas the side-chain of Gln[189] of SARS-CoV Mpro is found to accommodate its conformation according to the steric requirements of the P2 substituent, the proline is less flexible, leading to a much smaller space at the entrance to the pocket. As a consequence, a P2benzyl substituent is hindered from penetrating deeply into the pocket, whereas the smaller and more flexible isobutyl group of P2-Leu is not.<br/><br/>Regardless of which cell system is the most suitable one for the testing of peptidomimetic antiviral compounds, we next plan to test<br/><br/>11r in small-animal models for MERS and for Coxsackievirusinduced pancreatitis. In parallel, we aim to refine the experiments to quantify the accumulation of peptidomimetic protease inhibitors in different host-cell types, in the hope to find an explanation for the observed cell-type dependencies.<br/><br/>Finally, in the 3Cpros of EV-A71 and CVB3, the S2 pocket lacks a lid, i.e. it is open to one side. As a consequence, it offers less interaction points for P2 substituents of inhibitors, so that such substituents must reach the \"back-wall\" of the pocket (formed by Arg[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>], Asn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>], Glu71) in order to create sufficient binding energy. Hence, large aromatic substituents such as benzyl are favored by the enterovirus"

            "This work demonstrates the power of structure-based approaches in the design of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds with roughly equipotent activity against coronaviruses and enteroviruses. We observed a good correlation between the inhibitory activity of the designed compounds against the isolated proteases, in viral replicons, and in virus-infected Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells.

Crystallization was performed by equilibrating 1<br/><br/>\u03bcL protein (mixed with 1 \u03bcL precipitant solution) against 500 \u03bcl reservoir containing 6 \u2013 8% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6,000, 0.1 M<br/><br/>MES (pH 6.0), at 20\u00b0C using the vapor diffusion sitting-drop method.<br/><br/>Compounds 11a and 11s were dissolved in 100% DMSO at 50 mM and 200 mM stock concentrations, respectively. A crystal of the free enzyme was soaked in cryo-protectant buffer containing 20% MPD, 6% PEG 6,000, 0.1 M MES, 7.5 mM 11a, pH 6.0, for 2 h at 20\u00b0C.<br/><br/>Another set of free enzyme crystals was soaked in another cryoprotectant buffer with 6% PEG 6,000, 5% MPD, 0.1 M MES, 15%<br/><br/>glycerol, 10 mM 11s, pH 6.0, for 2 h. Subsequently, crystals were fished and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection.<br/><br/>In this structure-based inhibitor optimization study, we achieved major improvements over our original lead compound, 11a, by systematically varying the size and the flexibility of the P2-substituent.<br/><br/>The compound presenting so far the best compromise between the different requirements of the S2 pockets (SARS-CoV Mpro: large and covered, HCoV-NL63 Mpro: small and covered, and CVB3 3Cpro: large and open) is 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl), which has satisfactory broad-spectrum activity against all proteases tested. However, with regard to its antiviral activities in cell cultures, it is inferior to<br/><br/>11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl). The latter compound exhibits very good inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV Mpro as well as the enterovirus 3Cpro, and its performance in the SARS-CoV and enterovirus replicons is convincing. Being in the low micromolar range (EV-A71, CVB3), the data for the antiviral activity in cell culture for 11r correlate well with the inhibitory power of the compound against the recombinant proteases as well as in the replicon-based assays. This is not true, though, for the surprisingly good in-cellulo activity of 11r against HCoV 229E in Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells. Also, the correlation does not seem to hold for LLC-MK2 and CaCo2 cells. We tested the antiviral activity of many of our compounds against HCoV NL63 in these two cell types and found that all of them had low- or submicromolar EC50 values against this virus in LLC-MK2 cells but were largely inactive in CaCo2 cells (not shown). Furthermore, 11r and all other compounds that we synthesized are inactive (EC50 > 87 \u03bcM) against<br/><br/>CVB3 in Vero cells (not shown), but exhibit good to excellent activities against the same virus in Huh-T7 cells. We have previously observed similar poor antiviral activities in Vero cells not only for aketoamides, but also for Michael acceptors (Zhu et al, unpublished work). A similar cell-type dependence is seen for the antiviral activity<br/><br/>Crystals of HCoV-NL63 Mpro with 11a were obtained using cocrystallization. The concentrated HCoV-NL63 Mpro (45 mg\u00b7mL-1) was incubated with 5 mM 11a for 4 h at 20\u00b0C, followed by setting up crystallization using the vapor diffusion sitting-drop method at 20\u00b0C with equilibration of 1 \u03bcL protein (mixed with 1 \u03bcL mother liquor) against 500 \u03bcL reservoir composed of 0.1 M lithium sulfate monohydrate, 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, 25% PEG 1,000, pH<br/><br/>6.0. The crystals were protected by a cryo-buffer containing 0.1 M nm, using a Flx[800] fluorescence spectrophotometer (BioTek).<br/><br/>Curves of relative fluorescence units (RFU) against substrate concentration were linear for all substrates up to beyond 50 \u03bcM, indicating a minimal influence of the inner-filter effect. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared by dissolving them in 100% DMSO. The<br/><br/>UV absorption of 11a was found to be negligible at l = 360 nm, so that no interference with the FRET signal through the inner-filter effect was to be expected. For the determination of the IC50, different proteases at a specified final concentration (0.5 \u03bcM SARS-CoV or<br/><br/>HCoV-NL63 Mpro, 2 \u03bcM CVB3 3Cpro, 3 \u03bcM EV-A71 3Cpro) were separately incubated with the inhibitor at various concentrations (0 to \u03bcM) in reaction buffer at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. Afterwards, the reaction was initiated by adding FRET peptide substrate at 20 \u03bcM final concentration (final volume: 50 \u03bcl). The IC50 value was determined by using the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad). Measurements of enzymatic activity were performed in triplicate and are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviations (SD).<br/><br/>lithium sulfate monohydrate, 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, 25% PEG 1,000, 15% glycerol, 2 mM 11a, pH 6.0 and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.<br/><br/>Crystals of HCoV-NL63 Mpro with 11n or 11f were generated by using the soaking method. Several free-enzyme crystals were soaked in cryo-protectant buffer containing 0.1 M lithium sulfate monohydrate, 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, 25% PEG 1,000, 15%<br/><br/>glycerol, 5 mM 11n (or 11f), pH 6.0. Subsequently, the soaked crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.<br/><br/>Freshly prepared CVB3 3Cpro at a concentration of 21.8 mg\u00b7mL-1 was incubated with 5 mM 11a pre-dissolved in 100% DMSO at room tempature for 1 h. Some white precipitate appeared in the mixture.<br/><br/>Afterwards, the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 20 min at 4<br/><br/>\u00b0C. The supernatant was subjected to crystallization trials using the following, commercially available kits: SigmaTM (Sigma-Aldrich), IndexTM, and PEG RxTM (Hampton Research). Single rod-like crystals were detected both from the IndexTM screen, under the condition of<br/><br/>0.1 M MgCl2 hexahydrate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris, 25% PEG 3,350, pH 5.5, and from the SigmaTM screen at 0.2 M Li2SO4, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 30%<br/><br/>PEG 4,000, pH 8.5. Crystal optimization was performed by using the vapor-diffusion sitting-drop method, with 1 \u03bcL CVB3 3Cpro-inhibitor complex mixed with 1 \u03bcL precipitant solution, and equilibration against 500 \u03bcL reservoir containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.2 M MgCl2, pH<br/><br/>8.5, and PEG 3,350 varied from 22% to 27%. Another optimization screen was also performed against a different reservoir, 0.1 M TrisHCl, 0.2 M MgCl2, pH range from 7.5 to 8.5, and PEG 4,000 varied from 24% to 34%. Crystals were fished from different drops and protected by cryo-protectant solution consisting of the mother liquor and 10% glycerol. Subsequently, the crystals were flash-cooled with liquid nitrogen.<br/><br/>Assessment of inhibitory activity of a-ketoamides using viral replicons and virus-infected cells<br/><br/>Cells and viruses.

A diffraction data set from the SARS-CoV Mpro crystal with compound 11s was collected at 100 K at beamline P11 of<br/><br/>PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg, Germany), using the same type of detector. All diffraction data sets of HCoV-NL63 Mpro complex structures and of the complex of CVB3 3Cpro with 11a were collected at synchrotron beamline BL14.2 of BESSY (Berlin, Germany), using an<br/><br/>MX225 CCD detector (Rayonics). All data sets were processed by the program XDSAPP and scaled by SCALA from the CCP4 suite.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>]<br/><br/>The structure of SARS-CoV Mpro with 11a was determined by molecular replacement with the structure of the complex between SARSCoV Mpro and SG85 (PDB entry 3TNT; Zhu et al, unpublished) as search model, employing the MOLREP program (also from the CCP4 suite).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>] The complex structures of HCoV-NL63 Mpro with 11a, 11f, and 11n were also determined with MOLREP, using as a search model the structure of the free enzyme determined by us (LZ et al, unpublished). The complex structure between CVB3 3Cpro and 11a was determined based on the search model of the free-enzyme structure (PDB entry 3ZYD; Tan et al, unpublished).

Copy RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro using linearized DNA templates, T7 RNA polymerase, and the T7 RiboMaxTM Large-Scale RNA Production System (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.<br/><br/>Inhibitory activity assay of alpha-ketoamides. A buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH<br/><br/>7.3, was used for all the enzymatic assays. Two substrates with the cleavage sites of Mpro and 3Cpro, respectively (indicated by the arrow,<br/><br/>\u2193), Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKM-E(Edans)-NH2 and DabcylKEALFQGPPQF-E(Edans)-NH2 (95% purity; Biosyntan), were employed in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)based cleavage assay, using a 96-well microtiter plate. The dequenching of the Edans fluorescence due to the cleavage of the substrate as catalyzed by the proteases was monitored at 460 nm with excitation at<br/><br/>Transfection. Huh-T7 cells grown in 12-well plates to a confluency of 80% - 90% (2 - 3 x 105 cells/well) were washed with 1 mL<br/><br/>OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and transfected with 0.25 \u03bcg of the replication-competent replicon and Lipofectamin2000 or X-tremeGENE9 in \u03bcl OptiMEM (final volume) as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen or Roche, respectively). The transfection mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 to 5 h (Lipofectamin2000) or overnight (XtremeGENE9), prior to being replaced with growth medium containing the compound under investigation.

Standard curves were prepared using serial dilutions of RNA isolated from virus stock. Data were analysed using<br/><br/>GraphPad Prism 5.0; EC50 values were calculated based on a 4parameter logistic statistics equation. In parallel to the qPCR assays with inhibitors, cell viability assays were performed using AlamarBlueTM Cell Viability Reagent (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. CC50 values were calculated using inhibitor versus normalized response statistics equation by including proper controls (no inhibitor and 1% Triton-X-100- treated cells).<br/><br/>Testing for inhibitory activity of candidate compounds. Initially, we performed a quick assessment of the inhibitory activity of the candidate compounds towards the enteroviral and coronaviral replicons at a concentration of 40 \u03bcM in Huh-T7 cells. Compounds that were relatively powerful and non-toxic at this concentration, were assayed in a dose-dependent manner to estimate their half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) as well as their cytotoxicity (CC50), as described.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] In brief, different concentrations of a-ketoamides (40 \u03bcM in screening experiments or increasing concentration (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 \u03bcM) when determining the EC50) were added to growth medium of replicon-transfected Huh-T7 cells. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were washed with 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS or OPTIMEM, Invitrogen) and lysed in 0.15 mL Passive lysis buffer (Promega) at room temperature (RT) for 10 min. After freezing (-80oC) and thawing (RT), the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (16,000 x g, 1 min) and the supernatant (10 or 20 \u03bcl) was assayed for Firefly or Renilla luciferase activity (Promega or Biotrend<br/><br/>Chemikalien) using an Anthos Lucy-3 luminescence plate reader (Anthos Microsystem).<br/><br/>Determination of the cell toxicity of candidate compounds.

Briefly, 24 h prior to infection, cells were seeded in<br/><br/>96-well plates at a density of 2.5 x 104 (RD cells) or of 1.7 x 104<br/><br/>(HeLa Rh) per well in medium supplemented with 2% FCS. For<br/><br/>HRV2 and HRV14 infection, the medium contained 30 mM MgCl2.<br/><br/>The next day, serial dilutions of the compounds and virus inoculum were added. The read-out was performed 3 days post infection as follows: The medium was removed and 100 \u03bcl of 5% MTS in Phenol<br/><br/>Red-free MEM was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, then the optical density at 498 nm (OD498) of each well was measured by microtiter plate reader (Saffire[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], Tecan). The OD values were converted to percentage of controls and the EC50 was calculated by logarithmic interpolation as the concentration of compound that results in a 50% protective effect against virus-induced CPE. For each condition, cell morphology was also evaluated microscopically.<br/><br/>Chemical synthesis of a-ketoamides<br/><br/>General procedure. Reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without purification. HSGF 254 (0.15 - 0.2 mm thickness) was used for analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC).<br/><br/>All products were characterized by their NMR and MS spectra. 1H<br/><br/>NMR spectra were recorded on 300-MHz, 400-MHz, or 500-MHz instruments. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm, \u03b4) down-field from tetramethylsilane. Proton coupling patterns were described as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), multiplet (m), and broad (br). Mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESI ion-trap HCT Ultra.

            "MERS-CoV poses to global public health may be even more serious than that presented by SARS-CoV. This is related to the high casefatality rate (about 35%, compared to 10% for SARS), and to the fact that MERS cases are still accumulating seven years after the discovery of the virus, whereas the SARS outbreak was essentially contained within 6 months. The potential for human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been impressively demonstrated by the 2015 outbreak in South Korea, where 186 cases could be traced back to a single infected traveller returning from the Middle East.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] SARS-like coronaviruses are still circulating in bats in China,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] from where they may spill over into the human population; this is probably what caused the current outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, which is linked to a seafood and animal market.

A possible solution to the problem could be the development of broadspectrum antiviral drugs that are directed against the major viral protease, a target that is shared by all coronavirus genera as well as, in a related form, by members of the large genus Enterovirus in the picornavirus family.

The fact that there is no known human protease with a specificity for Gln at the cleavage site of the substrate increases the attractivity of this viral target, as there is hope that the inhibitors to be developed will not show toxicity versus the host cell.

            "MERS-CoV poses to global public health may be even more serious than that presented by SARS-CoV. This is related to the high casefatality rate (about 35%, compared to 10% for SARS), and to the fact that MERS cases are still accumulating seven years after the discovery of the virus, whereas the SARS outbreak was essentially contained within 6 months. The potential for human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been impressively demonstrated by the 2015 outbreak in South Korea, where 186 cases could be traced back to a single infected traveller returning from the Middle East.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] SARS-like coronaviruses are still circulating in bats in China,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] from where they may spill over into the human population; this is probably what caused the current outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, which is linked to a seafood and animal market.

            "We describe here the structure-based design, the synthesis, and the assessment of capped dipeptide a-ketoamides that target the main protease of alpha- or betacoronaviruses as well as the 3C protease of enteroviruses. Through crystallographic analyses of a total of six inhibitor complexes of three different proteases in this study, we found the a-ketoamide warhead (-CO-CO-NH-) to be sterically more versatile than other warheads such as Michael acceptors (-CH=CHCO-) and aldehydes (-CH=O), because it features two acceptors for hydrogen bonds from the protein, namely the a-keto oxygen and the amide oxygen, whereas the other warheads have only one such acceptor. In the various complexes, the hydroxy group (or oxyanion) of the thiohemiketal that is formed by the nucleophilic attack of the activesite cysteine residue onto the a-keto carbon, can accept one or two hydrogen bonds from the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole. In addition, the amide oxygen of the inhibitor accepts a hydrogen bond from the catalytic His side-chain. Alternatively, the thiohemiketal can interact with the catalytic His residue and the amide oxygen with the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole. Depending on the exact interaction, the stereochemistry at the thiohemiketal C atom would be different. We have previously observed a similar difference in case of aldehyde inhibitors, where the single interaction point \u2014 the oxyanion of the thiohemiacetal \u2014 can accept a hydrogen bond either from the oxyanion hole or from the catalytic His side-chain,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] resulting in different stereochemistry of the thiohemiacetal carbon.

We observed a good correlation between the inhibitory activity of the designed compounds against the isolated proteases, in viral replicons, and in virus-infected Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells. One of the compounds (11r) exhibits excellent anti-MERS-CoV activity in virus-infected Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells.",
            "Because of the high similarity between the main proteases of SARSCoV and the novel BetaCoV/Wuhan/2019, we expect 11r to exhibit good antiviral activity against the new coronavirus as well.",

However, with regard to its antiviral activities in cell cultures, it is inferior to",
            "11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl). The latter compound exhibits very good inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV Mpro as well as the enterovirus 3Cpro, and its performance in the SARS-CoV and enterovirus replicons is convincing. Being in the low micromolar range (EV-A71, CVB3), the data for the antiviral activity in cell culture for 11r correlate well with the inhibitory power of the compound against the recombinant proteases as well as in the replicon-based assays. This is not true, though, for the surprisingly good in-cellulo activity of 11r against HCoV 229E in Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells. Also, the correlation does not seem to hold for LLC-MK2 and CaCo2 cells. We tested the antiviral activity of many of our compounds against HCoV NL63 in these two cell types and found that all of them had low- or submicromolar EC50 values against this virus in LLC-MK2 cells but were largely inactive in CaCo2 cells (not shown).
