A more optimistic final size of 83300 cases is obtained using the Shanks transformation. Similar figures are obtained using the SIR model, where the predicted size of the epidemic is approximately 84500, and the Shanks transformation lowers this number to about 83700 cases. Naturally, the degree of accuracy of these estimates remains to be seen. In conclusion, qualitatively, both models show that the epidemic is moderating, but recent data show a linear upward trend. The next few days will, therefore, indicate in which direction the epidemic is heading. PS. Today it is more or less clear that the predictions of the article apply only to China. By February 20, 99% of the case was from China. The linear trend in data from Feb 20 onward meant a decreasing number of infected in China and increasing infected elsewhere in the world. In other words, in China, the epidemic is slowing down, 28.02.2020 09:27 however, it is now developing elsewhere in the world. We note that the forecasting methods used in this article are inapplicable in the early stages of an epidemic."

In Tables 3 and 4, the iterated Shanks transformations for the predicted series of the final epidemic size are given. It appears that the predictions of the logistic model tend to the final size of 83231 cases, while the SIR model predictions converge to 83640 cases. Thus, the discrepancy is less than 0.5%."

On 20 Feb we have another change in trend; the data begin to shows almost linear trend (See Fig 3). While the above models show that the epidemic is slow down, the linear trend predicts about 873 new cases per day (see Table 5).",

            "cases and that the peak of the epidemic was on 9 Feb 2020. A more optimistic final size of 83300 cases is obtained using the Shanks transformation. Similar figures are obtained using the SIR model, where the predicted size of the epidemic is approximately 84500, and the Shanks transformation lowers this number to about 83700 cases. Naturally, the degree of accuracy of these estimates remains to be seen. In conclusion, qualitatively, both models show that the epidemic is moderating, but recent data show a linear upward trend. The next few days will, therefore, indicate in which direction the epidemic is heading. PS. Today it is more or less clear that the predictions of the article apply only to China. By February 20, 99% of the case was from China. The linear trend in data from Feb 20 onward meant a decreasing number of infected in China and increasing infected elsewhere in the world. In other words, in China, the epidemic is slowing down, 28.02.2020 09:27 however, it is now developing elsewhere in the world. We note that the forecasting methods used in this article are inapplicable in the early stages of an epidemic."
