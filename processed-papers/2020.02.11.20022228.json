        "abstract": "A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells. We hope this study could be informative for virus-prevention strategy development, especially the treatment of nasal mucus.",

            "Severe infection by 2019-nCoV could result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, causing death in approximately 2% of infected individuals[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Once contacted with the human airway, the spike proteins of 2019-nCoV can bind the surface receptors of sensitive cells, and mediate the virus to enter into target cells. Recently, Xu et.al. modeled the spike protein and indicated that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) could be the receptor for this 2019-nCoV2. Zhou et. al. showed that ACE2 is essential for 2019-nCov to enter HeLa cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. These data indicated that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCov. Once the putative receptor of 2019-nCoV is identified. An urging work is to identify the potential target cells of 2019-nCoV in the human body comprehensively.",
            "Previous studies have investigated the RNA expression of ACE2 in 72 human tissues[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. They found ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestines. They also found ACE2 expression in the basal layer of the non-keratinizing squamous epithelium in nasal and oral mucosa and the nasopharynx. Yu Zhao et al analyzed the single-cell RNA-Seq data of the lung tissues from eight donors and found that ACE2 mainly expressed in the type II alveolar cells (AT2)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. They found that ACE2 shows significantly high expression in AT2 of an Asian donor. However, the abundance of ACE2 expression in the upper respiratory tract needs further identification."
