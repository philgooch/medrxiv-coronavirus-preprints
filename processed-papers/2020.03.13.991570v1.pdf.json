            "12, 2020 and become pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2). In fact, two other coronaviruses have caused global outbreak in the past two decades, namely SARS-CoV (2002-2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2012-",
            "present). The surface spike glycoprotein (S), which is critical for virus entry through engaging the host receptor and mediating virus-host membrane fusion, is the major antigen of coronaviruses. The S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which are phylogenetically closely related, have an amino-acid sequence identity of around 77%",
            "(3). Such a high degree of sequence similarity raises the possibility that cross-reactive epitopes may exist. A recent study has shown that CR3022, which is a human neutralizing antibody that targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV (4), can bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (5). This finding provides an opportunity to uncover a cross-reactive epitope.",
            "CR3022 was previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient and is encoded by germline genes IGHV5-51, IGHD3-10, IGHJ6 (heavy chain), and IGKV4-1, IGKJ2 (light chain) (4). Based on IgBlast analysis (6), the IGHV of CR3022 is 3.1% somatically mutated at the nucleotide sequence level, which results in eight amino-acid changes from the germline sequence, whereas IGKV of CR3022 is 1.3% somatically mutated resulting in three amino-acid changes from the germline sequence (fig. S1). We therefore determined the crystal structure of CR3022 with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 3.1",
            "1E). Five out of 11 somatic mutations are found in the paratope region (fig. S2C), implying their likely importance in the affinity maturation process.",
            "Out of 28 residues in the epitope (defined as residues buried by CR3022), 24 (86%) are conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 1D). This high sequence conservation explains the cross-reactivity of CR3022. Nonetheless, despite having a high conservation in the epitope residues, CR3022 Fab binds to SARS-CoV RBD (Kd = 1",
            "nM) with a much higher affinity than to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Kd = 115 nM) (Table 1 and fig. S3). We postulate that the difference in binding affinity of CR3022 between SARS-",
            "SARS-CoV is an additional N-glycosylation site at N370 (N357 in SARS-CoV numbering). The N-glycan sequon (NxS/T) arises from an amino-acid difference at residue 372, where SARS-CoV has a Thr compared to Ala in SARS-CoV-2 (fig. S4B).",
            "N-glycosylation site in SARS-CoV (8). An N-glycan at N370 would fit into a groove formed between heavy and light chains (fig. S4C), which could increase contact and, hence, binding affinity to CR3022. We then tested whether CR3022 was able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in an in vitro microneutralization assay (7).",
            "While CR3022 could neutralize SARS-CoV, it did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 at the highest concentration tested (400 \u03bcg/mL) (fig. S5). This in vitro neutralization result is consistent with lower affinity binding of CR3022 for SARS-CoV-2, although other explanations are possible as outlined below.",
            "ACE2-binding site (Fig. 2A). Structural alignment of CR3022-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex (11) further indicates that binding of CR3022 would not clash with ACE2 (12). This analysis implies that the neutralization mechanism of CR3022 does not depend on direct blocking of receptor binding, which is consistent with the observation that CR3022 does not compete with ACE2 for binding to the RBD (5). Unlike CR3022, most known SARS RBD-targeted antibodies compete with ACE2 for binding to RBD (4, 13-16). The epitopes of these antibodies are very different from that of CR3022 (Fig. 2B). In fact, it has been shown that CR3022 can synergize with other",
            "RBD-targeted antibodies to neutralize SARS-CoV (4). Although CR3022 itself cannot neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in this in vitro assay, whether CR3022 can synergize with other",
            "Recently, the cryo-EM structure of homotrimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein was determined (17, 18) and demonstrated that the RBD, as in other coronaviruses (19, 20) adopts two different dispositions in the trimer. The RBD can then undergo a hinge-like movement to transition between \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d conformations (Fig. 3A). ACE2 host receptor can only interact with the RBD when it is in the \u201cup\u201d conformation, whereas the \u201cdown\u201d",
            "conformation is inaccessible to ACE2. Interestingly, the epitope of CR3022 is also only accessible when the RBD is in the \u201cup\u201d conformation (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, the ability for CR3022 to access the RBD also depends on the relative disposition of the",
            "RBD on the adjacent protomer. CR3022 can only access RBD when the targeted RBD on one protomer of the trimer and the RBD on the adjacent protomer are both in the \u201cup\u201d",
            "conformation. The variable region of CR3022 would clash with the RBD on the adjacent protomer if the latter adopts a \u201cdown\u201d conformation (Fig. 3D). As a homotrimer, the S protein could potentially adopt four possible RBD configurations, namely none-\u201cup\u201d, single-\u201cup\u201d, double-\u201cup\u201d, and triple-\u201cup\u201d. It appears that CR3022 can only bind to the S protein when it is in double-\u201cup\u201d or triple-\u201cup\u201d configuration. Specifically, one molecule of",
            "CR3022 can be accommodated in the double-\u201cup\u201d configuration (Fig. 3E), whereas three molecules of CR3022 could potentially be accommodated in the triple-\u201cup\u201d configuration (Fig. 3F). Previous cryo-EM studies have also shown that the recombinant SARS-CoV S protein is mostly found in the none-\u201cup\u201d, single-\u201cup\u201d, or double-\u201dup\u201d conformations (19, 21), but rarely in the triple-\u201cup\u201d conformation, even with ACE2 receptor bound (21, 22).",
            "Together with the fact that CR3022 was isolated from a convalescent SARS patient (4), these observations suggest that an antibody response can be elicited against this cryptic epitope in SARS-CoV and possibly SARS-CoV-2. Structural comparison shows that, as compared to SARS-CoV-2, the \u201cup\u201d conformation of RBD in SARS-CoV has a larger dihedral angle to the horizontal plane of the S protein (fig. S6), suggesting that the",
            "CR3022 epitope may be slightly more accessible in SARS-CoV than in SARS-CoV-2, in these spike ectodomain constructs. Nevertheless, the availability of this cryptic epitope on the actual virus surface still has to be quantified to fully comprehend its immunological role during natural infection.",
            "Overall, our study provides insight into how SARS-CoV-2 can be targeted by the humoral immune response and revealed a conserved, but cryptic epitope shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Recently, our group and others have identified a conserved epitope on influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) that is located in the trimeric interface and is only exposed through protein \u201cbreathing\u201d (23-25), which is somewhat analogous to the epitope of CR3022. Antibodies to this influenza HA trimeric interface epitope do not exhibit in vitro neutralization activity but can confer in vivo protection.",
            "Similarly, antibodies to another conserved epitope that partially overlaps with the influenza HA trimeric interface also are non-neutralizing in vitro, but protective in vivo (26). Furthermore, there are other examples of antibodies that do not have in vitro neutralization activity but confer in vivo protection, such as reported for influenza virus (27), herpesvirus (28), cytomegalovirus (29), alphavirus (30), and dengue virus (31).",
            "Therefore, although CR3022 does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro despite its reasonable binding affinity, it is possible that this epitope can confer in vivo protection.",
            "The potential existence of non-neutralizing protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for an effective SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model, which has yet to be established.",
            "Much work is now ongoing in isolating human monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 patients. We anticipate that these investigations will decipher the antigenic properties and major epitopes of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the molecular features that antibodies use for targeting neutralizing epitopes can inspire development of therapeutics, such as antiviral peptides and small molecules (32). As this coronavirus outbreak continues to pose an enormous global risk (33, 34), the availability of conserved epitopes may allow structure-based design not only of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but also for cross-protective antibody responses against future coronavirus epidemics and pandemics. While a more universal coronavirus vaccine is not the most urgent goal at present, it is certainly worthwhile for future consideration especially as cross-protective epitopes are identified so that we can be better prepared for the next novel coronavirus outbreak."

The surface spike glycoprotein (S), which is critical for virus entry through engaging the host receptor and mediating virus-host membrane fusion, is the major antigen of coronaviruses. The S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which are phylogenetically closely related, have an amino-acid sequence identity of around 77%",
            "(3). Such a high degree of sequence similarity raises the possibility that cross-reactive epitopes may exist. A recent study has shown that CR3022, which is a human neutralizing antibody that targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV (4), can bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (5). This finding provides an opportunity to uncover a cross-reactive epitope.",
            "CR3022 was previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient and is encoded by germline genes IGHV5-51, IGHD3-10, IGHJ6 (heavy chain), and IGKV4-1, IGKJ2 (light chain) (4). Based on IgBlast analysis (6), the IGHV of CR3022 is 3.1% somatically mutated at the nucleotide sequence level, which results in eight amino-acid changes from the germline sequence, whereas IGKV of CR3022 is 1.3% somatically mutated resulting in three amino-acid changes from the germline sequence (fig. S1). We therefore determined the crystal structure of CR3022 with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 3.1",
            "\u00c5 resolution (table S1 and fig.S2, A and B) (7). CR3022 uses both heavy and light chains (Fig. 1B), and all six complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops (Fig. 1C)",
            "for interaction with the RBD. The buried surface area on the epitope is 917 \u00c52 and",
            "SARS-CoV-2 recognition by CR3022 is largely driven by hydrophobic interactions (Fig.",
            "1E). Five out of 11 somatic mutations are found in the paratope region (fig. S2C), implying their likely importance in the affinity maturation process.",
            "Out of 28 residues in the epitope (defined as residues buried by CR3022), 24 (86%) are conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 1D). This high sequence conservation explains the cross-reactivity of CR3022. Nonetheless, despite having a high conservation in the epitope residues, CR3022 Fab binds to SARS-CoV RBD (Kd = 1",
            "nM) with a much higher affinity than to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Kd = 115 nM) (Table 1 and fig. S3). We postulate that the difference in binding affinity of CR3022 between SARS-",
            "CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs is due to the non-conserved residues in the epitope (fig.",
            "SARS-CoV is an additional N-glycosylation site at N370 (N357 in SARS-CoV numbering). The N-glycan sequon (NxS/T) arises from an amino-acid difference at residue 372, where SARS-CoV has a Thr compared to Ala in SARS-CoV-2 (fig. S4B).",
            "Mass spectrometry analysis has shown that a complex glycan is indeed present at this",
            "N-glycosylation site in SARS-CoV (8). An N-glycan at N370 would fit into a groove formed between heavy and light chains (fig. S4C), which could increase contact and, hence, binding affinity to CR3022. We then tested whether CR3022 was able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in an in vitro microneutralization assay (7).",
            "While CR3022 could neutralize SARS-CoV, it did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 at the highest concentration tested (400 \u03bcg/mL) (fig. S5). This in vitro neutralization result is consistent with lower affinity binding of CR3022 for SARS-CoV-2, although other explanations are possible as outlined below.",
            "as SARS-CoV (3, 9-11). Interestingly, the epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the",
            "ACE2-binding site (Fig. 2A). Structural alignment of CR3022-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex (11) further indicates that binding of CR3022 would not clash with ACE2 (12). This analysis implies that the neutralization mechanism of CR3022 does not depend on direct blocking of receptor binding, which is consistent with the observation that CR3022 does not compete with ACE2 for binding to the RBD (5). Unlike CR3022, most known SARS RBD-targeted antibodies compete with ACE2 for binding to RBD (4, 13-16). The epitopes of these antibodies are very different from that of CR3022 (Fig. 2B). In fact, it has been shown that CR3022 can synergize with other",
            "RBD-targeted antibodies to neutralize SARS-CoV (4). Although CR3022 itself cannot neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in this in vitro assay, whether CR3022 can synergize with other",
            "SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted monoclonal antibodies for neutralization remains to be determined.",
            "Recently, the cryo-EM structure of homotrimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein was determined (17, 18) and demonstrated that the RBD, as in other coronaviruses (19, 20) adopts two different dispositions in the trimer. The RBD can then undergo a hinge-like movement to transition between \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d conformations (Fig. 3A). ACE2 host receptor can only interact with the RBD when it is in the \u201cup\u201d conformation, whereas the \u201cdown\u201d",
            "conformation is inaccessible to ACE2. Interestingly, the epitope of CR3022 is also only accessible when the RBD is in the \u201cup\u201d conformation (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, the ability for CR3022 to access the RBD also depends on the relative disposition of the",
            "RBD on the adjacent protomer. CR3022 can only access RBD when the targeted RBD on one protomer of the trimer and the RBD on the adjacent protomer are both in the \u201cup\u201d",
            "conformation. The variable region of CR3022 would clash with the RBD on the adjacent protomer if the latter adopts a \u201cdown\u201d conformation (Fig. 3D). As a homotrimer, the S protein could potentially adopt four possible RBD configurations, namely none-\u201cup\u201d, single-\u201cup\u201d, double-\u201cup\u201d, and triple-\u201cup\u201d. It appears that CR3022 can only bind to the S protein when it is in double-\u201cup\u201d or triple-\u201cup\u201d configuration. Specifically, one molecule of",
            "CR3022 can be accommodated in the double-\u201cup\u201d configuration (Fig. 3E), whereas three molecules of CR3022 could potentially be accommodated in the triple-\u201cup\u201d configuration (Fig. 3F). Previous cryo-EM studies have also shown that the recombinant SARS-CoV S protein is mostly found in the none-\u201cup\u201d, single-\u201cup\u201d, or double-\u201dup\u201d conformations (19, 21), but rarely in the triple-\u201cup\u201d conformation, even with ACE2 receptor bound (21, 22).",
            "Together with the fact that CR3022 was isolated from a convalescent SARS patient (4), these observations suggest that an antibody response can be elicited against this cryptic epitope in SARS-CoV and possibly SARS-CoV-2. Structural comparison shows that, as compared to SARS-CoV-2, the \u201cup\u201d conformation of RBD in SARS-CoV has a larger dihedral angle to the horizontal plane of the S protein (fig. S6), suggesting that the",
            "CR3022 epitope may be slightly more accessible in SARS-CoV than in SARS-CoV-2, in these spike ectodomain constructs. Nevertheless, the availability of this cryptic epitope on the actual virus surface still has to be quantified to fully comprehend its immunological role during natural infection.",
            "Overall, our study provides insight into how SARS-CoV-2 can be targeted by the humoral immune response and revealed a conserved, but cryptic epitope shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Recently, our group and others have identified a conserved epitope on influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) that is located in the trimeric interface and is only exposed through protein \u201cbreathing\u201d (23-25), which is somewhat analogous to the epitope of CR3022. Antibodies to this influenza HA trimeric interface epitope do not exhibit in vitro neutralization activity but can confer in vivo protection.",
            "Similarly, antibodies to another conserved epitope that partially overlaps with the influenza HA trimeric interface also are non-neutralizing in vitro, but protective in vivo (26). Furthermore, there are other examples of antibodies that do not have in vitro neutralization activity but confer in vivo protection, such as reported for influenza virus (27), herpesvirus (28), cytomegalovirus (29), alphavirus (30), and dengue virus (31).",
            "Therefore, although CR3022 does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro despite its reasonable binding affinity, it is possible that this epitope can confer in vivo protection.",
            "The potential existence of non-neutralizing protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for an effective SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model, which has yet to be established.",
            "Since there is currently great urgency in the efforts to develop a vaccine against SARS-",
            "CoV-2, characterizing the epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 S protein is extremely valuable.",
            "Much work is now ongoing in isolating human monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 patients. We anticipate that these investigations will decipher the antigenic properties and major epitopes of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the molecular features that antibodies use for targeting neutralizing epitopes can inspire development of therapeutics, such as antiviral peptides and small molecules (32). As this coronavirus outbreak continues to pose an enormous global risk (33, 34), the availability of conserved epitopes may allow structure-based design not only of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but also for cross-protective antibody responses against future coronavirus epidemics and pandemics. While a more universal coronavirus vaccine is not the most urgent goal at present, it is certainly worthwhile for future consideration especially as cross-protective epitopes are identified so that we can be better prepared for the next novel coronavirus outbreak."
