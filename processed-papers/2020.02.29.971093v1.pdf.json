        "abstract": "Many pathogens take advantage of the dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulfate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antivirals.",

            "Heparin, the second most widely used drug by weight globally, is formulated as a polydisperse, heterogenous natural product. Unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins and heparinoids are clinically approved as anticoagulants / thrombotic with excellent safety, stability, bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles. Crucially, heparin and its derivatives, some of which lacking significant anticoagulant activity 1, are an under-exploited antiviral drug class, despite possessing broad-spectrum activity against a multitude of distinct viruses, including coronaviridae and SARSassociated coronavirus strain HSR1 2, in addition to flaviviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], herpes 5, influenza 6 and HIV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].<br/><br/>Traditional drug development processes are slow and ineffective against emerging public health threats such as the current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak which makes the repurposing of existing drugs a timely and attractive alternative. Heparin, a well-tolerated anticoagulant pharmaceutical, has been used safely in medicine for over 80 years and alongside its anticoagulant activities, its ability to prevent viral infection, including coronaviridae, has been described1.

        "Abstract": [
            "Many pathogens take advantage of the dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulfate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antivirals.",

        "Secondary structural prediction was calculated through the BeStSel analysis server 10.To ensure the circular dichroism spectral change of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in the presence of heparin was not altered owing to the addition of the heparin alone, which is known to possess circular dichroism spectra at high concentrations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] a differential spectrum was analysed",
        "The theoretical, summative circular dichroism spectra was confirmed to differ from the observed experimental circular dichroism spectra, thereby indicating that the change in the circular dichroism spectra compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD alone is a result of a conformational change upon binding to porcine mucosal heparin (Leo Pharma, UK)",
        "FGF2, a well characterised heparin-binding protein was used to test the successful functionalization of the three sensing channels with biotin-heparin",
        "The bound FGF2 was removed by a wash with 2 M NaCl, as done previously for the IASys optical biosensor 16",
        "When 65 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was injected over the three sensing channels, there was an initial decrease in signal, followed by an increase, indicative of binding (Fig. 1B between red arrows)",
        "The initial decrease was due to a slightly lower refractive index of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD protein solution compared to the phosphate-buffered saline of the running buffer, which caused a negative bulk shift",
        "This is demonstrated by the injection of 65 nM solution over the control channel, functionalized with just streptavidin, where there was a decrease in response, followed by a return to baseline when the channel was returned to running buffer (Fig. 1C, between red arrows)",
        "These data demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD protein binds to heparin immobilised through its reducing-end and fails to bind to the underlying streptavidin / ethyleneglycol surface",
        "The observed changes further demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD interacts with heparin in aqueous solution of physiological significance, whereby the major changes induced by heparin are those associated with antiparallel and helix content",
        "Basic amino acids are known to dictate the binding between proteins and heparin",
        "Primary sequence analysis of the expressed protein domain and analysis of the modelled SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD structure (Figure 3) shows that there are several potential heparin binding sites and, more importantly, that theses patches of basic amino acids are exposed on the protein surface",
        "The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 represents a significant challenge to global health authorities and, as there are no currently approved drugs to treat, prevent and/or mitigate its effects, repurposing existing drugs is both a timely and appealing strategy",
        "Heparin belongs to a unique class of pharmaceuticals that has effective antidotes available, which makes its use safer",
        "Studying SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein structure and behaviour in solution is a vital step for the development of effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2",
        "The data show that SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binds to heparin and that upon binding, a significant structural change is induced",
        "Glycosaminoglycans are ubiquitously present on almost all mammalian cells and this class of carbohydrates are central to the strategy employed by coronaviridae to attach to host cells",
        "Heparin has previously been shown to inhibit SARS-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 cell invasion [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] and this, in concert with the data presented within this study, supports the utilisation of glycosaminoglycan-derived pharmaceuticals against SARS-associated coronavirus",
        "This study strongly supports the repurposing of heparin and its derivatives as antiviral agents, providing a rapid countermeasure against the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak",
        "It is noteworthy that even pharmaceutical-grade heparin preparations remain a polydisperse mixture of natural products, containing both anticoagulant and nonanticoagulant saccharide structures",
        "The subfractionation of existing heparin preparations against anticoagulant activities for off-label pathologies, provides an attractive strategy for quickly and effectively responding to COVID-19 and for the development of generation heparin-based therapeutics. Such drugs will be amenable to routine parenteral administration through currently established routes and direct to the respiratory tract via nasal administration, using nebulised heparin, which would be unlikely to gain significant access to the circulation",
        "The anticoagulant activity of heparin, which can in any event be engineered out, would not pose a problem",
