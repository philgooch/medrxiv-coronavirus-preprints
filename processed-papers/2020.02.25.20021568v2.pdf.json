            "In December 2019, a new coronavirus infection disease (hereinafter referred to as COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan. Subsequently, the outbreak began to spread widely in China and even abroad.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]<br/><br/>The clinical manifestations of the COVID-19 pneumonia is complicated and could be characterized as fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms onset.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]<br/><br/>Although the nucleic acid detection was considered determinant for identifying the COVID-19 infection and more rapid detection kit for the novel coronavirus has come into mass production, computed tomography (CT) scan is still the most efficient modality for detecting and evaluating the severity of pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] An update series demonstrate that CT findings were positive in all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, even in the early stage.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] In the fifth version of diagnostic manual of COVID-19 launched by the National Health and Health Commission of<br/><br/>China, the radiographic characteristics of pneumonia was included the clinical diagnostic standard in Hubei Province.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] Subsequently, 14,840 new cases of COVID-19 were reported within one day on Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, including 13332 cases of clinical diagnoses.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] This highlighted the importance of CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.<br/><br/>Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19, thousands of patients waited in line for CT examination in the designated fever outpatient hospital at Wuhan and other cities. As of Feb 14, there are 5,534 suspected cases, 38,107 confirmed patients receiving treatment in hospital, and<br/><br/>77,323 cases under medical observation in Hubei province.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] Most of them need to undergo CT examination, however, there are less than 4,500 radiologists in cities of Hubei according to the<br/><br/>China Health Statistical Yearbook (2018).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Meanwhile, because the lung infection foci are small in the early stage of the COVID-19 infection, thinner layer (2.5mm, 1.25mm or even<br/><br/>0.625mm) scanning were usually needed instead of conventional CT scan (5 mm) for diagnosis, which would be more time-consuming. All these made radiologists overloaded, delay the diagnosis and isolation of patients, affect patient\u2019s treatment and prognosis, and ultimately, affect the control of COVID-19 epidemic.<br/><br/>Deep learning, an important breakthrough in the domain of AI in the past decade, has huge potential at extracting tiny features in image analysis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Our group also succeeded in recruiting this technique in minor lesion detection and real-time assistance to doctors in gastrointestinal endoscopy.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]<br/><br/>In the present research, we construct and validate a system based on deep learning for identification of viral pneumonia on CT. Our model has comparable performance with expert radiologist, but take much less time."

            "Patients<br/><br/>We first retrospectively collected 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) for model development. The patients\u2019 CT scan images and reports, history, clinical manifestations, physical findings, and viral pathogen results were all collected. For prospective patients, 27 consecutive patients undergoing CT scans were enrolled in the designated CT rooms in Feb 5, 2020 in Renmin<br/><br/>Hospital of Wuhan University.<br/><br/>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.<br/><br/>Written informed consent was provided by all prospective participants. Because of virus contamination, the signed informed consents were carefully sealed and kept in the specific place according to the Law of the People's Republic of China on Infectious Disease Prevention and<br/><br/>Control.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] For patients whose CT scans were stored in the retrospective databases, informed consent was waived by the Ethics Committee.<br/><br/>Diagnostic testing for COVID-19<br/><br/>Patient's respiratory secretions were collected and transferred to a sterile test tube with a virus transport medium. Fluorescent RT-PCR analysis of samples was performed using the COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kit developed by Shanghai Geneodx Biotechnology Co., Ltd. This detection kit was approved by the US National Drug Administration (NMPA) on January 26, 2019 and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] The rapid, high-precision COVID-19 detection kit greatly accelerated the confirmation of human COVID-19 infection.    Datasets<br/><br/>As shown in Figure 1, a total of 46,096 CT scan images from 51 COVID-19 pneumonia patients and 55 control patients of other disease were collected for developing the model to detect<br/><br/>COVID-19 pneumonia. After filtering those images without good lung fields, 35355 images were selected and split into training and retrospectively testing datasets. Enrolled images in training dataset covered almost all common CT features of COVID19 pneumonia, as presented in Figure 2.<br/><br/>Three radiologists with more than 5 years of clinical experience labelled infection lesions of<br/><br/>COVID-19 pneumonia patients in training dataset, and selected images containing COVID19 pneumonia lesions in testing set, and their labels were combined by consensus. For prospectively testing the model, 13,911 images of 27 consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were further collected. All CT scans were obtained in<br/><br/>Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The instruments used in this study included Optima CT680, Revolution CT and Bright Speed CT scanner (all GE Healthcare).<br/><br/>Training algorithm<br/><br/>UNet++, a novel and powerful architecture for medical image segmentation was implemented to develop the model.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] We first trained UNet++ to extract valid areas in CT images using 289 randomly selected CT images and tested it in other 600 randomly selected CT images. The training images were labelled with the smallest rectangle containing all valid areas by researchers.<br/><br/>The model successfully extracted valid areas in 600 images in testing set with an accuracy of<br/><br/>100%. For detecting suspicious lesions on CT scans, 691 images of COVID-19 pneumonia infection lesions labelled by radiologists and 300 images randomly selected from patients of non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. Taking the raw CT scan images as input with a resolution of 512\u00d7512, and the labelled map from the expert as output, UNet++ was used to train in Keras in an image-to-image manner. The suspicious region was predicted under a confidence cutoff value of 0.50, and a prediction box pixel of over 25.
