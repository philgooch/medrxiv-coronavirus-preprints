        "abstract": "HCoV-19 (SARS-2) has caused >88,000 reported illnesses with a current case-fatality ratio of ~2%. Here, we investigate the stability of viable HCoV-19 on surfaces and in aerosols in comparison with SARS35 CoV-1. Overall, stability is very similar between HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1. We found that viable virus 36 could be detected in aerosols up to 3 hours post aerosolization, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel. HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 exhibited similar half-lives in aerosols, with median estimates around 2.7 hours. Both viruses show relatively long viability on stainless steel and polypropylene compared to copper or cardboard: the median half-life estimate for HCoV-19 is around 13 hours on steel and around 16 hours on polypropylene. Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days.",

            "HCoV-19 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (180 minutes) with a reduction in infectious titer 3 hours post-aerosolization from 103.5 to 102.7 CID50/L (mean across three replicates). This reduction in viable virus titer is relatively similar to the reduction observed in aerosols containing SARS-CoV-1, from 104.3 to 103.5 TCID50/mL (mean across three replicates) (Figure    1A).<br/><br/>HCoV-19 was most stable on plastic and stainless steel and viable virus could be detected up to hours post application (Figure 1B), though by then the virus titer was greatly reduced (polypropylene from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50/mL after 72 hours, stainless steel from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50/mL after 48 hours, mean across three replicates). SARS-CoV-1 had similar stability kinetics and live virus could be detected on these surfaces up to 72 hours on polypropylene and 48 hours on stainless steel (polypropylene from<br/><br/>103.4 to 100.7 TCID50/mL after 72 hours, stainless steel from 103.6 to 100.6 TCID50/mL after 48 hours, mean across three replicates). No viable virus could be measured after 4 hours on copper for HCoV-19 and 8 hours for SARS-CoV-1, or after 24 hours on cardboard for HCoV-19 and 8 hours for SARS-CoV-1    (Figure 1B).<br/><br/>Both viruses exhibited exponential decay in viable virus titer across all experimental conditions, as indicated by linear decrease in the log10TCID50/mL over time (Figure 2A). From the posterior distributions on decay slope parameters we computed posterior distributions for the half-life of each virus in each condition (Figure 2B, Table 1). HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV exhibited similar half-lives in aerosols, with median estimates around 2.7 hours, and 95% credible intervals (2.5%\u201397.5% quantile range) of (1.65, 7.24 hours) for HCoV-19 and (1.81, 5.45 hours) for SARS-CoV-1 (Table 1). Half-lives on copper were also similar between the two viruses. On cardboard, HCoV-19 showed a considerably longer halflife than SARS-CoV-1. Both viruses showed markedly longer viability on stainless steel and polypropylene: the median half-life estimate for HCoV-19 was roughly 13 hours on steel and 16 hours on polypropylene. In general, there was no statistically discernable difference in half-life between the two viruses on any given surface except for cardboard: all other 95% credible intervals for the difference in half-lives overlapped 0 (Fig 2B, Table 1)."

        "discussion": [
            "HCoV-19 has caused many more cases of illness and resulted in more deaths than SARS-CoV-1 and is proving more difficult to contain. Our results indicate that the greater transmissibility observed for<br/><br/>HCoV-19 is unlikely to be due to greater environmental viability of this virus compared to SARS-CoV-1.<br/><br/>Instead, there are a number of potential factors which could account for the epidemiological differences between the two viruses. There have been early indications that individuals infected with HCoV-19 may shed and transmit the virus while pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. This reduces the efficacy of quarantine and contact tracing as control measures relative to SARS-CoV-1.21 Other factors likely to play a role include the infectious dose required to establish an infection, the stability of virus in mucus, and environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] In ongoing experiments, we are studying virus viability in different matrices, such as nasal secretion, sputum and fecal matter, and while varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and relative humidity."

Virus stability in air and on surfaces may directly affect virus transmission, as virus particles need to remain viable long enough after being expelled from the host to be taken up by a novel host.

This reduction in viable virus titer is relatively similar to the reduction observed in aerosols containing SARS-CoV-1, from 104.3 to 103.5 TCID50/mL (mean across three replicates) (Figure",

            "HCoV-19 was most stable on plastic and stainless steel and viable virus could be detected up to hours post application (Figure 1B), though by then the virus titer was greatly reduced (polypropylene from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50/mL after 72 hours, stainless steel from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50/mL after 48 hours, mean across three replicates). SARS-CoV-1 had similar stability kinetics and live virus could be detected on these surfaces up to 72 hours on polypropylene and 48 hours on stainless steel (polypropylene from",
            "103.4 to 100.7 TCID50/mL after 72 hours, stainless steel from 103.6 to 100.6 TCID50/mL after 48 hours, mean across three replicates). No viable virus could be measured after 4 hours on copper for HCoV-19 and 8 hours for SARS-CoV-1, or after 24 hours on cardboard for HCoV-19 and 8 hours for SARS-CoV-1",
            "(Figure 1B).",
            "Both viruses exhibited exponential decay in viable virus titer across all experimental conditions, as indicated by linear decrease in the log10TCID50/mL over time (Figure 2A). From the posterior distributions on decay slope parameters we computed posterior distributions for the half-life of each virus in each condition (Figure 2B, Table 1). HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV exhibited similar half-lives in aerosols, with median estimates around 2.7 hours, and 95% credible intervals (2.5%\u201397.5% quantile range) of (1.65, 7.24 hours) for HCoV-19 and (1.81, 5.45 hours) for SARS-CoV-1 (Table 1). Half-lives on copper were also similar between the two viruses. On cardboard, HCoV-19 showed a considerably longer halflife than SARS-CoV-1. Both viruses showed markedly longer viability on stainless steel and polypropylene: the median half-life estimate for HCoV-19 was roughly 13 hours on steel and 16 hours on polypropylene. In general, there was no statistically discernable difference in half-life between the two viruses on any given surface except for cardboard: all other 95% credible intervals for the difference in half-lives overlapped 0 (Fig 2B, Table 1)."

        "Discussion": [
            "HCoV-19 has caused many more cases of illness and resulted in more deaths than SARS-CoV-1 and is proving more difficult to contain. Our results indicate that the greater transmissibility observed for",
            "HCoV-19 is unlikely to be due to greater environmental viability of this virus compared to SARS-CoV-1.",
            "Instead, there are a number of potential factors which could account for the epidemiological differences between the two viruses. There have been early indications that individuals infected with HCoV-19 may shed and transmit the virus while pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. This reduces the efficacy of quarantine and contact tracing as control measures relative to SARS-CoV-1.21 Other factors likely to play a role include the infectious dose required to establish an infection, the stability of virus in mucus, and environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] In ongoing experiments, we are studying virus viability in different matrices, such as nasal secretion, sputum and fecal matter, and while varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and relative humidity.",
            "The epidemiology of SARS-CoV-1 was dominated by nosocomial transmission and SARS-CoV was detected on variety of surfaces and objects in healthcare settings.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] HCoV-19 transmission is also occurring in hospital settings, with over 3000 reported cases of hospital-acquired infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] These cases highlight the vulnerability of healthcare settings for introduction and spread of HCoV-19.10 However, in contrast to SARS-CoV-1, most secondary transmission has been reported outside healthcare settings 23 and widespread transmission in the community is being seen in several settings, such as households, workplace and group gatherings.",
            "A notable feature of SARS-CoV-1 was super-spreading events, in which a single infected individual was responsible for a large number of secondary cases, well above the average number denoted by the reproduction number Reff.7-11,20A tendency toward such super-spreading events has two important consequences for the epidemiology of emerging infections: it makes any given introduction of infection more likely to die out by chance, but when outbreaks do occur they are explosive and can overwhelm hospital and public health capacity.[24] A number of hypothesized super-spreading events have been reported for HCoV-19. Given that SARS-CoV-1 superspreading events were linked to aerosol and fomite transmission,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] our finding that HCoV-19 has viability in the environment comparable to that of SARS-",
            "CoV-1 lends credence to the hypothesis that it too may be associated with superspreading.",
            "We found that the half-life of HCoV-19 on cardboard is longer than the half-life of SARS-CoV-1.",
            "It should be noted that individual replicate data were noticeably noisier for this surface than the other surfaces tested (Figures S1\u2013S5), so we advise caution in interpreting this result.",
            "Here, we show that the stability of HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 under the experimental circumstances tested is similar. Taken together, our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 are plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days."
