        "abstract": "At the end of 2019, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China, and spread to Guizhou province on January of 2020. To acquire the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 in Guizhou, China, we collected data on 162 laboratory-confirmed cases related to COVID-19. We described the demographic characteristics of the cases and estimated the incubation period, serial interval and basic reproduction number. We also presented two representative case studies in Guizhou province -- Case Study 1 was an example of asymptomatic carrier; and Case Study 2 was an example of a large and complex infection chain that involved four different districts spanning three provinces and eight families. With an estimation of 8 days incubation period and 6 days serial interval, our results indicate that there may exist infectiousness during the incubation period for 2019-nCoV. This increases the difficulty of screening or identifying cases related to COVID-19.",

Figure 2 shows the distribution of the onset date of all cases related to 2019-nCoV over time. It is notable that there was a decline of cases after February 7th, which is most likely attributed to the delay of reporting by the local hospital and laboratory confirmation.",
            "We included 93 confirmed cases with detailed exposure window and onset date information to estimate the incubation period (Fig. 3 A-B). The median incubation period was 8.06 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.89 \u2013 9.36). The",

            "This study provides an initial analysis among epidemiologic characteristics and two typical transmission phenomena of COVID-19. Most index cases were exposed to Wuhan or confirmed cases related to Wuhan, but it is also necessary to prevent the community transmission of COVID-19. Measures such as community screening, isolation of close contacts, public transportation limitation, extended population of PCR testing, enhanced disinfection, and health education etc. could be taken. Our findings provide more epidemiologic data to this incident of COVID-19, which contribute to the further analysis and the control of this disease.",

We estimated the R0 as 1.09 (95% CI: 1.9",
            "\u2013 1.2), which means each patient can infect other 1.09 people on average. In commonly used infection models, when R0 > 1 the infection will be able to start spreading in a population, but not if R0 < 1.",
            "R0 was calculated under the assumptions that an infected individual but has no symptoms does not yet infect others, which assumes that all index cases should show symptoms before their secondary cases. However, as the investigation went on, Guizhou CDC found that there existed index cases who showed symptoms after that of their secondary cases. This may lead to that the estimated R0 was not robust as we do not hold enough evidence and information to the presence of asymptomatic carrier, those data were not included in the estimation model.",
            "There are several limitations in our study. First, we could not collect all complete exposure and onset data from all confirmed cases, due to the recall bias and the lack of standardization on epidemiological investigation at the beginning of the incident. Second, some key data from asymptomatic carrier, especially the onset date or onset window, and left bound of exposure window from cases of Wuhan residents were unavailable, other statistical model may be used to fit such kind of censored data to estimate serial interval and R0 more accurately."
