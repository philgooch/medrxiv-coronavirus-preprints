            "SARS-CoV-2 virus sample<br/><br/>The SARS-CoV-2 material prepared for this work is of the first Australian case of Covid-2019<br/><br/>(Australia/VIC01/2020), maintained in cell culture. In brief, African green monkey kidney cells expressing the human signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM; termed<br/><br/>Vero/hSLAM cells accordingly) and SARS-CoV-2 were grown at 37\u00b0C at 5% CO2 in media consisting of 10 mL Earle\u2019s minimum essential medium, 7% FBS (Bovogen Biologicals, Keilor East, Aus), 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM Sodium pyruvate, 1500 mg/L sodium bicarbonate, 15 mM HEPES and 0.4 mg/ml geneticin in 25cm2 flasks. The genome of the cultured isolate (MT007544.1) has three single nucleotide variants (T19065C, T22303G, G26144T) relative to the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (MN908947.3), and a 10 base deletion in the 3\u2019 UTR. The T22303G and 3\u2019 UTR variants have been confirmed as culture-derived through Sanger sequencing of clinical and culture material.<br/><br/>Nucleic acids were prepared from infected cellular material, following inactivation with linear acrylamide and ethanol. RNA was extracted from a modest cell pellet (~200mg) using manually prepared wide-bore pipette tips and minimal steps to maintain RNA length for long read sequencing, and a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Carrier<br/><br/>RNA was not added to Buffer AVL, with 1% linear acrylamide (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) added instead. Wash buffer AW1 was omitted from the purification stage, with<br/><br/>RNA eluted in 50 \u03bcl of nuclease free water, followed by DNase treatment with Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) 37\u00b0C for 30 min. RNA was cleaned and concentrated to 10 \u03bcl using the RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions.<br/><br/>Nanopore sequencing of direct RNA<br/><br/>Prepared RNA (~1\u03bcg) was carried into a direct RNA sequence library preparation with the<br/><br/>Oxford Nanopore DRS protocol (SQK- RNA002, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) following the manufacturer\u2019s specifications, although without addition of the Control RNA. The library was loaded on an R9.4 flow cell and sequenced on a GridION device (Oxford Nanopore<br/><br/>Technologies), with the sequencing run ending after 40 hours. Signal space data was used to generate nucleobase sequences (\u2018basecalled\u2019) using ont-guppy-for-gridion 3.0.6. Both signal space and basecalled read data are available at BioProject PRJNA608224. It should be noted that non-polyadenylated RNAs are not expected to be detected with this approach.<br/><br/>Characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 subgenome-length mRNA architecture<br/><br/>Direct RNA reads passing the above thresholds were aligned to the genome of the cultured<br/><br/>Australian SARS-COV-2 isolate (MT007544.1), with parallel and concordant analyses in<br/><br/>Geneious Prime (2019.2.1, [M1]) and minimap2 v 2.11 using the \u201cspliced\u201d preset [M2].<br/><br/>Coverage statistics were determined from the resulting read alignments.<br/><br/>To identify intact subgenome-length mRNAs, reads were aligned to a 62 base SARS-COV-2 leader sequence (5\u2019ACCUUCCCAGGUAACAAACCAACCAACUUUCGAUCUCUUGUAGAU<br/><br/>CUGUUCUCUAAACGAAC), with reads aligning to the leader sequence being pooled and visualized in a length histogram. Significant peaks were identified visually and confirmed with a smoothed z-score algorithm. Reads captured in this binning-by-length strategy were re-aligned to the reference genome using the above methods and visualized in Tablet [M3].<br/><br/>Subgenome bins were refined to remove reads which did not originate at the 3\u2019 poly-A tail as expected for intact subgenome-length mRNAs. Subgenome bins were re-aligned, with coverage calculated in SAMtools [M4], and plotted using ggplot2 [M5] in R [M6]. The IPKnot webserver [M7] was used to predict the RNA secondary structures, and the VARNA visualization applet [M8] used to produce schematics.<br/><br/>Identification of 5mC methylation<br/><br/>Nanopore sequencing preserves in vivo base modifications and enables their detection from raw voltage signal information. In brief, the signal space fast5 files corresponding to identified subgenome-length mRNAs were assessed to identify signal changes corresponding to 5mC methylation. These were first retrieved using the fast5_fetcher_multi function in SquiggleKit [M9]. Reads were processed to align raw signal with basecalled sequence data using Tombo v1.5 [https://github.com/nanoporetech/tombo]. Canonical reference sequences were made for each subgenome-length mRNAs, with the binned fast5 files input into the detect_modifications function, with 5mC as the alternate-model parameter. Outputs of which were converted to dampened_fraction wiggle files and exported for visualization and analysis.<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 Phylogenetics<br/><br/>In order to estimate the evolutionary rate and time of origin of SARS-CoV-2, we carried out phylogenetic analyses in BEAST v1.101 [M10], with a curated set of 66 complete and high quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes with date of collection data, as available on February 10th from GISAID and GenBank (Supplementary Table 2). Temporal signal was assessed using<br/><br/>BETS [M11]. Initially we determined whether the evolutionary signal and time over which the genome data were collected was sufficient to calibrate the molecular clock, allowing for the evolutionary rate and timescale of the outbreak to be inferred. The model selection approach from BETS supported a strict molecular clock model with genome sampling times for calibration and a coalescent exponential tree prior, which posits that the number of infected individuals grows exponentially over time. We used the HKY+\u0393 substitution model, and set the following priors for key parameters:<br/><br/>A continuous time Markov chain for the evolutionary rate<br/><br/>A Laplace distribution with mean of 0 and scale of 100 for the growth rate<br/><br/>An exponential distribution with mean of 1 for the effective population size.<br/><br/>A Markov chain Monte Carlo of length 107 was set, sampling every 103 steps, and assessed sufficient sampling by verifying that the effective sample size for all parameters was at least as determined in Tracer [M12], automatically discarding 10% of the burn in. We summarised the posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees by selecting the highest clade credibility tree alongside calculating posterior node probabilities and the distribution of node ages. Comparison to other coronaviral evolutionary rates included studies [M13-20].

            "CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA ((+)ssRNA) virus of the Coronaviridae family, with related Betacoronaviruses capable of infecting mammalian and avian hosts, resulting in illness in humans such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the original severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)[2, 5-6]. Based on limited sampling of potential reservoir species, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be most similar to bat coronaviruses at the genomic level, potentially indicating that bats are its natural reservoir [7-8].",
            "Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, genomic analyses have played a key role in the public health response by informing the design of appropriate molecular diagnostics and corroborating epidemiological efforts to trace contacts [8-10].

It remains highly relevant to validate these assumptions experimentally with SARS-CoV-2-specific data, with the potential to reveal further insights into the biology of this emergent pathogen. To address this, we describe (i) the architecture of the coronaviral subgenome-length mRNAs, and (ii) phylogenetic approaches able to provide robust estimates of coronaviral evolutionary rates and timescales at this early stage of the outbreak.",
            "Characterised coronaviral species produce a nested set of polyadenylated subgenomelength mRNA transcripts through a mechanism termed discontinuous extension of minus strands that yields mRNA transcripts of different length. The discontinuous transcription mechanism repositions the 5\u2032 leader sequence upstream of consecutive viral open-reading frames (ORF) where each translation start site becomes located at the primary position for ribosome scanning (Figure 1a). Subgenome-length mRNAs have a common 5\u2032 leader sequence, near-identical to that located in the 5\u2032-UTR of the viral genome, with the genomelength RNAs also having an mRNA function [13-14]. Discontinuous copy-choice RNA recombination modulates the expression of coronaviral genes [14-15]. Standard sequencing technologies for RNA viruses are unable to produce reads representing (i) RNA viral genomes or (ii) subgenome-length mRNAs, as they generate short read lengths and have a reliance on amplification to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences.",
