We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination countries\u2019 ranking on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak .

            "<strong>Findings We evaluated travellers from</strong><br/><br/>Iranian airports (Tehran, Rasht, and Arak) to international destinations in February 2019. While Qom has reported cases, the international airport is currently being built. Global cities receiving the greatest number of total travellers from Iran include Istanbul, Turkey (46,550), Najaf, Iraq (24,659), and Dubai, UAE (16,340) during this time. Among the top 10 traveller-receiving cities, four (Najaf, Baghdad, Damascus, and Baku) are located in countries with IDVI < 0.6, suggesting elevated vulnerability to infectious disease outbreaks as well as limited ability to detect cases (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1).<br/><br/>UAE, Lebanon, and Canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from Iran in February 2019. We estimated that 18,300 (95% confidence interval: 3770 \u2013 53,470) COVID-19 cases would have had to occur in Iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these three internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing.<br/><br/>Given the low rankings for Lebanon and Canada for outbound air travel, it is unexpected that cases should be identified in these countries, but not Iraq, Syria, or Azerbaijan (countries with higher travel volumes but low IDVI scores). Considering traveller volume alone, the odds of a single case being imported into Iraq rather than Canada or Lebanon would be 33.6:1 and 15.4:1 respectively; for Azerbaijan, the odds would be 3.8:1 and 1.7:1, respectively; while for Syria, the odds would be 3.7:1 and 1.7:1 respectively. As such, we performed exploratory analyses in which we assumed that an unidentified exported case of COVID-19 was present in Iraq, Syria, Azerbaijan, or all 3 countries, in addition to Lebanon, Canada and UAE and estimated the outbreak size in Iran that would produce these results (Figure 2). We also evaluated a scenario where we assumed perfect case detection in travelers from Iran, such that disease is truly absent in countries not reporting cases. Under this \u2018best-case\u2019 scenario, the estimated outbreak size in Iran was smaller but still substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases)."
        ],
        "discussion": [
            "Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. Our analysis would be modified by travel restrictions from Iran due to recent political situations, and by variations in the R0 value. Further, the lack of identified COVID-19 cases in countries with far closer travel ties to Iran suggests that cases in these countries are likely being missed, rather than being truly absent. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics. Supporting capacity for public health initiatives in the region is urgently needed."
