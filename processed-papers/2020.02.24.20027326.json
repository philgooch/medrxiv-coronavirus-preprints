        "abstract": "288 cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection.  We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.",

Fifteen cases were classified as both imported and local transmissions, since they contracted the infection outside China and traveled to a different country once infected (ES01, ES02, GB03, GB04, GB05, GB06, GB07, GB08, KR12, KR16, KR17, KR19, MY09, TH20, TH21 in our database[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]).

Symptoms onset occurred after the travel to the destination country for almost all cases for which date of travel and of onset are available (68 out of 73, 93%).

Overall, the duration from travel to first event (whether symptom onset, or hospitalization for asymptomatic) was also longer, although the difference was not statistically significant (5.0 \u00b1 0.9 days vs. 3.7 \u00b1 0.5 days p= 0.08). Durations of hospitalization were instead comparable among the two groups of cases (1.5 \u00b1 0.7 days vs. 2.6 \u00b1 0.4 days for cases that generated or did not generate secondary transmissions, respectively). Including imported cases with missing information through imputation, we found the same trend though smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant (delay from travel to hospitalization 9.8 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 8.3 \u00b1 0.5 days p= 0.3; delay from travel to onset 5.8 \u00b11.1 vs. 4.2 \u00b10.5 p= 0.16, for cases that generated or did not generate secondary transmissions, respectively). This suggests that importations with missing information may be closer in characteristics to index cases leading to onward transmission. The statistical model predicted a decrease in the average time from travel to detection from 14.5 \u00b1 5.5 days on January 5, 2020 to 6 \u00b1 3.5 days on February 1, 2020 (Figure 2).",

            "As the COVID-19 epidemic in China shows effects of mitigation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], increasingly larger clusters of infections reported outside China are raising concern that other territories may start sustaining the outbreak[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. To contain it globally, identification, rapid management of cases, and contact tracing are key. The success of these response measures depends critically on the volume of importations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and the sensitivity of active surveillance[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].<br/><br/>We reviewed here all confirmed cases out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020 and gathered detailed information on case history and epidemiological links. We identified salient epidemiological features, and modeled the number of importations over time. International exportations from Hubei grew rapidly, fueled by the local epidemic, up to the closure of Wuhan airport preventing further travel of cases. Exportations from other Chinese provinces and other countries grew at a considerably slower pace. This is related to the difference in the increase of cases between Hubei province, origin of the outbreak, and the rest of the affected areas[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Such difference is likely an outcome of the implementation of containment measures in China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>], and of the increased awareness at different phases of the outbreak[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] (i.e. before and after containment measures) leading to self-isolation and quarantine."

Travel restrictions were modelled by assuming a discontinuity in the growth rate. For Hubei, we assumed the growth rate to change from  @'() to  @'45$ after the travel ban of January 23, 2020 (indicated with  @); for the rest of China, we assumed an analogous change from  A'() to  A'45$ after January 29, 2020 ( A), date of first flight cancellations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. No change was considered for the other countries ( = constant over time), as no restrictions of travel were established towards these countries. The scale parameters of the exponential functions ( @'(),  @'45$,  A'(),  A'45$,  =) were assumed to be different among the three sources, to account for different traveling volumes and dates of beginning of importations.",

Including imported cases with missing information through imputation, we found the same trend though smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant (delay from travel to hospitalization 9.8 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 8.3 \u00b1 0.5 days p= 0.3; delay from travel to onset 5.8 \u00b11.1 vs. 4.2 \u00b10.5 p= 0.16, for cases that generated or did not generate secondary transmissions, respectively). This suggests that importations with missing information may be closer in characteristics to index cases leading to onward transmission. The statistical model predicted a decrease in the average time from travel to detection from 14.5 \u00b1 5.5 days on January 5, 2020 to 6 \u00b1 3.5 days on February 1, 2020 (Figure 2).",
            "Nowcasting travel-related cases The model predicted a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, with a growth rate  @'() = 0.26 [95% CI 0.21, 0.31], corresponding to a doubling time of 2.8 days. In comparison, the exponential growth from other territories (rest of China and countries other than China) was slow, A'() =  = = 0.04 [0.00, 0.08]. After the implementation of travel restrictions, a negative growth rate was estimated, signaling a decline in imported cases. The decline was sharp for Hubei ( @'45$ = -0.64 [-0.85, -0.48]) and more gradual for the rest of China ( A'45$ = -0.19 [-0.54, 0.00]). The predicted trend of all imported cases over time is shown in Figure 3, compared with the observed data. Reported importations are predicted to remain stationary in the second and third week of February and to rise again due to the effect of transmission clusters outside China. Imported cases after February 13, 2020 are in agreement with model predictions (Fig.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]).",
            "Trasmission clusters outside China Forty-two transmission clusters were identified out of China in the timeframe under study. Table 1 summarizes the size and country of each cluster. Clusters were grouped according to whether the index case: (i) was a traveling case identified prior to cluster detection; (ii) a traveling case not identified or identified retrospectively once the cluster was observed; (iii) completely unknown. Assuming that clusters of unknown origin were linked to one of the already observed imported cases or, in other words, not linked to an undetected imported case - led to an estimate of 76 [49, 118] undetected imported cases. In this scenario, detected cases would amount to 65% of all imported cases. Assuming instead that all clusters of unknown origin were due to undetected imported cases increased the number of undetected cases to 225 [186, 369], i.e. detected cases would correspond to only 36% of the total.",

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "As the COVID-19 epidemic in China shows effects of mitigation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], increasingly larger clusters of infections reported outside China are raising concern that other territories may start sustaining the outbreak[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. To contain it globally, identification, rapid management of cases, and contact tracing are key. The success of these response measures depends critically on the volume of importations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and the sensitivity of active surveillance[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "We reviewed here all confirmed cases out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020 and gathered detailed information on case history and epidemiological links. We identified salient epidemiological features, and modeled the number of importations over time. International exportations from Hubei grew rapidly, fueled by the local epidemic, up to the closure of Wuhan airport preventing further travel of cases. Exportations from other Chinese provinces and other countries grew at a considerably slower pace. This is related to the difference in the increase of cases between Hubei province, origin of the outbreak, and the rest of the affected areas[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Such difference is likely an outcome of the implementation of containment measures in China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>], and of the increased awareness at different phases of the outbreak[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] (i.e. before and after containment measures) leading to self-isolation and quarantine.",
            "The reduced volume of exported cases worldwide following the travel ban may have given countries the time to prepare and strengthen their surveillance systems, as signaled by a reduction of the interval from travel date to detection over time.",
            "Our model predicts that exportations will likely rise from areas outside China. The number of local transmissions is rapidly increasing in the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Singapore[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>], and few importations in Asia and Europe were registered already from travelers from Japan and Singapore. For this reason, certain countries have updated the history of travel for the case definition of a suspect imported case to include additional countries in South Asia besides China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] or banned travelers from East Asian countries[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. ECDC and WHO currently base their case definition on travel from China only[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], but this may rapidly change in the next days.",
            "Before the likely rebound of exportations, identification and isolation of possible clusters outside China remain essential to contain local transmission. The increasing reporting of clusters outside China with no known epidemiological link[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] raises important concerns on the possibility to contain COVID-19 epidemic worldwide. Our estimates indicate an ability of 36% to detect imported cases in countries outside China. This means that approximately 6 imported cases out of 10 have gone undetected. Previous estimates range from 27%13 to 38%13,15 detection rates, with variations across countries[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Ascertainment was estimated to be even lower (approximately 10%) when assessed on repatriations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. Here, we excluded from this analysis all repatriation events and cruises with outbreaks, as conditions for detection and identification may be different.",
            "Underdetection may be due to several different factors including asymptomatic infections, infections with mild clinical symptoms, health-seeking behavior and declaration of travel history, case definition, and underdiagnosis. Underdetection of imported cases is likely to be higher than what we estimate here, as our analysis is conditional to the identification of clusters of cases. The current situation in Italy, with different clusters emerging in the timeframe of few hours in different areas in the North of the country[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], shows that clusters have gone undetected and epidemiological links with the index case are still missing. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions. Surveillance efforts to track all suspect cases may become impractical if the number of cases increases too rapidly[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. If that situation occurs, countries should be ready to step-up their response and take preparatory steps for community interventions."

            "Due to the time lag between arrival and confirmation, some cases arriving on time t from location S can be undetected as of time T.",
            "The total count of cases arriving on day t is given by \",$ + \",$.",
            "The authors assumed a Poisson distribution for this count, \",$ + \",$~ ( \",$), where \",$ represents the expected number of imported cases from location on day"
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Timeline of travel-related cases The authors collected 288 cases, including 163 imported cases, 109 local transmissions, 30 repatriations, and 1 case of unknown origin.",
            "Among imported cases with full information, the delay from travel to hospitalization was longer in cases that generated secondary transmissions.",
            "Including imported cases with missing information through imputation, the authors found the same trend though smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant.",
            "This suggests that importations with missing information may be closer in characteristics to index cases leading to onward transmission."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "As the COVID-19 epidemic in China shows effects of mitigation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], increasingly larger clusters of infections reported outside China are raising concern that other territories may start sustaining the outbreak[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]",
            "To contain it globally, identification, rapid management of cases, and contact tracing are key.",
            "Exportations from other Chinese provinces and other countries grew at a considerably slower pace",
            "This is related to the difference in the increase of cases between Hubei province, origin of the outbreak, and the rest of the affected areas[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].",
            "Such difference is likely an outcome of the implementation of containment measures in China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>], and of the increased awareness at different phases of the outbreak[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] leading to self-isolation and quarantine"
