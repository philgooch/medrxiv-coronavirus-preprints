            "For the detection assays, we included synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to the RdRp, ORF1b and ORF1ab genes, using the WH-human1 sequence (GenBank MN908947) as a reference. Briefly, the SARS-CoV-2 fragments were synthesized as complementary DNA oligonucleotides and treated with fill-in PCR (NEBNext\u00ae High-<br/><br/>Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix) to generate the DNA templates. These DNA templates were transcribed into RNA using an in vitro transcription (IVT) Kit (Ambion, Invitrogen) under the control of a T7 promoter.<br/><br/>A target amplification step was performed using the TwistAmp\u00ae Basic recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) kit (TwistDx, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and RT was carried out by the addition of 5 \u03bcL of synthetic SARS-CoV-2-RNA input, 2.5 \u03bcL of M-<br/><br/>MuLV reverse transcriptase (NEB), and 1 \u03bcL of murine RNase inhibitor (NEB) in a 50 \u03bcL final reaction volume. Reactions were run for 30 min at 42\u00b0C. The RT-RPA was carried out in one step, with the same pair of primers for both reactions.<br/><br/>To generate the CRISPR-detection complex, we mixed 75 nM of the commercially available<br/><br/>LbCas12a endonuclease (NEB) with the same amount of single guide RNA (sgRNA)<br/><br/>synthesized in-house by hybridization of DNA oligonucleotides followed by fill-in PCR and<br/><br/>IVT. The complexation reaction was carried out in a solution containing 1X NEBuffer 2.1<br/><br/>(NEB) (composed of 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.9)<br/><br/>at room temperature for 10 min.<br/><br/>For plate reader-based assays, ssDNA reporters labeled with FAM were included in the detection mix; while for portable detection with paper strips, ssDNA reporters labeled with biotin were included. The reaction was initiated by diluting the LbCas12a complexes to a final concentration of 37 nM LbCas12a : 37 nM sgRNA in a solution containing 1X<br/><br/>NEBuffer 2.1 (NEB) and 1 \u03bcM custom ssDNA reporter substrates in a 40 \u03bcL reaction volume. A 2 \u03bcL aliquot of RT-RPA input was used. Reactions were incubated for up to 90 min at 37\u00b0C. Fluorescence measurements were acquired at 10 min intervals (\u03bbex: 485 nm and \u03bbem: 535 nm) in a SpectraMax M2 fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices) operated in the 384-well microplate format. For paper-based measurements, we used the Milenia<br/><br/>HybriDetect 1 (TwistDx) lateral flow system, as per the manufacturer's instructions.

        "conclusions": [
            "The current rRT-PCR-based COVID-19 diagnostic approaches have been shown to be very efficient and accurate for virus detection. However, the virus can spread to regions where the equipment required to perform rRT-PCR is not available. We demonstrated that the CRISPR-<br/><br/>Cas12 based detection method is characterized by a LOD value lower than the minimum levels needed to presently detect the virus in clinical samples. The main advantage of the<br/><br/>CRISPR-diagnostic method reported here is its portability and low cost (USD 1-2/reaction)<br/><br/>[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. A possible criticism for this study is that the method has not been tested using patient samples. This is because clinical cases have not yet been reported in our region (South<br/><br/>America). Nevertheless, our work represents a proof-of-principle study of the usefulness of the CRISPR-Cas12 detection technology that could be deployed worldwide without the requirement of sophisticated instrumentation.    Note<br/><br/>While we were preparing this paper, another two protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection using<br/><br/>CRISPR diagnostics (SHERLOCK, v.20200214; DETECTER v.20200215) was published, confirming the potential of the technique."

            "[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. A possible criticism for this study is that the method has not been tested using patient samples. This is because clinical cases have not yet been reported in our region (South",
