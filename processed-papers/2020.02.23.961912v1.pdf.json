        "abstract": "A new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV was recently identified from suckling piglets with severe diarrhea in southern China and its genome sequence is most identical (~95% identity) to that of bat \u03b1-coronavirus HKU2. It again indicates bats are the natural reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 \u00c5 and 2.83 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-coronavirus spikes. The results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 /SADS-CoV and \u03b2-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses.",

            "Coronaviruses, categorized into the order Nidovirales family Coronaviridae and subfamily Coronavirinae, are a large group of viral pathogens with a wide host range[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].<br/><br/>Their infections in humans, other mammals and birds can cause respiratory, hepatic, enteric and neurological diseases with varying severity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have posed severe threats to human health in the 21st century[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. In the meantime, coronaviruses infecting domestic animals also bring substantial economic losses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. For example, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV)<br/><br/>(also known as SeACoV and PEAV) isolated in 2017 caused outbreaks of severe watery diarrhea of suckling piglets with a mortality up to 90% in several commercial pig farms in Guangdong Province of China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. SADS-CoV is an \u03b1-coronavirus and other representative members in the \u03b1-genus are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), human NL63 and 229E coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-<br/><br/>229E)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Representative members in other three genera include mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-<br/><br/>OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the \u03b2-genus, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in the \u03b3-genus and porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) in the \u03b4-genus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].<br/><br/>Cross-species transmission promoted by genetic recombination and/or mutations underlies the host range expansion of coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Bats are the natural reservoir of more than 30 different \u03b1- and \u03b2-coronaviruses that have great potential for interspecies transmission by recombination and/or mutation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Data on genetic evolution, receptor binding and pathogenesis have demonstrated that human SARS-<br/><br/>CoV and MERS-CoV most likely originate from bats[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Palm civets and dromedary camels are the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV from bats to humans[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], respectively. The newly identified porcine SADS-CoV isolates are also found to share<br/><br/>~95% sequence identity with Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2, and this further stressed the severe results of coronavirus spillover from bats to domestic animals[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].<br/><br/>However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of SADS-CoV from bats to pigs are still unknown and need to be further explored. Recently it was shown that SADS-CoV is able to infect cells from a broad range of species including mouse, chicken, pig, monkey and human, indicating a high potential of the SADS-CoV for interspecies transmission[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>].<br/><br/>The spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry by binding host receptor with the S1 subunit and fusing viral and cellular membranes with the S2 subunit, thereby determining viral host range and tissue tropism[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. As a class I viral fusion protein, the spike exists on the envelope of virion as a homotrimer and each monomer contains more than 1000 amino acid residues that can be cleaved into S1 and<br/><br/>S2 subunits[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. For most coronaviruses, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit (NTD) recognizes cell surface carbohydrates, while the C-terminal domain (CTD)<br/><br/>specifically binds to cellular protein receptors[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 utilize<br/><br/>CTD to bind human receptor ACE221-23; MERS-CoV utilizes CTD to bind human receptor DPP424,25; TGEV, PRCV and 229E utilize CTD to bind receptor APN26-28; HCoV-OC43 utilizes NTD to recognize glycans[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]; and one exception is MHV, which utilizes the NTD to bind mouse receptor CEACAM1a30. Therefore, the S1 subunit, especially its NTD and CTD, is the most variable region of the spike, and is responsible for different tropisms of coronaviruses. In comparison, the S2 subunit containing the fusion peptide (FP) and heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) for membrane fusion are more conserved in both sequence and structure[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. For the SADS-CoV, receptor analysis indicated that none of the known coronavirus protein receptors including ACE2, DPP4 and APN are essential for the cell entry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. There are also no reports regarding to the recognition of glycans by the NTD of SADS-CoV.<br/><br/>Structural studies of the spike and its binding with glycans and protein receptors have provided important insights into the origin, evolution and interspecies transmission of coronaviruses. Cryo-EM structures of spike trimer from all four coronavirus genera have been reported: the \u03b1-coronavirus spike structures are determined for HCoV-NL6331, HCoV-229E27 and PEDV32; the \u03b2-coronavirus spike structures are determined for MHV33,34, HCoV-HKU135, HCoV-OC4329, SARS-<br/><br/>CoV21,36-38 and MERS-CoV36,39,40; the \u03b3-coronavirus spike structure is determined for<br/><br/>IBV41 and the \u03b4-coronavirus spike structure is determined for PdCoV42,43. The cryo-<br/><br/>EM structures of bat coronavirus spike trimers have not been reported, and only crystal structures of the CTD from HKU444, HKU545 and HKU946 were determined.<br/><br/>The spikes of SADS-CoV (1130 amino acid residues) and HKU2 (1128 amino acid residues) are the shortest among all known coronavirus spike glycoproteins and their amino acid identities to other known coronavirus spikes are lower than 28%, indicating the spikes of HKU2 and SADS-CoV are unique[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. In this study, we report the cryo-EM structures of the SADS-CoV and HKU2 spike trimers at 2.83 \u00c5 and 2.38<br/><br/>\u00c5 resolution, respectively. The HKU2 spike trimer structure is the first one from bat coronavirus. We analyzed the HKU2 and SADS-CoV trimer structures and also compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit of HKU2 with other spikes from \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-coronaviruses. Our results strongly support that HKU2 and SADS-CoV preserve primitive structural features in their spikes that have a close evolutionary relationship with \u03b2-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses."

            "Table 1.<br/><br/>Overall structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes<br/><br/>The overall structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes we determined here resemble the previously reported pre-fusion structures of coronaviruses spikes. Both spike trimers have a mushroom-like shape (~150 \u00c5 in height and ~115 \u00c5 in width) (Fig. 1a), consisting of a cap mainly formed by \u03b2-sheets of the S1 subunit, a central stalk mainly formed by \u03b1-helices of the S2 subunit, and a root formed by twisted \u03b2-sheets and loops of the S2 subunit (Fig. 1a). In each trimer there is a C3 axis along the central stalk (Fig.<br/><br/>1a). The amino acid identity between HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes is 86%, and these two spike structures are quite similar with the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.)<br/><br/>being 0.53 \u00c5 for 962 aligned C\u03b1 atoms of the monomer and 0.56 \u00c5 for 2886 aligned<br/><br/>C\u03b1 atoms of the trimer. Due to the high structural similarity, we will use the HKU2 structure to present the features of both spikes in the subsequent description, whereas significant differences between them will be pointed out only when necessary.<br/><br/>The S1 subunit of the HKU2 spike comprises two major domains, NTD and CTD, which are followed by two subdomains SD1 and SD2 connecting them to the S2 subunit (Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c). The S1 subunits from three monomers form the cap of the spike, in which the three CTDs in the inner part are at the apex sitting on top of the central stalk and the three NTDs are located outside the CTDs surrounding the central stalk (Fig. 1a). The NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 of the S1 subunit are all mainly composed of \u03b2 strands regarding to the secondary structure feature (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the upstream helix (UH), fusion peptide (FP), connecting region (CR), heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and central helix (CH) of the S2 subunit are mainly composed of helices, whereas the \u03b2hairpin (BH) and subdomain 3 (SD3) at the bottom part of the S2 subunit mainly consist of \u03b2 stands and loops (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the residues after the SD3, which contain the heptad repeat 2 (HR2), are not resolved in the HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike structures, as well as in all other reported coronavirus spike structures in the pre-fusion state.<br/><br/>The SD1 and SD2 of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit are highly similar in amino acid sequence (85%, 84% and 95% identities) and structure (C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. less than 0.5<br/><br/>\u00c5) between HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes (Supplementary Fig. 5). The NTD has the lowest sequence identity of 70% among all domains. Structural superimposition also gave a C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. of 1.2 \u00c5 between these two NTDs, and conformational variations reside in the loops, although the core \u03b2 sheet structure is structurally conserved (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The CTD sequence identity between HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes is 82%, but the C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. between these two CTDs is 1.1 \u00c5, also indicating structural variations in the CTD in comparison with the highly conserved SD1, SD2 and S2 subunit. The NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit are commonly utilized by coronaviruses for binding cell-surface carbohydrates or protein receptors for cell attachment[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Therefore, the sequence and/or structural variations indicate that HKU2 and SADS-CoV would also bind different host receptors by NTD and/or CTD of the<br/><br/>S1 subunit, although their receptors in bat and pig are unknown and the receptorbinding sites on spike have not been defined.<br/><br/>NTD structure and comparisons<br/><br/>The NTD of HKU2 has three layers of antiparallel \u03b2-sheet with the top one consisting of six strands, the middle one consisting of five strands and the bottom one consisting of three strands. Below the bottom sheet is a short \u03b1-helix (Fig. 2a). The top and middle \u03b2-sheets form a galectin-like \u03b2-sandwich fold, which is inserted between two stands of the bottom sheet (Fig. 2a). To supplement, three disulfide bonds are detected in the<br/><br/>HKU2 NTD structure: C17-C56 connecting the N-terminus of the NTD to its upper loop, C124-C149 connecting \u03b26 and \u03b27 stands in the top sheet and C234-C244 connecting the bottom helix to the bottom sheet (Fig. 2a).<br/><br/>Although the NTDs of all coronaviruses adopt a similar overall architecture, the<br/><br/>NTD of HKU2 has the highest structural similarity with the NTD1 (named domain 0 in previous reports) of \u03b1-coronavirus HCoV-NL63 with an r.m.s.d. of 2.7 \u00c5 for 186 aligned C\u03b1 atoms (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 7d). The NTD1 of \u03b1-coronavirus<br/><br/>PEDV is not completely modeled in the spike trimer structure, however the partial model still fits well with the NTD of HKU2 with an r.m.s.d. of 2.3 \u00c5 for 73 aligned C\u03b1 atoms. Both HCoV-NL63 and PEDV have a second NTD (NTD2, also named domain<br/><br/>A in previous reports), and the NTD of HKU2 is structurally less similar to the NTD2 with an r.m.s.d. of 4.3 \u00c5 against HCoV-NL63 NTD2 and of 4.1 \u00c5 against PEDV NTD2<br/><br/>(Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 7d). Recent structural determination showed that another \u03b1-coronavirus, HCoV-229E, also has one NTD, which is more structurally similar to the NTD2 (C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. of 2.0 \u00c5) than the NTD1 (C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. of 3.7 \u00c5) of<br/><br/>HCoV-NL63 (Fig. 2b). All above comparisons indicate that there are two subtypes of<br/><br/>NTD in the \u03b1-coronaviruses: the subtype I represented by the NTDs of HKU2 and<br/><br/>SADS-CoV and the NTD1s of HCoV-NL63 and PEDV, and the subtype II represented by the NTD of HCoV-229E and the NTD2s of HCoV-NL63 and PEDV (Fig. 2b).<br/><br/>Although sharing an overall architecture, these two NTD subtypes have a structural difference in the galectin-like \u03b2-sandwich fold containing the top and middle sheets stacked together through hydrophobic interactions. These two \u03b2 sheets are well aligned in the galectin-like domain of subtype I, whereas there is an alignment shift in the galectin-like domain of subtype II (Fig. 2b). The other notable difference is the distribution of signature disulfide bonds. A signature disulfide bond C124-C149<br/><br/>(numbered in HKU2 and connecting \u03b26 and \u03b27 stands in the top sheet) is conserved in all subtype I NTDs (Fig. 2b), and the subtype II NTDs have two signature disulfide bonds: the first one C145-C168 (numbered in HCoV-229E) connecting \u03b25 and \u03b26 strands and the second one C81-C105 (numbered in HCoV-229E) connecting \u03b22 and neighbor loop (Fig. 2b). Besides, C234-C244 (numbered in HKU2 and connecting the bottom helix to the bottom sheet) is conserved in both subtype I and subtype II NTDs (Fig. 2b).<br/><br/>The NTDs of \u03b2-coronaviruses including BCoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and MHV resemble the subtype I, rather than the subtype II<br/><br/>NTD in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds (Fig. 2c). These \u03b2coronavirus NTDs have additional loops in the N-terminus, between \u03b21 and \u03b22 strands, and between \u03b26 and \u03b27 stands (numbered in HKU2 structure), forming an extensive ceiling-like structure on top of the galectin-like fold (Fig. 2c). It has been found that the evolvement of this ceiling-like structure has functional outcomes such as immune evasion or receptor binding[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. The NTD of \u03b3-coronavirus IBV also resemble the subtype<br/><br/>I NTD in the topology, although its disulfide bond positions are not conserved as in the subtype I NTD (Fig. 2d). To be note, the NTD of \u03b4-coronavirus PdCoV resemble the subtype II NTD in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds (Fig. 2e). Both<br/><br/>IBV and PdCoV NTDs also have additional insertions including loops and short helices in the galectin-like fold compared to the two subtypes of NTD in \u03b1-coronaviruses (Fig.    2d and Fig. 2e).<br/><br/>CTD structure and comparisons<br/><br/>The CTD of HKU2 has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2 sheet as the core with connecting loops between the stands (Fig. 3a). It contains four disulfide bonds: C277-<br/><br/>C300 and C285-C290 at the N-terminus, C341-C397 at the C-terminus and the last one C331-<br/><br/>C369 connecting the \u03b22 and \u03b25 strands in the core \u03b2 sheet (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, the<br/><br/>CTD core of HKU2 is of high structural similarity with the conserved CTD core of \u03b2coronaviruses and the disulfide bonds in the CTD of HKU2 except for C285-C290 are also detected in all \u03b2-coronavirus CTDs (Fig. 3b). These CTDs have the core of one twisted \u03b2-sheet and here we name them as one-layer CTD subtype (Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b).<br/><br/>The \u03b2-coronavirus CTDs always have an insertion consisting of loops and/or stands between the \u03b25 and \u03b26 strands of the core (Fig. 3b). SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HKU4 and HKU5 have receptor-binding motif (RBM) in this insertion region responsible for binding their respective protein receptors[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. In the CTD of HKU2, there is only one short loop between the \u03b25 and \u03b26 strands of the core twisted \u03b2-sheet (Fig. 3a).<br/><br/>Although as members in the \u03b1-genus, HKU2 and SADS-CoV CTD structures are significantly different from those of other \u03b1-coronaviruses HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, PEDV, TGEV and PRCV that contain two layers of \u03b2-sheets (Fig. 3c). And we named these CTDs as two-layer CTD subtype. All available two-layer CTD structures can be well aligned with C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. in the range of 1.0-3.4 \u00c5, except for the CTDs of HKU2 and SADS-CoV. These two-layer CTDs contain two highly conserved disulfide bonds: C540-C586 and C569-C596 (numbered in PEDV CTD) (Fig. 3c). The C569-C596 is conserved among all coronaviruses, whereas the C540-C586 is conserved in all \u03b1-coronaviruses (except for HKU2 and SADS) and \u03b4-coronavirus PdCoV (Fig. 3c).<br/><br/>The CTD of \u03b4-coronavirus PdCoV have a core of two \u03b2-sheets, belonging to the two-layer CTD subtype (Fig. 3c). As for the \u03b3-coronavirus IBV, the core of its CTD is also similar to the typical two-layer CTD (Fig. 3c). However, several \u03b2 strands are replaced by loops and the disulfide bonds are in different positions from the two-layer<br/><br/>CTD (Fig. 3c). IBV CTD also has an extra region of loops, reminiscent of the extra domain in the CTDs of \u03b2-coronaviruses (Fig. 3c).<br/><br/>SD1 and SD2 structures and comparisons<br/><br/>The SD1 and SD2 are two subdomains following the CTD in the S1 subunit, linking the CTD to the S2 subunit. The HKU2 SD1 is a partial \u03b2 barrel consisting of five \u03b2 strands and a disulfide bond (C409-C458) connecting its C-terminus to the \u03b21 strand (Fig.<br/><br/>4a). This five-stranded \u03b2 barrel and the linking disulfide bond are conserved among all four genera of coronavirus (Fig. 4a). The HKU2 SD2 has a structure of two layers of \u03b2-sheet with an additional short \u03b1-helix over the top sheet (Fig. 4b). The additional \u03b1helix and the top sheet is linked by a disulfide bond (C482-C509), and another disulfide bond (C524-C533) links the C-terminal loop to the bottom sheet (Fig. 4b). The two-layer core structure and the second disulfide bond are conserved among all genera of coronavirus, however, the additional \u03b1 helix and the first linking disulfide bond is a distinct feature of \u03b2-coronaviruses plus \u03b1-coronavirus HKU2 and SADS-CoV (Fig. 4b).<br/><br/>This additional helix appears to be an insertion between the primitive \u03b22 and \u03b23 strands of the SD2, and is retained during evolution of \u03b2-coronaviruses.<br/><br/>Quaternary packing of the NTD and CTD in the spike<br/><br/>It has been observed that coronaviruses have two types of quaternary packing mode of the S1 subunits in the trimer: intra-subunit packing and cross-subunit packing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>].<br/><br/>Actually, this is mainly caused by different positioning and interaction between NTD and CTD in the spike monomer. The HKU2 S1 subunit, similar to those in  -<br/><br/>coronaviruses HCoV-NL63, HCoV-226E and PEDV and  -coronavirus PdCoV, have an \u201cinward\u201d CTD which contacts with the NTD (Fig. 5a). The three structural \u201cNTD-<br/><br/>CTD\u201d modules in the cap region of these spikes are composed of NTD and CTD from the same monomer, forming the intra-subunit packing in the spike trimer (Fig. 5a). The<br/><br/>S1 subunits of other coronaviruses in the  - and  -genera including MHV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and IBV have an \u201coutward\u201d CTD that is far away from the<br/><br/>NTD (Fig. 5b). Therefore, the three structural \u201cNTD-CTD\u201d modules in the cap region of these spikes have the NTD from one monomer and the CTD from the adjacent monomer, forming the cross-subunit packing in the spike trimer (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, we found that the \u201coutward\u201d CTDs always have an insertion in the core structure, such as \u03b2-coronavirus CTDs and  -coronavirus IBV CTD (Fig. 5b). In contrast, all \u201cinward\u201d<br/><br/>CTDs only have the one-layer or two-layer core structure without obvious inserted region.<br/><br/>Conserved S2 subunit and a distinct CR<br/><br/>Sequence analysis suggested that the S1/S2 protease cleavage site at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits is R544-M545 in HKU2 spike and R546-M547 in<br/><br/>SADS-CoV spike[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. Compared to the S1 subunit, the topology and structure of S2 subunit are highly conserved in all coronavirus spikes. The HKU2 S2 subunit contains a 3-helix upstream helix (UH) (residues 589-639), a fusion peptide helix (FP) (residues<br/><br/>672-684), a connecting region (CR) (residues 689-747), a 4-helix heptad repeat 1 (HR1)<br/><br/>(residues 748-836), a central helix (CH) (residues 837-887), a twisted \u03b2-hairpin (BH)<br/><br/>(residues 888-929) and a \u03b2-sandwich like SD3 (residues 930-995) (Fig. 1b and Fig. 6a).<br/><br/>Like in other coronavirus spikes in the prefusion state, the model of HR2 after SD3 was not built in the structure due to poor density. Five disulfide bonds in S2 are detected.<br/><br/>Two of them (C590-C612 and C595-C601) stabilize the folded helices of UH, C696-C706 bends the CR, C884-C895 links the CH and the BH, and C934-C943 is within the SD3 (Fig.<br/><br/>6a). The first four disulfide bonds are conserved in all coronaviruses, and the last one in the SD3 has different positions in different spikes. Specifically, it links the \u03b22 and \u03b23 stands of SD3 in the spikes of HKU2, SADS-CoV and MERS-CoV (numbered in<br/><br/>MERS-CoV), and in other coronavirus spikes it links the \u03b22 stand to the C-terminal loop of SD3 (numbered in MERS-CoV) (Supplementary Fig. 6).<br/><br/>All coronavirus spikes have the S2\u2019 protease site upstream from the FP in the S2 subunit, which is essential for proteolytic fusion activation of the spike. Receptor binding and cleavage at the S2\u2019 site promote large-scale conformational changes of the<br/><br/>FP, CR, HR1 and HR2, allowing the insertion of FP into host cell membrane and the formation of six-helix bundle. The FP and CR, which are often not well and totally resolved in other coronavirus spike structures, can be clearly modeled in the HKU2 spike due to the atomic resolution of the map (Supplementary Fig. 4). The typical CR in the S2 subunit contains three helices and one short strand, with a disulfide bond bending the first and second helix to form a turning (Fig. 6b). In HKU2, the second helix is replaced by a short strand (713-716) and the third helix is replaced by a loop (721-741), therefore there are two short strands and only one helix in HKU2 CR (Fig.<br/><br/>6c). The conserved disulfide bond C696-C706 makes the first helix of CR in HKU2 spike turn upside down. The S2\u2019 cleavage site (between R671 and S672) is then covered by the reversed CR helix and loops, and R671 interacts with E723 in the loop and K697 and K698 in helix 1 (Fig. 6c). In other coronaviruses, taking the MHV S2 for example, the helix 1 does not cover the S2\u2019 site (between R869 and S870), and R869 only loosely interacts with T929 in helix 3 (Fig. 6b). After the dissociation of the S1 subunit triggered by receptor binding, the exposure of the S2\u2019 site for cleavage is a prerequisite for the proteolytic activation of the coronavirus spike to mediate membrane fusion. The buried<br/><br/>S2\u2019 site indicates that HKU2 spike, compared to other coronavirus spikes, would require more conformational changes around the S2\u2019 site for the exposure."

        "discussion": [
            "A new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV (also named as SeACoV and PEAV in other reports) was recently identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in southern China, and its genome sequence was most identical (~95% identity) to that of Rhinolophus bat<br/><br/>-coronavirus HKU25-10. The SADS-CoV and HKU2 are phylogenetically located in a sub-lineage closely related to the proposed  -coronavirus group-1b lineage at the complete genome level[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. However, phylogenetic analysis based on the spike glycoprotein indicated that they are members of a separate lineage clustered within  -<br/><br/>coronavirus (Supplementary Fig. 7a), suggesting that HKU2 and SADS-CoV probably resulted from recombination of an  -coronavirus with an unrecognized  -coronavirus<br/><br/>S gene[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. These results, together with the lower than 28% amino acid identities to other known coronavirus glycoproteins, strongly indicate that the spike glycoproteins of HKU2 and SADS-CoV are unique[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. In this study, we determined the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoproteins at atomic resolutions. Pairwise comparisons demonstrated nearly identical overall structures, and differences mainly locate in the loops of NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit between the spikes of HKU2 and<br/><br/>SADS-CoV (Supplementary Fig. 5). A series of structural analysis and comparisons were also performed at the domain level between HKU2 spike with other coronavirus spikes with determined structures. Our results show that HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes maintain primitive structural features, especially in the NTD and CTD, and provide more insights into the evolution of coronaviruses.<br/><br/>The HKU2 and SADS-CoV have one NTD in the S1 subunit, and their structures are more similar to the NTD1 than the NTD2 of  -coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and<br/><br/>PEDV, whereas the only NTD of HCoV-229E is structurally more similar to the NTD2 than the NTD1 (Fig. 2). Therefore, we suggest that \u03b1-coronaviruses have two subtypes of NTD. The evolution relationship between them are not clear yet. It was once suggested that the presence of two NTDs in HCoV-NL63 is a result of gene duplication[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. However, the sequence identity between these two NTDs is only 15.7%<br/><br/>in HCoV-NL63 and 12.9% in PEDV. Considering that HKU2 (SADS-CoV) and<br/><br/>HCoV-229E have one NTD belonging to either subtype I or subtype II, a more plausible evolution way of the NTD in \u03b1-coronaviruses is the recombination of two separate primitive domains into the genome, resulting in the presence of two NTDs in the S1 subunit \u03b1-coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63 and PEDV. To be note, these two NTD subtypes may represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of<br/><br/>NTDs of other genera coronaviruses. For example, in the current available spike structures, the NTDs of  -coronavirus are similar to the HKU2 NTD representing the subtype I in both architecture and disulfide bond positions. These  -coronavirus NTDs also have additional loop ceiling over the top sheet, functionally facilitating immune evasion or binding protein receptor such as in MHV30. The NTD of \u03b3-coronavirus IBV is also architecturally similar to the subtype I, although the disulfide bond positions are not conserved (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the \u03b4-coronavirus PdCoV NTD is similar to the<br/><br/>HCoV-229E NTD representing the subtype II in both architecture and disulfide bond positions (Fig. 2e). A previous study of the IBV spike proposed that \u03b1-coronavirus<br/><br/>NTDs are probably the most ancestral and the NTDs of the four genera form an evolutionary spectrum in the order of \u03b1-, \u03b4-, \u03b3-, and \u03b2-genus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. Our proposal here is similar to the previous one in the point that two NTD subtypes in  -coronaviruses may represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of NTDs.<br/><br/>However, we argue that the evolution pathways may not be in the order of \u03b1-, \u03b4-, \u03b3-, and \u03b2-genus. A more plausible pathway is that the \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03b4-coronavirus NTDs may evolve independently and parallelly from subtype I (\u03b2- and \u03b3-coronavirus NTDs) or subtype II (\u03b4-coronavirus NTDs) (Supplementary Fig. 7b).<br/><br/>The HKU2 and SADS-CoV CTD structure have a one-layer core consisting of a twisted five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2 sheet. Interestingly,  -coronavirus CTDs also have the similar one-layer core structure and three strictly conserved disulfide bonds are also present in the core of HKU2 CTD. Currently, all identified receptor-binding motif of  -<br/><br/>coronavirus CTDs are within an inserted domain between two stands of the core sheet, and this insertion responsible for receptor binding of  -coronaviruses is replaced by a short loop in HKU2 CTD. This result firstly indicates HKU2 CTD represent a primitive structure in the one-layer CTD family, while the inserted domain in  -coronaviruses results from a recombinant event during evolution (Supplementary Fig. 7c). The second indication is that HKU2 and SADS-CoV may not utilize the CTD to bind protein receptors that have not been identified yet, and their different receptor usage may be determined by the NTD that harbors almost 50% of residue difference between them.<br/><br/>To be note, the CTDs from other  -coronaviruses, \u03b3-coronavirus IBV and \u03b4-coronavirus<br/><br/>PdCoV all belong to the two-layer subtype consisting of two layers \u03b2-sheets, although with structural variations in different viruses. These results further confirmed the previous phylogenetic analysis suggesting that HKU2 and SADS-CoV probably resulted from a recombination of an  -coronavirus genomic backbone with an unrecognized  -coronavirus spike gene[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>].<br/><br/>In contrast with the NTD and CTD having unique structural feathers, the SD1 and<br/><br/>SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunits of HKU2 and SADS-CoV are structurally conserved as those of other coronaviruses. In the evolutionary aspect, it is not surprising because this region either connects the CTD to the S2 subunit (SD1 and<br/><br/>SD2) or mediates the membrane fusion, whereas the NTD and CTD are key factors determining tissue tropism and host range of coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Even highly conserved in overall structure, the S2 subunit in HKU2 and SADS-CoV still have a secondary structure arrangement in the connecting region (CR) after the fusion peptide (FP), resulting in a more buried S2\u2019 cleavage site (Fig. 6c). It indicates that although the membrane fusion mechanism is highly conserved, the dynamic fusion procedures of<br/><br/>HKU2 and SADS-CoV may still have their unique features that need to be addressed in the future.<br/><br/>Since the outbreak of SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, new coronaviruses including<br/><br/>MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 in human and PdCoV and SADS-CoV in livestock has been identified[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Extensive studies also revealed a diversity of coronaviruses in bats that could be the source for emergence of zoonotic epidemics such as SARS in the past and new one in the future[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. The spikes of bat coronavirus<br/><br/>HKU2 and porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV (1128 and 1130 residues) are the shortest among all current known coronavirus spike glycoproteins and their NTDs and CTDs may also represent evolutionary ancestors[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. In comparing the structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes with other coronavirus spikes, we observed that additional<br/><br/>NTDs could be recombined, ceiling loops could be inserted into NTD core, and extra domain containing receptor-binding motif could be inserted into the CTD core structure.<br/><br/>These phenomena indicate the subdomains are gradually recruited into the S1 subunit during evolution, and the recruitments are required for cross-species transmission, adapting to different host range, and responding to the updating of host immune system, which provides a vivid example for the co-evolution of virus and host."

It again indicates bats are the natural reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 \u00c5 and 2.83 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-coronavirus spikes. The results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV",
            "S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 /SADS-CoV and \u03b2-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses."

For example, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV)",

Therefore, the S1 subunit, especially its NTD and CTD, is the most variable region of the spike, and is responsible for different tropisms of coronaviruses.
