        "abstract": "17 years after the SARS-CoV epidemic, the world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core -1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site and three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot is highly conserved. In contrast, the upstream attenuator hairpin is less well conserved. Functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate -1 PRF activity. We suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting SARS-CoV mediated -1 PRF may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.",

            "SARS-CoV2, the etiological agent of COVID19, is a member of the coronavirus family (1). Coronaviruses have (+) ssRNA genomes that harbor two long open reading frames (ORF) which occupy the 5\u2019 ~ two-thirds of the genomic RNA (ORF1 and ORF2), followed by several ORFs that are expressed late in the viral replication cycle from subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) (Fig. 1A) (2). In general the immediate early proteins encoded by ORF1 are involved in ablating the host cellular innate immune response, while the early proteins encoded in ORF2 are involved in genome replication and RNA synthesis. These functions include generation the minus-strand replicative intermediate, new plus-strand genomic RNAs, and subgenomic RNAs which mostly encode structural, late proteins. ORF2 is out of frame with respect to ORF1, and all coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) as a means to synthesize the ORF2 encoded proteins (3, 4). -1 PRF is a mechanism in which cis-acting elements in the mRNA direct elongating ribosomes to shift reading frame by 1 base in the 5\u2019 direction [reviewed in (3, 4). The use of a -1 PRF mechanism for expression of a viral gene was first published in 1985 for the Rous sarcoma virus (5). A -1 PRF mechanism was shown to be required to translate ORF1ab in a coronavirus, Avain Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), two years later (6). In coronaviruses -1<br/><br/>PRF functions as a developmental switch, and mutations and small molecules that alter this process have deleterious effects on virus replication (7, 8).<br/><br/>The \u20131 PRF signal can be broken down into three discrete parts: the \u201cslippery site\u201d, a linker region, and a downstream stimulatory region of mRNA secondary structure, typically an mRNA pseudoknot [reviewed in (3)]. The primary sequence of the slippery site and its placement in relation to the incoming translational reading frame is critical: it must be N NNW WWZ (codons are shown in the incoming or 0-frame), where N is a stretch of three identical nucleotides, W is either AAA or UUU, and Z \u2260 G. The linker region is less well-defined, but typically is short (1 \u2013 12 nt long) and is thought to be important for determining the extent of \u20131 PRF in a virus-specific manner. The function of the downstream secondary structure is to induce elongating ribosomes to pause, a critical step for efficient \u20131 PRF to occur [reviewed in (9)]. The generally accepted mechanism of \u20131 PRF is that the mRNA secondary structure directs elongating ribosomes to pause with its A- and Psite bound aminoacyl- (aa-) and peptidyl-tRNAs are positioned over the slippery site. The sequence of the slippery site allows for repairing of the tRNAs to the \u20131 frame codons after they \u201csimultaneously slip\u201d by one base in the 5\u2019 direction along the mRNA. The subsequent resolution of the downstream mRNA secondary structure allows the ribosome to continue elongation of the nascent polypeptide in the new translational reading frame. The downstream stimulatory elements are most commonly H-type mRNA pseudoknots, so called because they are composed of two coaxially stacked stem-loops where the second stem is formed by base pairing between sequence in the loop of the first-stem loop, and additional downstream sequence (10). The SARS-CoV pseudoknot is more complex because it contains a third, internal stem-loop element (11\u201313). Mutations affecting this structure decreased rates of -1 PRF, and had deleterious effects on virus propagation, thus suggesting that it may present a target for small molecule therapeutics (7, 8). In addition, the presence of a hairpin located immediately 5\u2019 of the slippery site has been reported to regulate -1 PRF by attenuating its activity (14). Here, we report on the -1 PRF signal from SARS-CoV2. The core -1 PRF signal is nearly identical to the SARS-CoV -1 PRF signal, containing only a single nucleotide difference, a C to A. This change maps to a loop region in the molecule that is not predicted to impact on the structure of the three-stemmed pseudoknot. The attenuator hairpin appears to be less-well conserved. However, functional analyses reveal that both elements promote nearly identical rates of -1 PRF, suggesting that this element has been structurally and functionally conserved."

            "<strong>Results and Discussion</strong><br/><br/>Comparative structural analyses of the two -1 PRF signals. The core of the SARS-CoV -1 PRF signal begins with the U UUA AAC slippery site. This is followed by a 6 nt spacer region, which is then followed by the threestemmed -1 PRF stimulating mRNA pseudoknot. A second regulatory element, called the attenuator hairpin, is located 5\u2019 of the slippery site. Pairwise analysis of the SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals revealed that the sequence of the attenuator hairpin was less well conserved than the frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot (Fig. 1B). The structure of the SARS-CoV -1 PRF signal was previously determined to include a threestemmed mRNA pseudoknot (11). Using this as a guide, the single C to A base difference between the core SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF signals maps to a loop that is not predicted to alter the structure of the -1 PRF stimulating element (7) (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the attenuator hairpin contains six differences in the nucleotide sequence between the two viruses, and the SARS-CoV-2 element is predicted to be less stable than its SARS-CoV counterpart (Fig. 1D). This suggests that the attenuation activity of this element is not as important as the ability to direct -1 PRF per se.<br/><br/>Comparative functional analyses of the two -1 PRF signals. Standard dual-luciferase assays were used to monitor -1 PRF activities of the two -1 PRF signals (15, 16) in HEK and HeLa cells. For both of the elements, -1 PRF activity was ~20% in HEK (Fig. 2A) and ~30% in HeLa (Fig. 2B). Amino acid sequence silent coding mutation of the U UUA AAC slippery sites to C CUC AAC (the incoming 0-frame codons are indicated by spaces) ablated -1 PRF activity in both cases, to less than 1% (Fig. 2). These findings support the hypothesis that structure and function of the -1 PRF signals has been conserved between the two viruses. Unfortunately, the dual luciferase reporter pJD2359 which was used to generate the other reporters used in this study does not contain the attenuator sequence. Thus, differences in this element were not able to be assayed.<br/><br/>A potential target for antiviral interventions. Mutations that alter rates of -1 PRF efficiency have been shown to be deleterious to replication of SARS-CoV (7, 8). A subsequent study described a series of antisense peptide nucleic acids that inhibited SARS-CoV mediated -1 PRF and virus replication (17), and mRNA pseudoknot dimerization was subsequently shown to be important for -1 PRF activity (18). Separately, a high throughput screening approach was used to identify a small molecule that inhibited SARS-CoV mediated -1 PRF (19). Interestingly, this was shown to limit the conformational plasticity of the -1 PRF stimulating pseudoknot, suggesting that targeting the conformational dynamics of pseudoknots may be an effective strategy for anti-viral drug design (20). Given the >1 year best-case scenario timeframe for development of a vaccine, similar approaches targeting -1 PRF may be of interest for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."

        "Introduction": [
            "SARS-CoV2, the etiological agent of COVID19, is a member of the coronavirus family (1). Coronaviruses have (+) ssRNA genomes that harbor two long open reading frames (ORF) which occupy the 5\u2019 ~ two-thirds of the genomic RNA (ORF1 and ORF2), followed by several ORFs that are expressed late in the viral replication cycle from subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) (Fig. 1A) (2). In general the immediate early proteins encoded by ORF1 are involved in ablating the host cellular innate immune response, while the early proteins encoded in ORF2 are involved in genome replication and RNA synthesis. These functions include generation the minus-strand replicative intermediate, new plus-strand genomic RNAs, and subgenomic RNAs which mostly encode structural, late proteins. ORF2 is out of frame with respect to ORF1, and all coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) as a means to synthesize the ORF2 encoded proteins (3, 4). -1 PRF is a mechanism in which cis-acting elements in the mRNA direct elongating ribosomes to shift reading frame by 1 base in the 5\u2019 direction [reviewed in (3, 4). The use of a -1 PRF mechanism for expression of a viral gene was first published in 1985 for the Rous sarcoma virus (5). A -1 PRF mechanism was shown to be required to translate ORF1ab in a coronavirus, Avain Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), two years later (6). In coronaviruses -1",
            "PRF functions as a developmental switch, and mutations and small molecules that alter this process have deleterious effects on virus replication (7, 8).",
            "The \u20131 PRF signal can be broken down into three discrete parts: the \u201cslippery site\u201d, a linker region, and a downstream stimulatory region of mRNA secondary structure, typically an mRNA pseudoknot [reviewed in (3)]. The primary sequence of the slippery site and its placement in relation to the incoming translational reading frame is critical: it must be N NNW WWZ (codons are shown in the incoming or 0-frame), where N is a stretch of three identical nucleotides, W is either AAA or UUU, and Z \u2260 G. The linker region is less well-defined, but typically is short (1 \u2013 12 nt long) and is thought to be important for determining the extent of \u20131 PRF in a virus-specific manner. The function of the downstream secondary structure is to induce elongating ribosomes to pause, a critical step for efficient \u20131 PRF to occur [reviewed in (9)]. The generally accepted mechanism of \u20131 PRF is that the mRNA secondary structure directs elongating ribosomes to pause with its A- and Psite bound aminoacyl- (aa-) and peptidyl-tRNAs are positioned over the slippery site. The sequence of the slippery site allows for repairing of the tRNAs to the \u20131 frame codons after they \u201csimultaneously slip\u201d by one base in the 5\u2019 direction along the mRNA. The subsequent resolution of the downstream mRNA secondary structure allows the ribosome to continue elongation of the nascent polypeptide in the new translational reading frame. The downstream stimulatory elements are most commonly H-type mRNA pseudoknots, so called because they are composed of two coaxially stacked stem-loops where the second stem is formed by base pairing between sequence in the loop of the first-stem loop, and additional downstream sequence (10). The SARS-CoV pseudoknot is more complex because it contains a third, internal stem-loop element (11\u201313). Mutations affecting this structure decreased rates of -1 PRF, and had deleterious effects on virus propagation, thus suggesting that it may present a target for small molecule therapeutics (7, 8). In addition, the presence of a hairpin located immediately 5\u2019 of the slippery site has been reported to regulate -1 PRF by attenuating its activity (14). Here, we report on the -1 PRF signal from SARS-CoV2. The core -1 PRF signal is nearly identical to the SARS-CoV -1 PRF signal, containing only a single nucleotide difference, a C to A. This change maps to a loop region in the molecule that is not predicted to impact on the structure of the three-stemmed pseudoknot. The attenuator hairpin appears to be less-well conserved. However, functional analyses reveal that both elements promote nearly identical rates of -1 PRF, suggesting that this element has been structurally and functionally conserved."
