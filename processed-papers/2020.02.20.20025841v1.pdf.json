Sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine and faecal specimens as well as whole blood in sodium heparin tubes were collected over the duration of illness and 9 days post discharge for quantitative virology, immunology and assessment of host gene factors. Human experimental work was conducted according to the Declaration of<br/><br/>Helsinki Principles and according to the Australian National Health and Medical<br/><br/>Research Council Code of Practice. Participants provided written informed consent prior to the study. The study was approved by the Royal Melbourne Hospital (HREC<br/><br/>Reference number: HREC/17/MH/53 and HREC/15/MonH/64/2016.196) and<br/><br/>University of Melbourne (ID #1442952.1 and #1443389.4) Human Research Ethics    Committees.<br/><br/>Generation of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA<br/><br/>RNA was extracted from 200\u03bcL from patient\u2019s swabs (nasopharyngeal, rectal, throat in VTM), sputum, urine, faeces and whole-blood samples using the QIAamp 96 Virus<br/><br/>QIAcube HT Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed using the BioLine SensiFAST cDNA kit (Bioline, London, United Kingdom). Total reaction mixture of 20\u03bcl contained 10\u03bcL of the RNA extract, 4\u03bcl of 5x TransAmp buffer, 1\u03bcl of Reverse Transcriptase and 5\u03bcl of Nuclease free water. Reactions were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 15 min, 85\u00b0C for 5 min.<br/><br/>Nested SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing<br/><br/>A PCR mixture containing 2\u03bcl cDNA, 1.6\u03bcl of 25 mM MgCl2, 4\u03bcl of 10x Qiagen Taq<br/><br/>Buffer, 0.4\u03bcl of 20mM dNTPs, 0.3\u03bcl of Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and 2\u03bcl of 10\u03bcM primer pools as described[11]. The first round included the forward (5'-GGKTGGGAYTAYCCKAARTG-3')<br/><br/>and reverse (5'GGKTGGGAYTAYCCKAARTG-3') primers. Cycling conditions were 94\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30s, 48\u00b0C for 30s and 72\u00b0C for 40s, with a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. PCR product (2\u03bcl) was used in the second round<br/><br/>PCR reaction which included the forward (5'-GGTTGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA3') and reverse (5'-CCATCATCAGATAGAATCATCAT-3') primers. Cycling conditions were 94\u00b0C for 10min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30s, 50\u00b0C for 30s and 72\u00b0C for 40s, with a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. PCR products had an expected size of approximately 440bp on a 2% agarose gel.

After the whole blood was stained for 20 mins at room temperature (RT) in the dark, samples were lysed with BD FACS Lysing solution, washed and fixed with 1% PFA. Granzymes/perforin staining (patient d20) was performed using the eBioscience Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set after the lysis step. All the samples were acquired on a LSRII Fortessa (BD). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo v10 software. Healthy donors D1-D5 were of a mean age of 35 (range 24-42 years, 40% females).<br/><br/>Detection of IgG and IgM antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 -infected vero cells<br/><br/>Immunofluorescence antibody tests for the detection of IgG and IgM were performed using SARS-CoV-2-infected vero cells that had been washed with PBS and methanol/acetone fixed onto glass slides. Ten \u03bcL of a 1/20 dilution of patient plasma in PBS from days 7, 8, 9 and 20 were incubated on separate wells for 30 mins at<br/><br/>37\u00b0C, then washed in PBS and further incubated with 10\u03bcL of FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG and IgM (Euroimmun, L\u0171beck, Germany) before viewing on a<br/><br/>EUROStar III Plus fluorescent microscope (Euroimmun). Prior to detection of IgM antibodies, samples were pre-treated with RF-SorboTech (Alere, R\u0171sselsheim, Germany) to remove IgG antibodies and rheumatoid factors, which may cause falsenegative and false-positive IgM results, respectively.

Increased antibody-secreting cells, follicular T-helper cells, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and IgM/IgG SARSCoV-2-binding antibodies were detected in blood, prior to symptomatic recovery.

Clinical examination revealed a temperature of 38.5\u00b0C, pulse rate 120 beats/minute, blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 98%, while breathing ambient air. Lung auscultation revealed bibasal rhonchi. At presentation day (d) 4, SARS-CoV-2 was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. SARS-CoV-2 was again detected at d5-6 from nasopharyneal, sputum and faecal samples, but was undetectable from d7 (Fg.1a). Blood C-reactive protein was elevated at 83.2, with normal lymphocyte counts (4.3x109/L [range 4.012.0x109/L]) and normal neutrophil counts (6.3x109/L [range 2.0-8.0x109/L]). No other respiratory pathogens were detected. Her management was intravenous fluid rehydration without supplemental oxygenation. No antibiotics, steroids or antiviral agents were administered. Chest radiography demonstrated bibasal infiltrates at d5, which cleared on d10 (Fig.1b), and she was discharged to home isolation on d11.",

We propose that these immune parameters should be characterised in larger cohorts of patients with COVID-19 with different disease severity to understand whether they could be used to predict disease outcome and to evaluate new interventions to minimise severity and/or to inform protective vaccine candidates. Furthermore, our study indicates that robust multi-factorial immune responses can be elicited towards the newly-emerged SARS-CoV-2, and similar to the avian H7N9 disease[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], early adaptive immune responses might correlate with better clinical outcomes."
