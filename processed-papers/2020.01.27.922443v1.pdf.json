        "abstract": "A novel coronavirus pneumonia initially identified in Wuhan, China and provisionally named 2019-nCoV has surged in the public. In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human spread, we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this outbreak in Wuhan. We applied a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the specific burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units, given the scenarios of different diagnosis rates as well as different public health intervention efficacy. Our estimates suggest the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported, with estimated 26,701 cases (as of 28th January 2020) assuming 50% diagnosis rate if no public health interventions were implemented. The estimated burdens on healthcare system could be largely reduced if at least 70% efficacy of public health intervention is achieved.",

            "A novel coronavirus pneumonia, initially identified in Wuhan, Central China and now named as 2019-nCoV[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], has surged in the public. With the increasing incidence of confirmed cases, corresponding spread control policies and emergency actions are taking place.<br/><br/>The symptom onset date of the first 2019-nCoV patient was identified in early December 2019 and the outbreak started in late December with most of cases epidemiologically connected to a seafood market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Following the cases reported in other Chinese cities and overseas, the National Health Commission (NHC) of People\u2019s Republic of China confirmed the evidence of human-to-human transmission of such viral pneumonia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. As of 28th January 2020, authorities had reported more than 4,515 confirmed cases across thirteen provinces in mainland China and confirmed 106 deaths. First laboratory-confirmed case was also reported in Taiwan on 21st January, and on the following day, both Hong Kong and Macao reported their first confirmed cases. Globally, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France, Canada, Australia and the United States had reported cases infected by 2019-nCoV.

Discussion/Interpretation In this study, we synthesised available information during the 2019-nCoV outbreak occurring in Wuhan city, China, and estimated the burden on healthcare system effected by the increasing numbers of cases using a modified SIR model. Our results suggest the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported as the spread continues. Therefore, the burdens on healthcare system would be substantial, particularly for the isolation wards and ICU, if no effective public health interventions were implemented.",
            "Our analysis is limited by the availability of data and the lack of understanding of 2019-nCoV. First, SIR model can be substantially affected by the input parameters, i.e., the transition probabilities, which were estimated based on either the data released by the NHC of the People\u2019s Republic of China or other recent investigations. Only the reported incidence between 0:00 and 24:00 on 25 Jan 2020 was used at this stage. As more data become available, further investigation should be considered. Second, classic SIR model assumes a constant infection rate, which is not likely to be true as interventions being implemented. Therefore, in this study, we constructed an SIR model with multiple efficacy rates of public health interventions as proxy for the change of infection rate. Third, the estimated case numbers can be influenced by the diagnosis rate. Therefore, we simulated a number of scenarios with different hypothesised diagnosis rates of 10%, 50% and 90% to estimate the actual number of infected cases. For the reason of mild or moderate symptoms reported by part of infected cases and the relatively long incubation period observed, it is reasonable to model a context of low diagnosis rate. In fact, recent investigation also suggests the current diagnosis rate could be low and likely lower than 10%.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Our estimates appear to be close to the recently published estimates[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "Our results emphasised the vital importance of efficacious public health interventions during the course of outbreak. Established human-to-human transmissibility of this novel coronavirus can be one of epidemiological factors that contribute to the accelerated spreads within the epicentre Wuhan and towards cities and regions via transports of those with no or only subclinical symptoms. It is likely that sustained human transmission (i.e., basic reproduction number R0 > 1) is sufficiently supported by the confirmed human-to-human transability.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Therefore, upstream measures that are able to limit or block the viral transmission between individuals within and across cities are urgently needed. Fortunately, the lockdown of Wuhan city has taken place and is believed to have largely minimised the spreads from the epicentre to other areas. However, the mayor of Wuhan later announced approximately five million of residents had left the city ahead of the implementation of lockdown[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], which may compromise the anti-spread effect of such city lockdown measure as to spreads to other cities. To date, information on transmission modes and severity of this novel coronavirus is still limited [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Further preventive measures to diminish the contact between persons in avoidance of healthcare system breakdown should be implemented, such as school closure, public transport shutdown, common activities suspension, etc.",
            "To achieve higher efficacy of the public health interventions, efforts from individuals should not be neglected. In light of no available specific vaccines and treatments for such novel coronavirus thus far, a range of precautionary behaviours between individuals at homes and in communities are essential and vital to obtain proper control of the spreads in public and likely preventing superspreading events. Personal prevention strategies for seasonal influenza and other viral infections are still applicable during the present outbreak, inclusive of restricting ill residents from common activities, excluding symptomatic persons from entering homes/facilities, limiting visit especially of wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. Maintaining personal hygiene (e.g., frequently performing hand hygiene, washing hands with soap and water) and cough etiquette (e.g., covering nose and mouth when coughing, correctly disposing wasted tissues after coughing) are also beneficial.",
            "Amongst these preventive practices, facemask wear appears to be the most operationalised and thus effective since it is observable from other members of the public. Apart from facemask wear being required in public of the epicentre in Hubei province, it has also been mandated by the Guangdong provincial government that facemasks should be worn in public with effect from 26th January, four days after the implementation in Wuhan. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States, also emphasised the importance of wearing a facemask at all times when staying with infected individuals in shared spaces as specified in their interim guidance for prevention for 2019-nCoV from spreading in home and communities[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. All these are extremely important in raising awareness in the public as to personal preventive steps given the present situation (mild or subclinical symptoms observed in many cases and observed long incubation period). Operational issues associated with wearing disposable facemasks to maximise their preventive effectiveness should be also publicised and educated to the general public including correct ways of wearing facemask, hygiene practices across the procedure of mask wearing, disposal of used masks.",
            "Volunteering from healthcare professionals appears to play a major role in reduction of fears amongst the public. Imported healthcare support from other cities are certainly vital to the healthcare system in Wuhan during the present outbreak.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] It is also noteworthy that volunteers with medical backgrounds (e.g., medical trainees, health science students) are actively instilling scientific insight and evidence-based knowledge via the Internet to eliminate rumours spread across Chinse social media [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. We believe that these volunteering activities can contribute to a successful delivery of public health principle and, in turn, efficacious interventions.",
            "The basic reproductive number of this novel coronavirus has been estimated in recent studies (range from 2.6 to 6.47)[14 20-24], suggesting its spread being as similar as or more efficient than seasonal influenza. Our estimates also indicate that a country-wide outbreak or even an international outbreak is foreseeable. It is thus essential to implement effective public health measures to curb this very outbreak without delay. Otherwise, the current healthcare system would not be able to sustain. Once the breakdown occurred, mortality would be expected to soar due to lack of medical resources. Home isolation for mild patients could be one of possible managements if the ultimate limit of isolation beds at the city or province level was exceeded To conclude, our estimates of the healthcare systems burdens arising from the actual number of cases infected by the novel coronavirus appear to be considerable if no effective public health interventions were implemented. We call for continuation of implemented antitransmission measures (e.g., lockdown of city, closure of schools and facilities, suspension of public transport) and further effective large-scale interventions spanning all subgroups of populations (e.g., universal facemask wear) with an aim to obtain overall efficacy with at least 70%-90% to ensure the functioning of and avoid the breakdown of healthcare system."
