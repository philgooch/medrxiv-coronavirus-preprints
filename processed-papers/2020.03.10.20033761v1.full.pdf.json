Our results suggest that by the time a single death occurs, hundreds to thousands of cases are likely to be present in that population. This suggests containment via contact tracing will be challenging at this point, and other response strategies should be considered. Our approach is implemented in a publicly available, userfriendly, online tool.",

            "Several limitations need to be considered when applying our method. First, our approach only applies to the deaths of patients who have become symptomatic in the location considered, which should usually be the case in places where traveller screening is in place. We also assume constant transmissibility (R) over time, which implies that behaviour change and control measures have not taken place yet, and that there is no depletion of susceptible individuals. Consequently, our method should only be used in the early stages of a new epidemic, where these assumptions are reasonable. Similarly, the assumption that each death reflects independent, additive epidemic trajectories is most likely to hold true early on, when reported deaths are close in time (e.g. no more than a week apart). Used on deaths spanning longer time periods, our approach is likely to overestimate epidemic sizes."

            "As the coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]) epidemic continues to spread worldwide, there is mounting pressure to assess the scale of epidemics in newly affected countries as rapidly as possible. We introduce a method for estimating cases from recently reported COVID-19 deaths. Results suggest that by the time the first deaths have been reported, there may be hundreds to thousands of cases in the affected population. We provide epidemic size estimates for several countries, and a user-friendly, web-based tool that implements our model.",
            "Using deaths to infer cases COVID-19 deaths start to be notified in countries where few or no cases had previously been reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Given the non-specific symptoms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], and the high rate of mild disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], a COVID-19 epidemic may go unnoticed in a new location until the first severe cases or deaths are reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Available estimates of the case fatality ratio, i.e. the proportion of cases that are fatal (CFR, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]), can be used to estimate the number of cases who would have shown symptoms at the same time as the fatal cases. We developed a model to use CFR alongside other epidemiological factors underpinning disease transmission to infer the likely number of cases in a population from newly reported deaths."

            "Contact tracing has been shown to be an efficient control measure when imported cases can be detected early on [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], in addition to permitting the estimation of key epidemiological parameters [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. When the first cases reported in a new location are mostly deaths, however, our results suggest that the underlying size of the epidemic would make control via contact tracing extremely challenging. In such situations, efforts focusing on social distancing measures such as school closures and self-isolation may be more likely to mitigate epidemic spread."
