        "abstract": "Background:\nOn December 31, 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 in humans was reported in Wuhan, and then spread fast to other provinces, China. We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province.\nMethods:\nA confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview.\nResults:\nA total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan.\nConclusions:\nWe observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing. Our findings indicate that human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from family to community in Guangdong Province.",

            "Eighteen years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV in Guangdong at the end of 200216, a great challenge presents by the emergence of a new SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-COV-2). The early epidemiological data suggested that most cases were caused by spill-over infections from nonhuman sources which is still unknown[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. In our study, we described the characteristics of human-to-human transmissions of SARS-COV-2 using epidemiological and genetic evidence.<br/><br/>As of February 10, increasing secondary cases were identified in Guangdong Province. In all 214 secondary cases, none of them had history of residence or traveling to Wuhan within 14 days prior to onset of the illness. Our finding confirms the human-to-human transmission of SARS-COV-2 reported in a familial cluster infection in a previous study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], and further suggests that it has strong transmissibility between humans. We further observed several cases with mild symptoms or no symptoms, which indicates that current monitoring measures such as fever testing may not work effectively to identify these asymptomatic cases. With the epidemic ongoing, we found two cases infected by sharing elevator with an index case in a building, and increasing cases in gathering activities or communities. These findings suggest that the human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from familial cluster infections to community outbreak. More importantly, we observed a nosocomial transmission event in Guangdong Province, which was also reported in a hospital in Wuhan, where 57 patients including 40 health-care workers were infected19. \u201cSuper spreading events\u201d may occur in some specific circumstances such as hospitals if the epidemic was not control on time. As the extended Chinese Spring Festival holiday ends, millions of people will travel back to Guangdong Province from regions across China, which will cause more cases to be imported to the Province. This will further increase the risk of community transmission. Therefore, we should persist in rigorous measures of cutting human-to-human transmission taken by the governments in communities especially in high risk places such as hospitals, factories and schools."

        "Discussion": [
            "Eighteen years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV in Guangdong at the end of 200216, a great challenge presents by the emergence of a new SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-COV-2). The early epidemiological data suggested that most cases were caused by spill-over infections from nonhuman sources which is still unknown[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. In our study, we described the characteristics of human-to-human transmissions of SARS-COV-2 using epidemiological and genetic evidence.",
            "As of February 10, increasing secondary cases were identified in Guangdong Province. In all 214 secondary cases, none of them had history of residence or traveling to Wuhan within 14 days prior to onset of the illness. Our finding confirms the human-to-human transmission of SARS-COV-2 reported in a familial cluster infection in a previous study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], and further suggests that it has strong transmissibility between humans. We further observed several cases with mild symptoms or no symptoms, which indicates that current monitoring measures such as fever testing may not work effectively to identify these asymptomatic cases. With the epidemic ongoing, we found two cases infected by sharing elevator with an index case in a building, and increasing cases in gathering activities or communities. These findings suggest that the human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from familial cluster infections to community outbreak. More importantly, we observed a nosocomial transmission event in Guangdong Province, which was also reported in a hospital in Wuhan, where 57 patients including 40 health-care workers were infected19. \u201cSuper spreading events\u201d may occur in some specific circumstances such as hospitals if the epidemic was not control on time. As the extended Chinese Spring Festival holiday ends, millions of people will travel back to Guangdong Province from regions across China, which will cause more cases to be imported to the Province. This will further increase the risk of community transmission. Therefore, we should persist in rigorous measures of cutting human-to-human transmission taken by the governments in communities especially in high risk places such as hospitals, factories and schools.",
            "The evidence of strong human-to-human transmission raise much concern on 1) whether there are any genetic mutations associated with these cluster infections, and 2) are there any potential viral adaptations leading to the increasing epidemic activity? These questions, which are fundamental to the outbreak control, have not been adequately answered yet. In our study, the viruses sequenced from two secondary cases are the same with the viruses from corresponding index cases in their families, and these secondary cases had no history of traveling to Wuhan and no exposure to wild animals, which indicated that these viruses likely represent strains which can transmit from human to human. We also searched any genetic clues that might be associated with viral adaptation to a human transmission by comparing the viruses from family cluster infections with SARS-CoV-2 from the beginning of epidemic. Only three and one unique SNV sites are identified from viruses sequenced in family infection cluster A and B, respectively. These SNV sites are predicted to result in two synonymous change from Leu to Ser in Orf 8 and from His to",
            "Thr in spike protein, respectively. It is still unknown whether these amino acid changes provide or increase the virus capability of human transmission. However, the previous study from SARS suggests Orf[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] is either noncoding or coding for a functionally unimportant putative protein[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. As a result, few nonsynonymous changes detected between COVID-19 cases from secondary cases in",
            "Guangdong and early COVID-19 cases in Wuhan indicates SARS-CoV-2 could already transmit among humans at the beginning of the epidemic when it was still regarded as spill-over infections.",
            "In this circumstance, more human to human transmissions should occur at the end of December than we previously expected. Another reason that we believe SARS-CoV-2 may be already well established in humans since its first identification is that the SARS-CoV-2 we identified on",
            "January, 23, 2020 were exactly the same with viruses identified in Wuhan on 30 December 2019.",
            "Together with the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences generated on 15 and 22 January, we did not find any clues of adaptations within the genome of SARS-CoV-2 accompany with the increasing epidemic. These data suggest the genetic stability of SARS-CoV-2 during the epidemic, which is a contrast to our previous findings on SARS viruses for which the strong positive selection on spike protein coding sequence and deletions in ORF8 gene are observed at the early phase of the outbreak[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>].",
            "Our findings indicate that with the epidemic ongoing, prevention measures of containing person-to-person transmission in communities are urgently enhanced. Persistent surveillance for",
            "COVID-19 in communities, early detection and isolation of contacts of confirmed cases, and virologic analyses to assess genetic changes that might suggest increased transmissibility among humans are all critical to inform prevention and control efforts and assessing the global pandemic potential of COVID-19."
