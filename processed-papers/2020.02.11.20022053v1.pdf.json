        "abstract": "An increasing number of cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) infected with 2019-nCoV have been identified in Wuhan and other cities in China, since December 2019. We analyzed data on the 17 confirmed cases in Dazhou to provide the epidemiologic characteristics of NCP outside Wuhan. Among them, 12 patients were still quarantined in the hospital, 5 patients were discharged NCP patients according to the national standards. Compared with non-discharged NCP patients, the discharged NCP patients had younger ages. Moreover, discharged NCP patients had higher heart rate, lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels than non-discharged NCP patients on admission to the hospital. Notably, all of 17 patients had abnormal increased C-reactive protein levels, and 16 patients had abnormal computed tomography images. This study provided some information that younger age, higher lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels at the diagnoses of 2019-nCoV may contributed to faster recovery and better therapeutic outcome.",

            "2019-nCoV is a betacoronavirus, like SARS and MERS, and it had infected hundreds of thousands of people since December 2019. There are currently no specific treatments available for 2019-nCoV. Therefore, the main treatment is optimized supportive care to reduce symptoms and maintain organ function in severe diseases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",
            "In our single-center case series of 17 hospitalized patients, it provided information on the epidemiology of the disease outside Wuhan. Routes of infection had no significant difference between discharged NCP patients and non-discharged NCP patients, but most patients had contact history with the epidemic area or close contacts with diagnosed patients. Two non-discharged NCP patients have been living long-term in Dazhou and have no contact history with epidemic area, which implied other possible infective routines.",
            "In our study, the discharged NCP patients had younger ages compared with non-discharged NCP patients and no difference in gender distribution was observed. Our study was different from other reports which reveal that male are more likely to be infected[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Our data also suggested that age may be a risk factor for poor recovery. In addition, discharged NCP patients showed higher lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels on admission to hospital, which suggested immune deficiency nay be also a risk factor for poor outcome in patients. The result was inline with other study that higher level of lymphocyte was presented in the intensive care unit patients compared with that in non- intensive care unit patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Although C-reactive protein levels was abnormal increased in both discharged NCP and non-discharged NCP patients, no significant difference was presented in the two groups. Similar results was observed in lung distribution of patchy shadows or ground glass opacity. This study provided some information that younger age, higher lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels at the diagnoses of",
