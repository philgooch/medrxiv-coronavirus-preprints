The other potential transmission routes remain to be further researched. In some clinical cases, samples of tears and conjunctival secretions from both SARS-CoV[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] and",
            "SARS-CoV-2 patients with conjunctivitis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] displayed detectable viral RNA. A previous study reported the case of a clinician who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while working with patients under all safeguards except eye protection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. By contrast, no SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by RT-PCR in 114 conjunctival swabs samples from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Anatomically, the linkage of the ocular with respiratory tissues is primarily by the nasolacrimal system [5]. The potential extra-respiratory transmissible routes of SARS-CoV-2 via ocular remained unclear.",
            "Whether ocular conjunctiva is one of the portals that SARS-CoV-2 enters the host needs to be further research by laboratory-confirmation for providing significant data to oversight and prevention in people.",
            "50% tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2. Two of them were randomly selected to apply for ocular conjunctival inoculation, the remaining one macaque was inoculated via intratracheal route as a comparison to compare the distribution and pathogenesis of viruses in infected-host via different routes. Based on the clinical symptoms, viral load detection, and serological examination, we tested whether rhesus macaque can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 via ocular conjunctival routes.",
            "We daily observed the macaques for clinical signs. There was no significant clinical change in the body weight (Fig1A) and the temperature (Fig1B) of the inoculated macaques via both routes. Routine specimens, including nose swabs and throat swabs, were collected on 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7-day post-inoculation (dpi). Additionally, conjunctival swabs and anal swabs were also gathered to explore the potentially excretory routes of SARS-CoV-2 in the host. Remarkably, viral load can be tested in conjunctival swabs on 1 dpi via ocular conjunctival route and then became undetectable implying that the inoculated-SARS-CoV-2 may be transferred from conjunctiva to respiratory tract and other tissues. All three animals were able to detect a continued viral load in their nose swabs and throat swabs from 1 to 7 dpi. For anal swabs, inoculated-animals, it can be ongoingly examined in the macaque inoculated via the intratracheal route (Fig1C).",
            "The intratracheal inoculated-macaque and one of the conjunctival inoculated-animal were euthanized and necropsied on 7 dpi. For conjunctival route, viral load was primarily distributed in the nasolacrimal system and ocular, including the lacrimal gland, optic nerve, and conjunctiva nasal cavity; in the nose, including the nasal mucosa, nasal turbinate, and nostril; in the pharynx including epiglottis, soft palate, and trachea; in the oral cavity including check pouch and parotid gland; as well as in other tissues including lower left lobe of the lung, inguinal and para (peri) rectal lymph node, stomach, duodenum, caecum, and ileum (Fig. 1D). By contrast, the distribution of viral might be somewhat different via intratracheal inoculation that viral replication was mainly in the lung, and viral load was also relative high in the nasal septum, tracheas, mandibular lymph node, tonsil, pulmonary lymph node, and some segments of the alimentary tract including caecum, colon, duodenum and jejunum (Fig. 1D). The diverse distributions of viruses by different inoculation routes were consistent with the anatomical structure. Notably, viruses were detectable in different segments of the alimentary canal revealing that the digestive system might be vulnerable and susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in the conjunctival inoculated-macaque at 14 and 21 dpi proofing that the animal was infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1E).",
            "These data suggested that macaques can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 via the conjunctival route. By comparison, viral load and distribution in the conjunctival infected-macaque represented comparatively high in the nasolacrimal system but relatively mild and local in the lung compared with that in the macaque that inoculated via intratracheal routes. Similarly, both the two routes can cause alimentary canal infection.",
            "We inoculated rhesus monkeys via a single route via conjunctiva to avoid multiple routes of co-inoculation for confirming the exact pathway of inoculation. These results suggest that conjunctiva is a portal for viral transmission. In our results, viral load can be detectable in several nasolacrimal system associated-tissues,especially in the conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, nasal cavity and throat, which outlined the anatomical bridge between ocular and respiratory tissues. Particularly, the lacrimal duct functions as a conduit to collect and transport tear fluid from the ocular surface to the nasal-inferior meatus, being convenient for the drainage of the virus from ocular to respiratory tract tissues. Actually, the previous report had demonstrated that although virus-containing fluid can be taken up through the conjunctiva, sclera, or cornea, the majority of liquid including tear and secretions is drained into the nasopharyngeal space or swallowed; the lacrimal duct epithelia are also possible to contribute to the absorption of tear fluid. Our results were highly consistent with the anatomical features that viruses enter the host via the conjunctival route. At present, people mainly wear masks to protect against SARS-CoV-2. This method mainly protects the nasal and oral mucosa. Conjunctiva exposed to the environment is easily overlooked.",
            "Respiratory viruses can stimulate ocular complications in infected patients, which then leads to respiratory infection unprotected eyes increased the risk of SARS-CoV[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] or SARS-CoV-2[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] transmission suggests that increase the awareness of eye protection is necessary, through regular hand-washing in daily life and wearing protective eyewear in close contact with the",
