        "abstract": "Objectives\nThe aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.\nDesign\nThe study was an observational, descriptive study.\nSetting\nThis study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China.\nParticipants\n12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020.\nPrimary and secondary outcome measures\nThe primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), \u03b11-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury.\nResults \nWhile all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury.\nConclusions\nEarly renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.",

            "The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19. Design The study was an observational, descriptive study. Setting This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Participants 12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), \u03b11-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury. Results While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury."

            "Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-strand RNA viruses. In 2014, the International Virological Classification Committee classified them into four genera: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 according to serotype and genomic characteristics. There are six known types of coronaviruses that infect humans: \u03b1-genus 229E, NL63; \u03b2-genus OC43, HKU1, SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Previous case reports suggest that the spectrum of diseases caused by coronavirus infection is polarized. For example, 229E and NL63 in the \u03b1-genus, and OC43 and HKU1 in the \u03b2-genus often cause common colds, which are mainly mild, usually without obvious fever, or only low fever. Usually, it is self-limiting and heals without special treatment. However, the other two coronaviruses in the \u03b2-genus, SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV, often cause acute respiratory syndrome. They mainly cause severe pneumonia, with obvious clinical symptoms, such as fever, dry cough, acute respiratory symptoms and fatigue. Usually, Obvious changes can be found in lung imaging. They are two types of coronavirus pneumonia that require close observation and intensive medical treatment. The 2019-nCov identified this time is a \u03b2-genus coronavirus. The diseases caused by its infection combines the characteristics of the previous six coronaviruses, and the disease spectrum is broad.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]",
            "Peng Zhou et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] reported the identification and characterization of 2019-nCoV. Through full-length genome sequences analysis, they found that the whole genome of 2019-nCoV shared 79.5% sequence identify to SARS-CoV. The pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins showed that this virus belongs to the species of severe acute respirator syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV). In addition, they also confirmed that 2019-nCov used the same cell entry receptor, Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), as SARS-CoV. The high degree of similarity in gene sequence and cellular mechanism of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV suggests that the risk factors of mortality could also be similar. SARS is an acute respiratory infectious disease with pulmonary parenchyma and/or interstitium as the main site of invasion and multiple organ injury. Previous clinical studies have found that, similar to SARS, the causes of death caused by 2019-nCov are not only lung tissue damage, but also heart, liver, kidney and other organ dysfunction or even failure, which is one of the important causes of aggravation and death.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] In the previous SARS case study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], acute renal injury was found to be the top risk factor of mortality, even higher than acute respiratory distress. In that case study, all patients who eventually died had a progressive rise of Scr, and the rise of Scr was rapid in those who succumbed early in their illness. Previously, an ongoing case study reported 59 patients infected by 2019-nCoV, including 28 severe cases and 3 death. In that study, 63% of the patients exhibited proteinuria, and 19% and 27% of the patients had an elevated level of Scr and BUN respectively. Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed abnormal renal imaging in all patients. The results suggested that renal injury was common in COVID-19, which may contribute to multiorgan failure and death eventually.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]",
            "In this study, 12 COVID-19 cases were analyzed. Although all the patients still had normal level of Scr and BUN, the high incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19 was found by calculating eGFR, CCR and UACR. The abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU could be helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19. Furthermore, the study also found that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury. Xin Zou et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing datasets to explore the expression of ACE2 in the main physiological systems of the human body, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary system. The study showed that heart, esophagus, kidney, bladder, and ileum have similar or higher ACE2 expression than in alveoli. In the analysis of specific cell types, the expression of ACE2 in renal proximal tubule cells was about four times higher than that of type II alveolar cells (AT2). The results suggest that the kidney may be one of the primary targets of attack for the 2019-nCov.",
            "Scr and BUN are commonly used indicators for the detection of renal function. However, the sensitivity of both of them is poor. Usually, abnormalities occur only when renal function is significantly damaged, as results, they cannot be used as indicators for evaluating early renal injury. Urine microprotein refers to some proteins that are difficult to detect by conventional qualitative or quantitative methods. The detection of urine microprotein can detect the kidney and some other organs' functional status early. Urine microalbumin is a sensitive indicator of early glomerular injury. Microalbumin has a small molecular weight and is negatively charged. Normally, due to the charge selection barrier of the glomerular filtration membrane, the majority of urine microalbumin cannot pass through the filtration membrane under the action of electrostatic homogeneous repulsion. In the early stage of renal function injury, the charge selectivity of the glomerular filtration membrane decreases, the pore size on the glomerular filtration membrane increases, and the negatively charged structural components of the glomerular filtration membrane change, leading to microalbumin increased excretion from urine.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] Urine \u03b11-microglobulin is an important indicator for monitoring renal tubular injury. It is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 26,000 to 33,000 and is widely distributed in human body. \u03b11-microglobulin can pass through the glomerular filtration membrane, and 95% to 99% is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, and it is not affected by pH. In the early stage of renal injury, the renal tubule reabsorption function reduced, resulting in urine \u03b11-microglobulin excretion increased, and the elevation is consistent with the degree of renal tubular injury.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] Due to the large molecular weight, immunoglobulin G is difficult to pass through the glomerular filtration membrane. When renal function is impaired, it can lead to increased permeability of the glomerular filtration membrane. The excretion of albumin in urine increases, and as the lesions worsen, the excretion of immunoglobulin G in urine also increases. Therefore, the detection of urine immunoglobulin G can help to judge the degree of damage on the glomerular filtration membrane.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] The main physiological function of transferrin is to transport iron ions. It is a negatively charged protein, and its isoelectric point is one unit higher than that of albumin. Normally, it cannot pass through the positively charged glomerular filtration membrane. Urine transferrin is one of the indicators of early glomerular injury, which mainly reflects the damage of glomerular filtration membrane charge selection barrier.[18]",
            "Strengths of this study are as follows: Firstly, this study first investigated the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19 and revealed the prevalence of early renal injury in COVID-19 patients. Secondly, this study clarified the value of multi-index combined detection for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19, and provided a basis for early detection and early intervention. The present study has some limitations that must be taken into account when considering its contribution. First and most significantly is the small sample size of this study. COVID-19 is a newly emerging epidemic. The cases found in this city are all imported cases. After strict prevention and control, there are fewer confirmed cases in this city. Therefore, the number of cases included in this research is also small. In addition, considering COVID-19 is a completely new disease, and we do not yet fully know the characteristics of its cases, the type of research used in this study is designed as a descriptive study, which initially explores the basic characteristics of the disease and does not set the control group."
