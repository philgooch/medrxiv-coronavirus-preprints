            "Since the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China, causing multiple introductions in 109 countries/territories/areas as of March 10th. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan<br/><br/>City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources.",
            "The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerging from China is a deadly respiratory pathogen that belongs to the same family as the coronavirus responsible for the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Since the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread across China as well as caused multiple introductions in countries/territories/areas as of March 10th, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Nevertheless, China has been hit hard by this emerging infectious disease, especially the city of Wuhan in Hubei<br/><br/>Province, where the first cluster of severe pneumonia caused by the novel virus was identified. Meanwhile, the cumulative number of laboratory and clinically confirmed cases and deaths in mainland China has reached 80778 and 3158, respectively, as of<br/><br/>March 10th, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].<br/><br/>Because the morbidity and mortality burden associated with the novel coronavirus has disproportionally affected the city of Wuhan, the center of the epidemic in China, the central government of the People's Republic of China imposed a lockdown and social distancing measures in this city and surrounding areas starting on January<br/><br/>23rd 2020. Indeed, out of the 80778 COVID-19 cases reported in China, 49978 cases (61.9%) are from Wuhan City. In terms of the death count, a total of 2423 deaths (76.7%) have been recorded in Wuhan city out of the 3158 deaths reported throughout<br/><br/>China. To guide the effectiveness of interventions, it is crucial to gauge the uncertainty relating to key epidemiological parameters characterizing the transmissibility and the severity of the disease. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. For this purpose, in this study we employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus."

        "methods": [
            "We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus.<br/><br/>For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory\u2013confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.<br/><br/>board government\u2013chartered flights were integrated into our analysis.",
            "Epidemiological data<br/><br/>We linked our model to two different datasets. First, the daily series of laboratory\u2013confirmed nCov cases and deaths in Wuhan City were extracted according to date of symptoms onset or reporting date from several sources [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Our analysis relies on epidemiological data reported prior to February 11th, 2020 because of the change in case definition that was announced on February 12th, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. As of<br/><br/>February 11th, 2020, a total of 19559 confirmed cases including 820 deaths were reported in Wuhan City. Second, epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from<br/><br/>Wuhan City on board government\u2013chartered flights were obtained from the Japanese government. After arriving in Japan, all of the Japanese evacuees were kept in isolation for about 14 days and examined for infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)<br/><br/>tests [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. As of February 11th, a total of four flights with the Japanese evacuees left<br/><br/>Wuhan City. We collected information on the timing of the evacuee fights that left<br/><br/>Wuhan City as well as the number of passengers that tested positive for COVID-19 in order to calibrate our model (Table S1).<br/><br/>Statistical analysis<br/><br/>Using the following integral equation model, we estimate the reproduction number of COVID-19. Here, infected and reported cases are denoted by i and c, respectively.<br/><br/>We connected the daily incidence series with a discrete\u2013time integral equation to describe the epidemic dynamics. Let gs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval, e.g., the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in the secondary case, of length s days, which is given by s  s  1 , For s >0 where G(.) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution. Mathematically, we describe the expected number of new cases with day t, E[c(t)] as follows,<br/><br/>E        , where E[c(t)] represents the expected number of new cases with onset day t, where R represents the average number of secondary cases per case.<br/><br/>Subsequently, we also employed the time\u2013dependent variation in R to take into account the impact of enhanced interventions on the transmission potential. This time dependence was modelled by introducing a parameter \u03b41, which is given by if     !<br/><br/>if where period1 and period2 represent the corresponding period from January 23rd to    February 2nd<br/><br/>January 23rd 2020 is the date when the central government of the People's Republic of and from February 3rd to February 11th, 2020, respectively.<br/><br/>China imposed a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei in an effort to quarantine the epicentre of the coronavirus (COVID-19) to mitigate transmission. Furthermore, we evenly divide the interval into two periods to incorporate the time-dependent effects on<br/><br/>R using the parameters \u03b21 and \u03b22 which scale the extent of the intervention, taking values smaller than 1[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].<br/><br/>To account for the probability of occurrence, \u03b8 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] ,we assume that the number of observed cases on day t, h(t), occurred according to a Bernoulli sampling process, with the expected values E(ct;Ht\u20131), where E(ct; Ht\u20131) denotes the conditional expected incidence on day t, given the history of observed data from day 1 to day (t\u20131), denoted by Ht\u20131. Thus, the number of expected newly observed cases is written as follows:    E  ; #   $    1  % & %E ; # ,<br/><br/>%E ; # , if   0 , otherwise, Further, we model the time\u2013dependent variation in the reporting probability.<br/><br/>This time dependence was modelled by introducing a parameter \u03b42, which is given by otherwise, where period3 and period4 represent the corresponding periods from the start of our study period to Jan 16 and from Jan 17 to Jan 22, respectively, while \u03b11 and \u03b12 scale the extent of the reporting probability (where \u03b11 and \u03b12 is expected to be smaller than 1).<br/><br/>We evenly divide the duration before the lockdown was put in place into two to incorporate the time dependency of the reporting probability. The number of expected newly observed cases should be updated as    E ; #   $    1  % & /%E ; # ,<br/><br/>/%E ; # , if   0 , otherwise, We assume the incidence, h(t) is the result of the Binomial sampling process with the expectation E[h]. The likelihood function for the time series of observed cases that we employ to estimate the effective reproduction number and other relevant parameters is given by:    ; #  1    4/    0 1;   2 3<br/><br/>1  /  ; where U indicates parameter sets that are estimated from this likelihood.<br/><br/>Subsequently, the conditional probability of non\u2013infection given residents in<br/><br/>Wuhan City at the time point of ti, pti, was assumed to follow a binomial distribution, and the likelihood function is given by:    \u0cd4    \u0cdf\u0cd4    \u0cdf\u0cd4 \u0cdf\u0cd4<br/><br/>Where Mti and mti is the number of government charted flight passengers and non\u2013infected passengers at the date of ti, respecitively, and pti is the proportion of the estimated non\u2013infected population in Wuhan at the date of ti, calculated from the h(t) and catchment population in Wuhan City [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].<br/><br/>Serial interval estimates of COVID-19 were derived from previous studies of nCov, indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and SD at 7.5 and<br/><br/>3.4 days, respectively, based on ref. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 28 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 28 days reaches 0.999.<br/><br/>Infection fatality ratio<br/><br/>Crude CFR and crude IFR is defined as the number of cumulative deaths divided by the number of cumulative cases or infections at a specific point in time without adjusting the time delay from illness onset or hospitalization to death. Next, we employed an integral equation model in order to estimate the real\u2013time IFR. First, we estimated the real\u2013time CFR as described elsewhere [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. For the estimation, we employ the delay from hospitalization to death, fs, which is assumed to be given by fs =<br/><br/>F(s) \u2013 F(s\u20131) for s>0 where H(s) follows a gamma distribution with mean 10.1 days and<br/><br/>SD 5.4 days, obtained from the available observed data [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>].    \u2211 \u2211    ?    9;  , %  2 :    < , =9    @ =1    \u2211    ;    \u0cdf    \u2211\u0cdf\u0c38\u0c2d    @    \u0cdf \u0cdf\u0cd4<br/><br/>where ct represents the number of new cases with reported day t, and Dti is the number of new deaths with reported day ti [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. We assume that the cumulative number of observed deaths, Dt is the result of the binomial sampling process with probability \u03c0.<br/><br/>Subsequently, crude IFR and time\u2013delay adjusted IFR are calculated using the estimated \u03c0 and ht.<br/><br/>The total likelihood is calculated as L=L1L2L3 and model parameters were estimated using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method in a Bayesian framework. Posterior distributions of the model parameters were estimated based on sampling from the three Markov chains. For each chain, we drew 100,000 samples from the posterior distribution after a burn\u2013in of 20,000 iterations. Convergence of MCMC chains were evaluated using the potential scale reduction statistic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Estimates and<br/><br/>95% credibility intervals for these estimates are based on the posterior probability distribution of each parameter and based on the samples drawn from the posterior distributions. All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.5.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) using the \u2018rstan\u2019 package."

            "In this study we derived estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of<br/><br/>COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. Applying dynamic modeling, the reproduction number and death risks as well as probabilities of occurrence and reporting rate were estimated.<br/><br/>in 2019\u20132020 is calculated to be as high as 5.20 (95%CrI: 5.04\u20135.47). The time\u2013dependent scaling factor quantifying the extent of enhanced public health intervention on R is 0.99 (95%CrI: 0.94\u20131.00), declining R to 5.12 (95%CrI: 4.98\u20135.26)<br/><br/>(95%CrI: 0.51\u20130.64) for February 2nd to February 11th, 2020. These R estimates capturing the underlying transmission dynamics modify the impact of COVID-19, with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526<br/><br/>(95%CrI: 1350283\u2013 2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95%CrI: 13.5\u201326.6%) with a catchment population in Wuhan<br/><br/>City of 10 million people. Our estimates of mean reproduction number reached values as high as 5.20, an estimate that is slightly higher than previous mean estimates in the range 2.2-3.8 derived by fitting epidemic models to the initial growth phase of the observed case incidence [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. By comparison, the R estimate for the Diamond<br/><br/>Princess cruise ship in Japan reached values as high as ~11 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Further, these estimates are higher than recent mean R estimates derived from the growth rates of the COVID-19 outbreaks in Singapore (R~1.1) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] and Korea (R~1.5) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].<br/><br/>The sustained high R values in Wuhan City even after the lockdown and mobility restrictions suggests that transmission is occurring inside the household or amplified in healthcare settings [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], which is a landmark of past SARS and MERS outbreaks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Considering the potent transmissibility of COVID-19 in confined settings, as illustrated by COVID-19 outbreaks aboard cruise ships, including the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where the total number of secondary or tertiary infections reached 705 among more than 3,700 passengers as of February 28th, 2020 and also by the COVID-19 outbreak tied to the Shincheonji religious sect in South Korea where church members appear to have infected from seven to 10 people. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], it is crucial to prevent transmission in confined settings including hospital-based transmission by strengthening infection control measures as well as transmission stemming from large social gatherings.<br/><br/>Our most recent estimates of the crude CFR and time\u2013delay adjusted CFR are at 4.2% (95% CrI: 3.9\u20134.9%) and 12.23% (95% CrI: 11.4\u201313.0%), respectively. In contrast, our most recent crude IFR and time\u2013delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be<br/><br/>0.04% (95% CrI: 0.03%\u20130.06%) and 0.12% (95%CrI: 0.08\u20130.17%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR at 4.19%. These findings indicate that the death risk in Wuhan is estimated to be much higher than those in other areas, which is likely explained by hospital-based transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. Indeed, past nosocomial outbreaks have been reported to elevate the CFR associated with MERS and SARS outbreaks, where inpatients affected by underlying disease or seniors infected in the hospital setting have raised the CFR to values as high as 20% for a MERS outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>].<br/><br/>Public health authorities are interested in quantifying R and CFR to measure the transmission potential and virulence of an infectious disease, especially when emerging/re\u2013emerging epidemics occur in order to decide the intensity of the public health response. In the context of a substantial fraction of unobserved infections due to<br/><br/>COVID-19, R estimates derived from the trajectory of infections and the IFR are more realistic indicators compared to estimates derived from observed cases alone [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>].<br/><br/>Our analysis also revealed a high probability of occurrence and quite low reporting probabilities in Wuhan City. High probability of occurrence in the above equation suggests that zero observed cases at some point is not due to the absence of those infected, but more likely due to a low reporting rate. A very low reporting probability suggests that it is difficult to diagnose COVID-19 cases or a breakdown in medical care delivery. Moreover, we also identified a remarkable change in the reporting rate, estimated to be 12\u2013fold lower in the 1st period (\u2013Jan 16, 2020) and about the same during the 2nd period (January 17th \u2013 22nd , 2020), relative to the that estimated after January 23rd 2020.<br/><br/>Our results are not free from the limitations. First, our methodology aims to capture the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. By implementing mass screening in certain populations is a useful approach to ascertain the real proportion of those infected and a way of adding credibility to the estimated values. Second, it is worth noting that the data of Japanese evacuee employed in our analysis is not a random sample from the Wuhan catchment population. Indeed, it also plausible that their risk of infection in this sample is not as high as that of local residents in Wuhan, underestimating the fatality risk."

            "The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerging from China is a deadly respiratory pathogen that belongs to the same family as the coronavirus responsible for the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Since the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread across China as well as caused multiple introductions in countries/territories/areas as of March 10th, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Nevertheless, China has been hit hard by this emerging infectious disease, especially the city of Wuhan in Hubei",
            "Province, where the first cluster of severe pneumonia caused by the novel virus was identified. Meanwhile, the cumulative number of laboratory and clinically confirmed cases and deaths in mainland China has reached 80778 and 3158, respectively, as of",
            "March 10th, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",
            "Because the morbidity and mortality burden associated with the novel coronavirus has disproportionally affected the city of Wuhan, the center of the epidemic in China, the central government of the People's Republic of China imposed a lockdown and social distancing measures in this city and surrounding areas starting on January",
            "23rd 2020. Indeed, out of the 80778 COVID-19 cases reported in China, 49978 cases (61.9%) are from Wuhan City. In terms of the death count, a total of 2423 deaths (76.7%) have been recorded in Wuhan city out of the 3158 deaths reported throughout",
            "China. To guide the effectiveness of interventions, it is crucial to gauge the uncertainty relating to key epidemiological parameters characterizing the transmissibility and the severity of the disease. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. For this purpose, in this study we employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus."

            "Princess cruise ship in Japan reached values as high as ~11 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Further, these estimates are higher than recent mean R estimates derived from the growth rates of the COVID-19 outbreaks in Singapore (R~1.1) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] and Korea (R~1.5) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].",
            "The sustained high R values in Wuhan City even after the lockdown and mobility restrictions suggests that transmission is occurring inside the household or amplified in healthcare settings [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], which is a landmark of past SARS and MERS outbreaks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Considering the potent transmissibility of COVID-19 in confined settings, as illustrated by COVID-19 outbreaks aboard cruise ships, including the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where the total number of secondary or tertiary infections reached 705 among more than 3,700 passengers as of February 28th, 2020 and also by the COVID-19 outbreak tied to the Shincheonji religious sect in South Korea where church members appear to have infected from seven to 10 people. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], it is crucial to prevent transmission in confined settings including hospital-based transmission by strengthening infection control measures as well as transmission stemming from large social gatherings.",

These findings indicate that the death risk in Wuhan is estimated to be much higher than those in other areas, which is likely explained by hospital-based transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. Indeed, past nosocomial outbreaks have been reported to elevate the CFR associated with MERS and SARS outbreaks, where inpatients affected by underlying disease or seniors infected in the hospital setting have raised the CFR to values as high as 20% for a MERS outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>].",

            "Our analysis also revealed a high probability of occurrence and quite low reporting probabilities in Wuhan City. High probability of occurrence in the above equation suggests that zero observed cases at some point is not due to the absence of those infected, but more likely due to a low reporting rate. A very low reporting probability suggests that it is difficult to diagnose COVID-19 cases or a breakdown in medical care delivery. Moreover, we also identified a remarkable change in the reporting rate, estimated to be 12\u2013fold lower in the 1st period (\u2013Jan 16, 2020) and about the same during the 2nd period (January 17th \u2013 22nd , 2020), relative to the that estimated after January 23rd 2020.",
            "Our results are not free from the limitations. First, our methodology aims to capture the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. By implementing mass screening in certain populations is a useful approach to ascertain the real proportion of those infected and a way of adding credibility to the estimated values. Second, it is worth noting that the data of Japanese evacuee employed in our analysis is not a random sample from the Wuhan catchment population. Indeed, it also plausible that their risk of infection in this sample is not as high as that of local residents in Wuhan, underestimating the fatality risk."
