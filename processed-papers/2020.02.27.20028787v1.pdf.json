            "In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as novel coronavirus\u2013infected pneumonia (NCIP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. By February 27, 2020, there were 78630 confirmed cases reported in China, and tragically we have now surpassed 2747 people in China have lost their lives because of this virus. Most of the cases and most of the deaths are in Hubei province, Wuhan. Outside China, there are 3545 cases in 40 countries, and 35 death. The type of pneumonia caused by the 2019<br/><br/>novel coronavirus is a highly infectious disease, and the ongoing outbreak has been declared by WHO as a global public health emergency.<br/><br/>A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that 2019-nCoV is a distinct clade from the beta coronaviruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses(ICTV)is announced that 2019-nCoV is officially classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the official name of the disease caused by this virus is Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].<br/><br/>Huang et al first reported 41 cases of NCIP in which most patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Patients\u2019 clinical manifestations included fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, normal or decreased leukocyte counts, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Organ dysfunction (eg, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury and death can occur in severe cases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Although most patients present with mild febrile illness with patchy pulmonary inflammation, a significant portion develop severe ARDS, with a current case fatality of 4.3%[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].<br/><br/>Diagnosis is based on clinical history and laboratory and chest radiographic findings, but confirmation currently relies on nucleic acid-based assays. The nucleic acid-based assay has been used to confirm the diagnosis of new pneumonia, but many patients will miss the diagnosis. We have verified the two new reagents kit that are currently not on the market and have achieved good results. The following are reported as follows: Materials and Methods Study Design and Participants<br/><br/>This case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. All consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Jinyintan Hospital from January 1 to January 28, 2020, were enrolled. Oral consent was obtained from patients. Jinyintan Hospital, located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the endemic areas of COVID-19, is first designated hospital for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. All patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. The remaining serum samples for clinical testing were collected from two groups of patients. One group collected 63 samples from February 2, 2020 for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples from February 3-4, 2020 for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA), of which 81 cases took throat swab sample for nucleic acids (Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay, qRT-PCR) detection. 35 healthy individuals served as controls in both groups.<br/><br/>ELISA The novel coronavirus IgG/IgM antibody ELISA kits (lot number 2020010108)<br/><br/>were manufactured by Zhu Hai Liv Zon Diagnostics Inc. The 98 serum samples were tested according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. IgM capture ELISA: Firstly, \u03bc \u03bc \u03bc 5 L serum samples were diluted in 500 L sample diluent. Then added 100 L diluted samples to duplicate wells of microplates which were coated with mouse \u03bc anti-human IgM monoclonal antibody ( chain), and incubated for 60 min at 37 \u00b11 .<br/><br/>\u03bc Plates were washed five times and reacted with 100 L enzyme marker (enzyme-labeled antibody-linked antigen) for 30 min at 37 \u00b11\u00b0C for the purpose of \u03bc detecting IgM against new coronavirus in serum samples. IgG indirect ELISA:5 L \u03bc serum samples diluted in 100 L sample diluent were added to duplicate wells of microplates which were coated with recombinant antigen of new coronavirus, and incubated for 60 min at 37 \u00b11 . Plates were washed five times and reacted with 100<br/><br/>\u03bcL enzyme marker (HRP-conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG) for 30 min at 37 \u00b11 \u00b0C for the purpose of detecting IgG against new coronavirus in serum \u03bc \u03bc samples. Plates were then washed five times, and 50 L substrate buffer and 50 L tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution were added to each well for a chromogenic reaction for 15 min at 37 \u00b11 \u00b0C. The color reaction was stopped by the \u03bc addition 50 L of 2 M H2SO4 to each well. Finally, the OD450 was measured and recorded immediately using an Infinite 200 PRO microplatereader.<br/><br/>GICA The novel coronavirus IgG/IgM antibody GICA kits (lot number 2001010220) were manufactured by Zhu Hai Liv Zon Diagnostics Inc, China. The 126 serum samples \u03bc were tested according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For each test, 10 L of serum \u03bc sample and 100 L of sample diluent were added vertically onto the sample pad of the test strip. The strip was then placed flat to allow the solution to migrate up the membrane, through gold-labeled pad, the testing area, quality control area and finally to adsorption zone. After 10 min, the result was judged by the color of the test and control lines. If both the detection band and the control band turned red, the sample was recorded as positive. If the control band turned red but the detection band was not colored, it was recorded as negative. If neither band was colored, the test reagents were assumed to be not working.<br/><br/>qRT-PCR Assay for SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>Throat swab samples, sputum samples and alveolar lavage fluid samples were collected for extracting 2019-nCoV RNA from patients suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection. After collection, the throat swabs were placed into a sterile test tube with 1 ml sterile saline, the sputum samples were added equal volume of acetylcysteine (10g/L) and shaken at room temperature for 30 min to be fully liquefied, and total RNA was extracted using the nucleic acid extraction kit (QIAamp \u03bc viral RNA mini kit). In brief, 40 L of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifugated at 1000 rpm/min for 5 minutes. The \u03bc suspension was used for qRT-PCR assay of 2019-nCoV RNA. Then, n*19 L mixed \u03bc reagent of fluorescence PCR detection for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid and n* 1 L<br/><br/>RT-PCR enzyme (n was the number of reaction tubes) were mixed and vortexed for a \u03bc few seconds. The above mixture of 20 L was put into the PCR reaction tube \u03bc respectively, after that the extracted sample by 5 L was added. qRT-PCR analysis was conducted using the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System. The PCR parameters were 45 \u00b0C for 10 min, 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 58 \u00b0C for 30 s, and a single fluorescence detection point at 58\u00b0C. Two target genes, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), were simultaneously amplified and tested during the qRT-PCR assay. The qRT-PCR assay was performed using a 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co Ltd). A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). A medium load, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting.<br/><br/>Statistical Analysis<br/><br/>All analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies (percentages), and performed using the chi-square test with Yates\u2019s correction or Fisher\u2019s exact test, as appropriate. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. For multiple statistical comparisons, chi-square test was corrected by Bonferroni's correction (0.05/test numbers)."

        "discussion": [
            "At present, the sample collection for nucleic acid detection of suspected cases of COVID-19 is mostly upper respiratory tract samples (mainly throat swabs) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. The collection of throat swabs is not standardized and it is easy to miss the diagnosis. The collection process is extremely risky for medical staff. Confirmed diagnosis is playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. A fast-performing serologic assay is acutely needed for the current and outbreak.<br/><br/>In this study, we tested serum samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients with two assay kits and achieved a high positive rate. The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and IgG detection was 55/63 (87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and IgG detection was 75/91 (82.4%), and the healthy controls were negative. The case group was COVID-19 patients diagnosed by qRT-PCR. Since many patients are undergoing treatment, they are gradually recovering, the nucleic acid test result has become negative, so the positive rate of patients tested was only 51.9%.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that the new type of coronavirus antibody of the kit is against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus, not only against SARS-CoV-2, but the IgG originally infected with SARS may also be positive. But our research found, the healthy controls are all negative and the specificity is very good.<br/><br/>ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies is conventional serological assays, they can offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected patients. They use plasma or serum as test samples, and blood samples can be collected easily, which can greatly reduce the risk of infection for medical staff. The complicated processing procedure of the sample during the laboratory test is removed, the test result can be obtained quickly, the operation is simple, the safety of medical staff can be protected, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.<br/><br/>Although ELISA and GICA are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference. Cases confirmation still depended on qRT-PCR, and analyze epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and other laboratory data. There is a need to further increase the number of samples tested to prove their t of sample testing to confirm their significance.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies is conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe for diagnosis COVID-19. The results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved."

            "A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that 2019-nCoV is a distinct clade from the beta coronaviruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].

Patients\u2019 clinical manifestations included fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, normal or decreased leukocyte counts, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Organ dysfunction (eg, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury and death can occur in severe cases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].

For each test, 10 L of serum \u03bc sample and 100 L of sample diluent were added vertically onto the sample pad of the test strip. The strip was then placed flat to allow the solution to migrate up the membrane, through gold-labeled pad, the testing area, quality control area and finally to adsorption zone. After 10 min, the result was judged by the color of the test and control lines. If both the detection band and the control band turned red, the sample was recorded as positive. If the control band turned red but the detection band was not colored, it was recorded as negative. If neither band was colored, the test reagents were assumed to be not working.",
            "Throat swab samples, sputum samples and alveolar lavage fluid samples were collected for extracting 2019-nCoV RNA from patients suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection.

Two target genes, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), were simultaneously amplified and tested during the qRT-PCR assay. The qRT-PCR assay was performed using a 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co Ltd). A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test.

        "Discussion": [
            "At present, the sample collection for nucleic acid detection of suspected cases of COVID-19 is mostly upper respiratory tract samples (mainly throat swabs) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. The collection of throat swabs is not standardized and it is easy to miss the diagnosis. The collection process is extremely risky for medical staff. Confirmed diagnosis is playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. A fast-performing serologic assay is acutely needed for the current and outbreak.",
            "In this study, we tested serum samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients with two assay kits and achieved a high positive rate. The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and IgG detection was 55/63 (87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and IgG detection was 75/91 (82.4%), and the healthy controls were negative. The case group was COVID-19 patients diagnosed by qRT-PCR. Since many patients are undergoing treatment, they are gradually recovering, the nucleic acid test result has become negative, so the positive rate of patients tested was only 51.9%.",
            "It is worth noting that the new type of coronavirus antibody of the kit is against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus, not only against SARS-CoV-2, but the IgG originally infected with SARS may also be positive. But our research found, the healthy controls are all negative and the specificity is very good.",
            "ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies is conventional serological assays, they can offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected patients. They use plasma or serum as test samples, and blood samples can be collected easily, which can greatly reduce the risk of infection for medical staff. The complicated processing procedure of the sample during the laboratory test is removed, the test result can be obtained quickly, the operation is simple, the safety of medical staff can be protected, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.",
            "Although ELISA and GICA are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference. Cases confirmation still depended on qRT-PCR, and analyze epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and other laboratory data. There is a need to further increase the number of samples tested to prove their t of sample testing to confirm their significance.",
            "In conclusion, ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies is conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe for diagnosis COVID-19. The results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved."
