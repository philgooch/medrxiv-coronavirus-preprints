            "In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia known as 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China.",
            "A total of 1,524 cancer patients who were managed at the tertiary cancer institution \u2013 Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were reviewed during the period of Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020.",
            "It was found that cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population."

            "For cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "This new type of pneumonia is linked to the severe adult respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission, patients would develop progressive respiratory symptoms upon infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Droplet transmission appears to be the main route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2.2 According to a recent report of 138 hospitalized patients from a single institution (Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University), it was indicated that hospital-acquired transmission accounts for 41.3% of these admitted patients (29% were hospital staff and 12.3% were in-house patients), thereby highlighting that the hospital environment may be a hotspot for viral spread.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Among the different disease types, cancer patients are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance, and they may be at an elevated risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2.",
            "The majority of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive.",
            "The authors report the incidence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients who were managed at a tertiary cancer institution in Wuhan.",
            "The authors estimated that the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients from the single institution at 0.79% (95% CI = 0.3\u20131.2).",
            "Five (41.7%) were on-going treatment with either chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy (N = 3) or radiotherapy (N = 2; one patient was undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy).",
            "4 Based on the single institution data, the authors observed that cancer patients from the epicenter of a viral epidemic harbor a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.89-3.02) when compared to the general community.",
            "Regardless, the findings do imply that hospital admission and recurrent hospital visits are potential risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and these factors may account for the increased incidence among cancer patients."
