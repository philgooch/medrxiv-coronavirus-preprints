            "Since Dec 2019, a series of acute respiratory illness outbreaks in Wuhan, Hubei<br/><br/>Province, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The disease has been subsequently identified in other provinces in China, and other counties. On Jan 7, a novel coronavirus was identified by deep sequencing analysis of samples from throat swabs and lower respiratory tract.<br/><br/>The disease caused by the novel virus is now named by WHO as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Epidemiological research shows that all infected patients had travel or residence records in Wuhan, suggesting the possibility of person-to-person transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. By Feb 22, 2020, more than 75,000 confirmed cases, including 1716 health-care workers, have been identified in China. And 989 patients have been diagnosed in Anhui Province, including 6 deaths.<br/><br/>The novel coronaviruse is an enveloped non-segmented positive sense RNA virus belonging to the betacoronaviruses. The well-known atypical pneumonia virus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Virus (MERS-CoV) are also betacoronaviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, myalgia and fatigue. Symptoms of headache, expectoration, and diarrhea seem to less common. Radiographic evidence suggested pneumonia. About half of patients have developed severe pneumonia. Nearly one third of patients require intensive care because of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].<br/><br/>At present, there are relatively few reports about novel coronavirus pneumonia in<br/><br/>Anhui Province. Here, we described the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of 75 COVID-19 confirmed patients admitted to the First Affiliated<br/><br/>Hospital of USTC, Hefei. This study will be beneficial for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients in clinical practice."

            "Patients<br/><br/>In this study, we eventually enrolled 75 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC between Jan 21, and Feb 16, 2020. Most patients came to the hospital because of fever or respiratory symptoms. Our clinical team consulted and recorded their epidemiological history in detail regarding to whether they had been to Wuhan or exposed to people who came from Wuhan recently. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were taken for respiratory pathogens test. The physical findings, hematological, biochemical and radiological results were also recorded. All patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. All patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC ."

            "Respiratory nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and the presence of COVID-19 was detected by next real-time RT-PCR methods. Viral RNA was extracted using<br/><br/>QIAamp RNA virus Kit (Qiagen, Heiden, Germany). The diagnostic test was done using a commercial coronavirus test kit (Shenzhen Huada Yinyuan Pharmaceutical<br/><br/>Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen). The specific primers and probe targeted to nucleocapsidprotein (N) were used and the sequences were as follows: forward primer<br/><br/>5\u2032-GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG-3\u2032; 5'-FAM-TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3'.<br/><br/>amplifications were 50\u00b0C for 20 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 60\u00b0C reverse and primer the<br/><br/>Conditions probe for the for 30 s. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. A medium load, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, requires a retesting according to the guideline (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html).    of    Chinese    Centers for    Disease    Control and    Prevention<br/><br/>We also examined other respiratory viruses, including influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV and<br/><br/>MERS-CoV, with realtime RT-PCR. Hematological parameters including blood routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation profile, and infection-related biomarkers were recorded.

            "This report, to our knowledge, is the first case series of patients with COVID-19 in<br/><br/>Anhui Province. As most patients remain hospitalized, we focus on the clinical and laboratory profiles upon their admission. Epidemiological research shows that most patients have been to Wuhan recently. Common symptoms were fever, cough, and chest tightness. However, a significant proportion of patients presented with atypical symptoms such as fatigue, muscle soreness and diarrhea. We also pay attention to patients without fever in which cough may be the only or primary symptom.<br/><br/>Therefore, to avoid further transmission, screening and closely monitoring of each suspect remain important. Further studies on the epidemiological characteristics of these atypical cases are recommended.<br/><br/>The most common laboratory abnormalities observed in this study were decreased total lymphocytes, prolonged APTT, elevated LDH, CRP and ESR. Similarities abnormalities between COVID-19 and previously observed betacoronavirus, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, have been noted [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. These findings suggest that COVID-19 can cause different degrees of hematological abnormalities and damage of internal organs. The absolute value of lymphocytes was reduced in more than 50% patients. The most significant was the decreased CD4+ T cell counts.<br/><br/>Previous studies of patients in Wuhan suggested virus invasion could induce a cytokine storm syndrome (CRS) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Of the 14 patients with elevated IL-6, LYM%, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts were significantly decreased and NEU%, CRP and<br/><br/>LDH levels increased significantly. Elevated IL-6 may be an important factor leading to T lymphocytes damage and cellular immune deficiency. IL-6 could also be used as an indicator to evaluate infection severity. Therefore, we conclude that IL-6 may be an effective target for prevention or treatment of serve COVID-19 infection. Future large-scale studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.<br/><br/>COVID-19 belongs to the betacoronavirus. As a single-stranded positive-sense<br/><br/>RNA virus, COVID-19 has 79.5% homology with SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Similar to<br/><br/>SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is also the cellular entry receptor of COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. ACE2 is highly expressed in human lung tissue, gastrointestinal tract, vascular endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].<br/><br/>Therefore, all of the organs above may be targets for virus attack. ACE2 effectively hydrolyzes the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to angiotens and is related to hypertension, cardiac function and diabetes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Liu et al discovered that the<br/><br/>Angiotensin II level in the plasma samples increased markedly, suggesting that<br/><br/>COVID-19 could induce imbalanced renin-angiotensin system. Drugs of ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may be used as potential treatment of COVID-19 infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. As we can see, in patients with underlying diseases, most of them have hypertension. However, no report has focused on the correlation between antihypertensive agents with COVID-19 infection or disease severity. Studies are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of ACEI and ARB in the future.<br/><br/>Currently, there is no specific therapy for patients with new coronavirus pneumonia.<br/><br/>The pathologic mechanisms of disease progression and exacerbation are also unclear.<br/><br/>How to relieve the clinical symptoms of critically ill patients, and reduce the severity and mortality of patients still remains challenging. Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and COVID-19, some pre-clinical drugs against SARS-CoV have been applied to COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir (RDV), a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide analogue, is reported to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections effectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. A randomized controlled trial was initiated to determine the safety and efficacy of RDV in patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China recently. It is crucial to determine host tropism and transmission capacity in terms of prevention of the virus infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Spike (S) protein mediates membrane fusion through binding with ACE2. Monoclonal antibody against the S protein may efficiently block the virus from entering the host. Convalescent plasma had also been reported to be clinically useful to SARS and MERS patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. If available, convalescent plasma should be used for critically ill patients with COVID-19.<br/><br/>However, the appearance of therapeutic plasma requires time and exists only in recovered patients. In our opinion, comprehensive and supportive treatments are essential in the early stage. Additionally, antiviral treatment in early stage and immune activation blockers such as IL-6 blockers, IL-1 blockers in late stage could be tried to control further disease progress leading to ARDS due to excessive immune activation.<br/><br/>Targeted treatment should depend on individual differences due to various disease characteristics.<br/><br/>This study has several limitations. First, only 75 patients with confirmed<br/><br/>COVID-19 were included. It would be better to include as many patients as possible to get a more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19. Second, more detailed patient information, particularly treatment strategies and clinical outcomes, was unavailable at the time of analysis. Regarding the inflammatory factors, we only measured IL-6 level changes. Future studies should focus on changes of various pro-inflammatory factors, ie IL-1, which may provide precise target treatment options for different patients.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this study provides an early assessment of the clinical and laboratory profiles of COVID-19 patients in Hefei, China. The clinical manifestation of<br/><br/>COVID-19 was nonspecific. Specific coronavirus antivirals show proven efficacies in humans are unavailable to date. Antiviral therapy requires a comprehensive and supportive treatment. Targeted therapy should also be determined based on individual clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators."

Convalescent plasma had also been reported to be clinically useful to SARS and MERS patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. If available, convalescent plasma should be used for critically ill patients with COVID-19.",
            "However, the appearance of therapeutic plasma requires time and exists only in recovered patients. In our opinion, comprehensive and supportive treatments are essential in the early stage. Additionally, antiviral treatment in early stage and immune activation blockers such as IL-6 blockers, IL-1 blockers in late stage could be tried to control further disease progress leading to ARDS due to excessive immune activation.",
            "Targeted treatment should depend on individual differences due to various disease characteristics.",
            "COVID-19 were included. It would be better to include as many patients as possible to get a more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19. Second, more detailed patient information, particularly treatment strategies and clinical outcomes, was unavailable at the time of analysis. Regarding the inflammatory factors, we only measured IL-6 level changes. Future studies should focus on changes of various pro-inflammatory factors, ie IL-1, which may provide precise target treatment options for different patients.",
            "In conclusion, this study provides an early assessment of the clinical and laboratory profiles of COVID-19 patients in Hefei, China. The clinical manifestation of",
            "COVID-19 was nonspecific. Specific coronavirus antivirals show proven efficacies in humans are unavailable to date. Antiviral therapy requires a comprehensive and supportive treatment. Targeted therapy should also be determined based on individual clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators."
