        "abstract": "Introduction. While seasonal influenza and other respiratory pathogens cause significant morbidity and mortality each year, the community-based burden of these infections remains incompletely understood. Understanding the prevalence, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of respiratory pathogen infections among community-dwelling individuals is essential during pandemic and epidemic settings and for developing pandemic-preparedness infrastructure. \n\nMethods and Analysis. We present the protocol for a novel, city-wide home-based cross-sectional study in the Seattle Metropolitan area, utilizing rapid delivery systems for self-collection of a nasal swab and return to the laboratory for respiratory pathogen testing. All participation takes place electronically, including recruitment, consent, and data collection. Within 48 hours of participants self-reporting respiratory symptoms, a nasal swab kit is delivered to the household via a courier service. Demographic and illness characteristics are collected at the time of sample collection and recovery and behavioral information collected one week later. Specimens are tested in the laboratory for multiple respiratory pathogens, and results are available on a public website for participants. \n\nEthics and Dissemination. The study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (Protocol #00006181). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, talks at conferences, and on the Study Website (www.seattleflu.org).",

The study is nested within the Seattle Flu Study, a multi-armed influenza surveillance mechanism described, the protocol of which is described elsewhere[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].<br/><br/>Study population inclusion/exclusion criteria Individuals are eligible to participate in this study if they live within the Seattle Metropolitan area, experience a new or worsening cough and/or two ARI symptoms in the past seven days at time of enrollment (Table 1), are English-speaking, and have a valid email address and access to the internet at home. All individuals are consented to participate in the research study electronically. A parent or legally-authorized representative (LAR) will consent for individuals under 18 years, with assent for those between 7-18 years (Figure 1).<br/><br/>Individuals are excluded from participation if they are incarcerated, wards of the state, unable to comply with study procedures at the investigator\u2019s discretion, or previously enrolled in Swab & Send in the past seven days.",
            "Descriptive statistics of frequency/percentage and mean/standard deviation will be performed for categorical and continuous covariates, respectively. Bivariate analyses will be conducted using parametric and nonparametric tests as appropriate, with statistical significance defined as p<0.05.

        "Methods and Analysis": [
            "Study Design This is a prospective study of individuals residing within the Seattle Metropolitan area with ARI symptoms. The study is nested within the Seattle Flu Study, a multi-armed influenza surveillance mechanism described, the protocol of which is described elsewhere[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "Study population inclusion/exclusion criteria Individuals are eligible to participate in this study if they live within the Seattle Metropolitan area, experience a new or worsening cough and/or two ARI symptoms in the past seven days at time of enrollment (Table 1), are English-speaking, and have a valid email address and access to the internet at home. All individuals are consented to participate in the research study electronically. A parent or legally-authorized representative (LAR) will consent for individuals under 18 years, with assent for those between 7-18 years (Figure 1).",
            "Individuals are excluded from participation if they are incarcerated, wards of the state, unable to comply with study procedures at the investigator\u2019s discretion, or previously enrolled in Swab & Send in the past seven days.",
            "Recruitment, Screening, and Consent Recruitment of potential study participants is conducted using a combination of in-person referrals and internet advertisements, including: referral from a healthcare provider, travel clinic or immigrant/ refugee health screening, Seattle Flu Study community kiosk, school or place of work; printed flyers posted at community locations; and targeted online advertisements (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Google). Recruitment materials direct eligible participants to the study website (www.seattleflu.org, henceforth referenced as the \u201cStudy Website\u201d). Individuals screen themselves for eligibility on the study website by providing their age, home zip code, information about presence and duration of symptoms, and confirming home internet access. Individuals are informed about the study purpose, risks, and benefits, and sign an online form to provide consent to participate in the research. Numerous consent forms are available to accommodate the age range of participants (Figure 1).",
            "Expected Sample Size The study aims to enroll 3,000 participants over the course of the 2019-2020 season. We estimate 2,400 (80%) participants will return their nasal swab kit to the laboratory for respiratory pathogen testing and that 240 (10%) of specimens will be positive for influenza by molecular testing (Table 2).",
            "Outcomes Primary Outcomes: 1. Proportion of individuals who complete study procedures, including return of test kit and completion of questionnaire among those who test positive for respiratory pathogens",
            "2. Usability and feasibility of self-collected nasal swabs for diagnosis of respiratory pathogens in symptomatic individuals",
            "Secondary Outcomes: 1. Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of participants with respiratory pathogens who enrolled online through a home-based surveillance system and self-collected nasal swabs 2. Variation in symptom presence, duration and severity between individuals testing positive for different respiratory viruses 3. Behavioral and healthcare-seeking outcomes among individuals with and without respiratory pathogens detected, including healthcare utilization and work and school absenteeism",
            "Data Collection After consent, participants complete an online Enrollment Questionnaire,provide their home address and contact information such as an email address or phone number. Participants are mailed a swab kit within 48 hours of submitting the Enrollment Questionnaire, which includes a Quick Start Instruction Card, a UTM tube (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD), a nylon flocked swab (COPAN Diagnostics Inc., Murietta, CA), and a return box with affixed Category B UN3373 label, as required by International Air Transport Association (IATA) guidelines[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], and a pre-paid return shipping label. Pediatric nasal swabs are available for participants 5 years of age or younger.",
            "Upon kit receipt, participants complete an onlineIllness Questionnaire to ascertain demographics, illness characteristics, and health behaviors. At the end of the Illness Questionnaire, participants are prompted to self-collect a mid-nasal swab using the instructions provided on an instruction card included in the swab kit box.",
            "Participants are instructed to place their self-collected nasal swabs directly into the UTM tube which is pre-labeled with a unique barcode. Next, participants are instructed to place the UTM tube containing the self-collected nasal swab into a specimen bag, pre-packaged with an absorbent sheet, and then place the specimen bag into the provided return shipping box. United States Postal Service (USPS) return postage and Category B UN3373 stickers are affixed to the outside of the return box. Although previous testing has demonstrated that respiratory viral RNA is stable in room-temperature UTM for up to one week[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], participants are encouraged to mail their nasal swab as soon as possible. Returned samples are estimated to arrive at the laboratory approximately 24 hours after deposit at a US Postal Service facility.",
            "When kits are received in the study laboratory, contents of the box and errors in swab collection are recorded. Swabs are removed and viral transport media aliquoted, subjected to RNA amplification using a MagNA Pure 96 System, and tested for respiratory pathogens using TaqMan Open Array RT-PCR (Table 5)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. These methods are described in the Seattle Flu Study protocol[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "Seven days after the nasal swab collection, participants are re-contacted to complete a One Week Follow-Up Questionnaireto assess the impact of their illness on behavioral outcomes such as absenteeism and healthcare-seeking behaviors (provider visits, antiviral use, etc).",
            "Participants receive a $5 digital gift card for completing the Illness Questionnaireand returning their self-collected swab; an additional $5 gift card will be provided to participants who completed the One Week Follow-Up Questionnaire.Participants are able to view their test results for influenza A and B and RSV on the Study Websitewithin 3 months of when the swab is collected by entering their unique sample barcode.",
            "Data security and privacy Participant information is kept confidential, and questionnaire and sample data are linked to participants using a unique identification number assigned at enrollment; only the direct study team will have access to the linkage. All study questionnaires are collected through REDCap, which is Title 21 CFR Part 11 compliant[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Access to de-identified, aggregate study data and analysis code will be publicly available on the Study Website.",
            "Statistical Methods Descriptive statistics of frequency/percentage and mean/standard deviation will be performed for categorical and continuous covariates, respectively. Bivariate analyses will be conducted using parametric and nonparametric tests as appropriate, with statistical significance defined as p<0.05. Respiratory pathogen prevalence is defined as the total number of cases of a pathogen detected out of the total number of tested samples. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using negative binomial or Poisson regressions with robust standard errors.",
