        "abstract": "The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, at the end of 2019 has resulted in 3 widespread human infections across the globe. While genetically distinct from SARS4 CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome 5 (SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation 6 and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for 7 virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that 8 have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV 9 in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit. These cross-reactive mAbs may serve as tools useful for SARS-CoV-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease COVID-19.",

            "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent for the infectious disease, SARS, which first emerged 17 years ago [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. In<br/><br/>December of 2019, another novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) appeared to have crossed species barriers to infect humans and was effectively transmitted from person to person, leading to a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. As of 1 March 2020, this coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread further within China and worldwide to 60 countries with over 87,000 confirmed cases and 2,980 fatalities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. The outbreak has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health<br/><br/>Organization (WHO) and poses an increasing burden on global health and economy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].<br/><br/>A study of 56 complete and partial SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from COVID-19 patients showed very high sequence conservation of more than 99%, indicating a recent introduction of the virus into the human population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-<br/><br/>CoV-2 revealed that like SARS-CoV and bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-<br/><br/>CoVs), it belongs to lineage B of the betacoronavirus genus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. While SARS-CoV-2 shares higher whole-genome sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-<br/><br/>CoVZXC21 (88 \u2013 89%) than with SARS-CoV (79 \u2013 82%), the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV RBD, suggesting a possible common host cell receptor [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. In line with this, several groups have demonstrated that<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as SARS-CoV for viral entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Due to its role in virus entry, the viral surface spike (S) glycoprotein has been the target for the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The S protein is functionally divided into two domains with the RBD-containing<br/><br/>S1 subunit being responsible for attachment to host cell while the S2 subunit mediates fusion between viral and host membranes (reviewed by Li, F.) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not been established, SARS-CoV is believed to have originated from<br/><br/>SL-CoVs residing in bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. For the majority of SL-CoVs, the S1 subunit has low sequence homology to that of SARS-CoV which indicates species-dependent receptor binding [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. On the other hand, the high amino acid sequence identity of more than<br/><br/>90% in the S2 subunit suggests that the fusion mechanism during virus infection is wellconserved [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>].<br/><br/>In our previous work, we used an immunogenic fragment in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV to generate a panel of murine mAbs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. One of them, mAb 1A9, which binds to the S protein through a novel epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1111-1130, has the ability to bind and cross-neutralize pseudotyped viruses expressing S of human SARS-<br/><br/>CoV, civet SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV strains [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. In this study, we show that the sequence of the immunogen used to generate mAb 1A9, as well as three other mAbs, is conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2 and these mAbs bind to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, mAb 1A9 was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells."

        "methods": [
            "Cells<br/><br/>Vero E6 and COS-7 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone) and penicillin-streptomycin solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were maintained at \u00b0C with 5% CO2.<br/><br/>Purification of antibody<br/><br/>The hybridoma for mAb 1A9 was previously generated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. All mAbs were purified from cell culture supernatant using a HiTrap protein G HP affinity column (GE<br/><br/>Healthcare) and stored at -80 \u00b0C. The purity of the mAb was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) analysis. The concentration of the purified mAb was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific).<br/><br/>Transient transfection and western blot analysis<br/><br/>COS-7 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates 24 hours prior to the transient transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing plasmids were codon-optimized and generated by gene synthesis (Bio Basic Asia Pacific) according to GenBank accession QHD43416.1.<br/><br/>One plasmid is for expressing full-length S while the other is for expressing a fragment consisting of residues 1048-1206. At 48 hours post-transfection, cells were harvested, spun down by centrifugation and washed with cold PBS twice. Cells were then resuspended in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.5%<br/><br/>deoxycholic acid, 0.005% SDS and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] and subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles. Clarified supernatant containing the protein of interest was obtained by spinning down the cell lysate at 13,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C to remove the cell debris and further analyzed by Western blot (WB) analysis. 20 \u03bcg of total cell lysates were resolved using electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After the membrane was washed with TBST, it was incubated with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific) at room temperature for 1 hour. The membrane was then washed with TBST again and detected with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Scientific).<br/><br/>Transient transfection and immunofluorescence analysis<br/><br/>For immunofluorescence (IF) analysis, COS-7 cells on glass coverslips were transfected as above and fixed at 24 hours post-transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT) followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 5 min. Fixed cells were then blocked with PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min at RT. Cells were immunolabelled for 1 hour at RT with the indicated murine mAb and 45 min with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Life<br/><br/>Technologies). Immunolabelled coverslips were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma), and mounted using ProLong\u00ae Gold Antifade Mountant (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired with Olympus CKX53 microscope using Olympus LCAch N 20x/0.40<br/><br/>iPC objective lens and Olympus DP27 colour camera with Olympus cellSens software.<br/><br/>Each channel was collected separately, with images at 1024 x 1024 pixels.<br/><br/>Virus infection and IF<br/><br/>All works with live virus has been performed in the BSL3 facility at the Public Health<br/><br/>Agency of Sweden. Vero-E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-<br/><br/>Iso/01/human/2020/SWE, GenBank accession no. MT093571) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in DMEM 2% FBS (Thermo Fisher). At 24h post-infection, cells were fixed with chilled methanol/acetone and the cells were kept in -20\u00b0C overnight.<br/><br/>Cells were then stained using mAb 1A9 at 5\u03bcg/ml at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes in immunofluorescence buffer (BSA 0.2%, Triton X100 0.1% in PBS, pH 7.4). They were then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with goat anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa<br/><br/>Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Thermo Fisher) containing DAPI in immunofluorescence buffer for an additional incubation of 30 minutes. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS before reading in fluorescent microscopy.<br/><br/>Bioinformatics analysis<br/><br/>Spike glycoprotein reference protein sequences for SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, batRaTG13, MERS and human common cold coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and<br/><br/>HKU1 were downloaded from NCBI (GenBank accessions in alignment in Figure 1A). A multiple sequence alignment was created with MAFFT using the slow but accurate L-<br/><br/>INS-I parameter settings [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] and the alignment curated, cut to the target region 1029-<br/><br/>(SARS-CoV numbering) and visualized with Jalview [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. We used Mega X [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] to calculate the number of amino acid differences for all sequence pairs in the alignment of the mAb target region (Figure 1B) and the full S protein (Figure 1C) normalized by the length of the aligned sequence of the respective reference protein to obtain percent amino acid identities.<br/><br/>To determine within-outbreak sequence diversity in the spike glycoprotein, 230 human and environmental outbreak virus sequences were downloaded from the GISAID database on March 1st 2020. We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the sequences from GISAID\u2019s EpiCoVTM Database on which this part of the research is based. The list is detailed in Supplementary Table 1.
