            "The study provides a deterministic mathematical model to analyse and predict characteristics of an infectious disease spreading in an extremely large population with strong prevention and control measures. The model depends purely on statistic data of categorised epidemic cases reported in public. We apply the model to the emergence of COVID-19 in China. Although the model is not yet perfect, it is effective, robust and consistent as long as there is no sudden change in control measures. Comparing with the classic SIR model, we extract the basic reproduction number, R0, and make predictions on the time when the effective reproduction number will become less than one and on the total number of confirmed cases in the end. Our study indicates that it is essential to take effective control measures as early as possible for curbing an infectious disease and it is important to report epidemic data precisely and timely for epidemiological modelling. In the era of globalisation, an infectious disease can spread as far as any individual can reach on the earth, that makes the whole world population to be susceptible. As COVID-19 has spread around the world, we anticipate our method can be adapted in modelling the spread and help public health authorities make policy decisions."

            "We consider a mathematical model purely based on categorised reported cases, because we believe that key epidemic features will be convolved in the evolution of an infectious disease, namely, the statistics of epidemic data. Should such a model can be fitted with data reasonably well, some epidemic parameters can be extracted. Let\u2019s take the number of cumulative confirmed cases (A), the number of cumulative recovered cases (C) and the number of cumulative deaths (D). We define the number of cumulative removed cases (R) as R = C + D, and the number of current infectives (I) as I = A \u2212 R. We assume change rates of both I and R are proportional to I (justification of this assumption will been discussed later), dI",

            "where T2 is a transition time of R, and Ro = R(t = 0), being a constant. Ro is related to Io by Ro = \u03b3Io/\u03c11. But in principle, both Io and Ro are just arbitrary constants because we choose time zero randomly.",
            "We use (3) and (4) to fit epidemic curves. For various reasons, reported numbers of cumulative confirmed cases in Hubei are comparatively less reliable. Particularly, there is a jump on February 12, seeing Figure 1 and Table 1, due to the addition of clinically diagnosed cases (only applicable to Hubei province) to previously laboratory confirmed cases. On the other hand, numbers of cumulative confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths of other provinces on the Chinese mainland are quite reliable since January 20 when the National Health Commission started to daily report the epidemic situation. Therefore, we apply the model to the epidemic data excluding Hubei.",
            "We fit, in Figure 1, the curve of current infectives (I) with (3) and the curve of cumulative removed cases (R) with (4) simultaneously. During the fitting procedure, the parameters \u03c11 and \u03c12 are shared, and others are free to vary. The fit method is minimisation of a chi-square (\u03c72) using data errors. The data errors are estimated on the base of single counting uncertainty. Let Ai, Ci and Di separately stand for cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative recoveries and cumulative deaths reported as \u221aof i-th day. By definition, Ii = Ai \u2212\u221aCi \u2212 Di and Ri = Ci + Di, we have Ai + Ci + Di for the error of Ii and Ci + Di for the error of Ri, respectively. Fitting results are shown in Figure 2 and summarised in Table 2. The covariance matrix and the correlation matrix of fit parameters are also reported in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. The 95% confidence intervals have been calculated for I, R as well as A, also shown in Figure 2.",
            "The spreading trend of COVID-19 on the Chinese mainland (excluding Hubei) could be predicted with the model. With the fitting results, the number of current infectives would be less than one after April 2 with 95% confidence level (CL)1, that can be regarded as the ending of the disease. Meanwhile, the total number of confirmed cases would approach 14408\u00b1429. In addition, we see the current infectives peaks around February 11. Should we perform the same analysis on data before the peaking date, we could obtain similar results, but with comparatively larger uncertainties, as shown in Figure 3, confirming the predictability of the method.",

The model is adequate for limited population and freely developed infectious diseases. For COVID-19 in China, the static SIR model is incapable. On one hand, the extremely tight prevention and control measures have taken effect significantly, hence suppressing the contact rate",
            "with time; on the other hand, the population in China is more than 1.4 billion and modern transportation methods, e.g., high speed trains, have brought all people in the country as a whole being susceptible, eliminating the depletion effect of susceptibles. The latter causes S \u2248 N can be regarded as being infinite, or a constant. Consequently the equations in (5) reduce to our model in (1) with \u03c1 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3.",
            "Before the transition time T1, \u03c11 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3, being a constant, justifying our previous assumption for the model. To estimate \u03b3, we cannot use Io and Ro directly because the time zero, t = 0, in our analysis is arbitrarily chosen and the two constants are subject to large fluctuation. Instead, we can take the epidemic meaning of 1/\u03b3 and interpret its equivalence to the transition time difference between R and I, namely, 1/\u03b3 = T2 \u2212 T1.",
            "with our fitting results, R0 = 2.82 \u00b1 0.11 (95% CL). To quantify the impact of control measures, however, we should use the effective reproduction number, Rt . The spreading of an epidemic will stop when Rt become less than 1 persistently. With respect to the time dependent contact rate, \u03b2(t), using (6), we have the effective reproduction number \u03b2(t)",
            "where \u03c1(t) is in (2). The distribution of Rt with our fitting results is shown in Figure 4. It starts with R0, and approaches zero logarithmically. The time when Rt = 1 will be between March 19 and March 21 (95% CL).",
            "The stability and consistency of our model can be verified by fitting the previous epidemic data day-by-day up to now. The repetitious fit starts with data as of February 5 in order to have enough statistics. For each fit, we extract R0 and the date, TR1, with Rt = 1. Results are depicted in Figure 5. We see fluctuation in daily results of R0 and TR1, but both of them are consistent within 95% confidence intervals during the epidemic so far."

We assume change rates of both I and R are proportional to I (justification of this assumption will been discussed later), dI",

            "\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 ln T1 if t > T1, where T1 is a transition time when the rate changes from a constant to a time dependent variable due to disease control measures taking effect, and both \u03c11 and \u03c12 are constants. Then, we have",
            "where Io = I(t = 0) is a constant. Considering the existence of an infectious period, the transition time of R(t) will be different from that of I(t). Therefore, R(t) can be expressed as",
            "where T2 is a transition time of R, and Ro = R(t = 0), being a constant. Ro is related to Io by Ro = \u03b3Io/\u03c11. But in principle, both Io and Ro are just arbitrary constants because we choose time zero randomly.",
            "We use (3) and (4) to fit epidemic curves. For various reasons, reported numbers of cumulative confirmed cases in Hubei are comparatively less reliable. Particularly, there is a jump on February 12, seeing Figure 1 and Table 1, due to the addition of clinically diagnosed cases (only applicable to Hubei province) to previously laboratory confirmed cases. On the other hand, numbers of cumulative confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths of other provinces on the Chinese mainland are quite reliable since January 20 when the National Health Commission started to daily report the epidemic situation. Therefore, we apply the model to the epidemic data excluding Hubei.",
            "We fit, in Figure 1, the curve of current infectives (I) with (3) and the curve of cumulative removed cases (R) with (4) simultaneously. During the fitting procedure, the parameters \u03c11 and \u03c12 are shared, and others are free to vary. The fit method is minimisation of a chi-square (\u03c72) using data errors. The data errors are estimated on the base of single counting uncertainty. Let Ai, Ci and Di separately stand for cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative recoveries and cumulative deaths reported as \u221aof i-th day. By definition, Ii = Ai \u2212\u221aCi \u2212 Di and Ri = Ci + Di, we have Ai + Ci + Di for the error of Ii and Ci + Di for the error of Ri, respectively. Fitting results are shown in Figure 2 and summarised in Table 2. The covariance matrix and the correlation matrix of fit parameters are also reported in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. The 95% confidence intervals have been calculated for I, R as well as A, also shown in Figure 2.",
            "The spreading trend of COVID-19 on the Chinese mainland (excluding Hubei) could be predicted with the model. With the fitting results, the number of current infectives would be less than one after April 2 with 95% confidence level (CL)1, that can be regarded as the ending of the disease. Meanwhile, the total number of confirmed cases would approach 14408\u00b1429. In addition, we see the current infectives peaks around February 11. Should we perform the same analysis on data before the peaking date, we could obtain similar results, but with comparatively larger uncertainties, as shown in Figure 3, confirming the predictability of the method.",

On one hand, the extremely tight prevention and control measures have taken effect significantly, hence suppressing the contact rate",

To estimate \u03b3, we cannot use Io and Ro directly because the time zero, t = 0, in our analysis is arbitrarily chosen and the two constants are subject to large fluctuation. Instead, we can take the epidemic meaning of 1/\u03b3 and interpret its equivalence to the transition time difference between R and I, namely, 1/\u03b3 = T2 \u2212 T1.",
            "with our fitting results, R0 = 2.82 \u00b1 0.11 (95% CL). To quantify the impact of control measures, however, we should use the effective reproduction number, Rt . The spreading of an epidemic will stop when Rt become less than 1 persistently. With respect to the time dependent contact rate, \u03b2(t), using (6), we have the effective reproduction number \u03b2(t)",

            "The stability and consistency of our model can be verified by fitting the previous epidemic data day-by-day up to now. The repetitious fit starts with data as of February 5 in order to have enough statistics. For each fit, we extract R0 and the date, TR1, with Rt = 1. Results are depicted in Figure 5. We see fluctuation in daily results of R0 and TR1, but both of them are consistent within 95% confidence intervals during the epidemic so far."

        "Discussion": [
            "The study provides a deterministic mathematical model to analyse and predict characteristics of an infectious disease spreading in an extremely large population with strong prevention and control measures. The model depends purely on statistic data of categorised epidemic cases reported in public. We apply the model to the emergence of COVID-19 in China. Although the model is not yet perfect, it is effective, robust and consistent as long as there is no sudden change in control measures. Comparing with the classic SIR model, we extract the basic reproduction number, R0, and make predictions on the time when the effective reproduction number will become less than one and on the total number of confirmed cases in the end. Our study indicates that it is essential to take effective control measures as early as possible for curbing an infectious disease and it is important to report epidemic data precisely and timely for epidemiological modelling. In the era of globalisation, an infectious disease can spread as far as any individual can reach on the earth, that makes the whole world population to be susceptible. As COVID-19 has spread around the world, we anticipate our method can be adapted in modelling the spread and help public health authorities make policy decisions."
