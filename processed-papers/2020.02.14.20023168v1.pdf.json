In early stage of the disease, patients\u2019 number would double every 7.4 days. Basic reproduction number (R0) was presumed to be 2.2 (95% CI 1.4-3.9). In Qun\u2019s paper R0\u2019s 95% CI was between 1.4-3.9. R0=2, 3 or 4 were used in model preparation. And 2 and 4 were ruled out because of obvious devotion from open reported data. So R0 was set at 3 in this simulation. Patient incubation time after been transmitted was assigned by python numpy random.normal function, with parameters set as: loc ( mean value of random serie )=7.5, scale ( standard deviation) = 3.4. Values lower than 0 are converted to positive values. In this study, simulation cases can only transmit virus to new patients on the last day of incubation to make calculation simple. According to media report and Wuhan government\u2019s announcement, the 2019-nCOV epidemic could be divided into 3 periods.

            "4 unknown pneumonia patients were spotted by 29th December 2019 in Wuhan China. all patients had history related to Huanan Seafood Market. Similar cases kept emerging. Qun Li et al collected 435 cases by the middle of January 2020[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Average incubation time assumed to be 7.5 \u00b1 3.4 days (95% CI 5.3-19.0). In the early stage of disease, patients number would be doubled every 7. 4days.R0 was calculated to be 2.2 ( 95% CI 1.4-3.9). National Health Commission issued an order to treat 2019-ConV as a category B infectious disease, controlled as category A (same policy as SARS). On the day of 23 January 2020, Wuhan municipal government decided to lock down the city. All public transportation except emergence services between this giant south China city and the rest of China were stopped. In-city public transportation services were also on held. China started to mobilize enormous medical resources include healthcare teams to help Wuhan. Under multiple measures meant to contaminate this novel virus, diagnosed and suspected cases kept increasing. Among the infected patients, 5% or more were in critical condition and were located in intensive care units. When could the public see ending of this epidemic become a common concern. We used computer model simulation to show effects of different level of efforts in containing this virus from spreading. To make things simple, restrictions of patients\u2019 activities (including in-hospital treatment, cabin hospital stay, and in-house surveillance) were represented as personal activity index PAI.<br/><br/>Read, Jonathan\u2019s preprint work showed a R0 to be 3.6-4.0[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. In our simulation study, data show simulated patients to be 2868.7\u00b11739.0 by the end of period 1 (day50). Data from China Disease Control and Prevention Center shows cumulated patients number was 31728 , daily new patients number was 3911 by 10th February, 2020 (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/). This information confines within simulated data of our model if we set PAI of period 2 to be 0.9. When it came to end of period 2, simulated patients\u2019 number had reached 52185.4\u00b131621.4. We can deduce that city lock-down did not work as supposed.<br/><br/>Till 11th February 2020, more than 154 medical teams, 18700 healthcare personels were sent to Wuhan. A whole population body temperature monitoring program was also undertaken to identify fever patients. And local CDC announced to stop using time consuming RNA test as common diagnosis standard. Local residencies were locked down to minimize inter people transmission.<br/><br/>How these measures would affect disease spreading is still not knowing. So we simulated the effects by set PAI from 0.9 to 0. PAI = 0.9 means no change in current people behavior while PAI = 0 means total grounded (include hospital stay and in-house surveillance).<br/><br/>With simulated data, we found that: Wuhan have 81700 hospital beds in nearly 300 hospitals among which 61 top tier hospitals in a government report (http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/upload/file/20191205/1575536693972018707.pdf). In free transmission stage, cumulated patients number reached 52185.4\u00b131621.4 on day 70.<br/><br/>Critical care rate is 5% according to Zhong\u2019s preprint manuscript [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. So more than 2600 patients needed intensive care. This huge infectious patient number would stop all Wuhan<br/><br/>ICUs from proper function.<br/><br/>At the beginning of stage 3, different PAI were used to calculate future trends in disease epidemic. We found that new daily patients number seem to stay in plateau when PAI =0.3. When PAI reduced to 0.2, a decline in daily new patient could be seen. If PAI could be restricted to 0.1, an ideal state of zero new daily patient would show up at the end of period 3."

            "1. COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. It can cause strong inter people transmission.

Among the infected patients, 5% or more were in critical condition and were located in intensive care units. When could the public see ending of this epidemic become a common concern. We used computer model simulation to show effects of different level of efforts in containing this virus from spreading. To make things simple, restrictions of patients\u2019 activities (including in-hospital treatment, cabin hospital stay, and in-house surveillance) were represented as personal activity index PAI.",
            "Read, Jonathan\u2019s preprint work showed a R0 to be 3.6-4.0[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. In our simulation study, data show simulated patients to be 2868.7\u00b11739.0 by the end of period 1 (day50). Data from China Disease Control and Prevention Center shows cumulated patients number was 31728 , daily new patients number was 3911 by 10th February, 2020 (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/). This information confines within simulated data of our model if we set PAI of period 2 to be 0.9. When it came to end of period 2, simulated patients\u2019 number had reached 52185.4\u00b131621.4. We can deduce that city lock-down did not work as supposed.",
            "Till 11th February 2020, more than 154 medical teams, 18700 healthcare personels were sent to Wuhan. A whole population body temperature monitoring program was also undertaken to identify fever patients. And local CDC announced to stop using time consuming RNA test as common diagnosis standard. Local residencies were locked down to minimize inter people transmission.",
            "How these measures would affect disease spreading is still not knowing. So we simulated the effects by set PAI from 0.9 to 0. PAI = 0.9 means no change in current people behavior while PAI = 0 means total grounded (include hospital stay and in-house surveillance).",
            "With simulated data, we found that: Wuhan have 81700 hospital beds in nearly 300 hospitals among which 61 top tier hospitals in a government report (http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/upload/file/20191205/1575536693972018707.pdf). In free transmission stage, cumulated patients number reached 52185.4\u00b131621.4 on day 70.",
            "Critical care rate is 5% according to Zhong\u2019s preprint manuscript [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. So more than 2600 patients needed intensive care. This huge infectious patient number would stop all Wuhan",
            "ICUs from proper function.",
            "At the beginning of stage 3, different PAI were used to calculate future trends in disease epidemic. We found that new daily patients number seem to stay in plateau when PAI =0.3. When PAI reduced to 0.2, a decline in daily new patient could be seen. If PAI could be restricted to 0.1, an ideal state of zero new daily patient would show up at the end of period 3."

        "Conclusion": [
            "1. COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. It can cause strong inter people transmission. Enormous difficulties could be anticipated if not contained in early stage.",
            "2. 5% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements.",
            "3. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. And long-term effect relates to how well Wuhan fulfill this task.",
            "4. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease.",
            "A respiratory disease spreading involves numerous factors. This simulation model uses only arbitrary data to make the calculation. And also, parameters are simplified to make the calculation faster, the results may be varying from real data. The model should be modified using actual data in order to get more accurate results.",
