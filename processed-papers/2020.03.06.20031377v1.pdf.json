Our analysis indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation existed between serum D-Dimer level and the duration of antiviral treatment, while lymphocyte concentration significantly positively correlated with the duration of virus reversal. Introduction Since Dec 8th 2019, many cases has been reported by investigators who described the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection1-3. We noticed the recent report4 from Lan et al. that 4 medical staff were still virus carriers after recovery from COVID-19 infection. Here we gave a report on 25 discharged patients with their medical record review and further analysis. Methods All these 25 patients with COVID-19 infection were once hospitalized from Jan 23th 2020 to Feb 21th 2020. They all met the following criteria of hospital discharge in China: [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] more than 3 days of normal; [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] significant reduction of respiratory symptoms; [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] substantial improvement over conventional chest radiography detection; [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] consecutively twice negative results of RT-PCR testing with an interval for at least 1 day. Considering the risk of reinfection, they were all self-segregating at home for further observation. Real-time RT-PCR detection were performed as described previously5. Other demographic, clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings were extracted from the electronic medical records of the patients. The study was approved by Shenzhen Third People\u2019s Hospital Ethics Committee and the informed consent was waived. Results 25 discharged patients with COVID-19 infection were back hospitalized because of the virus mRNA recurrence. The median age of these 17 females and 8 males was 28 years (16.25~42), including 6 children under 12 years old. 21 of them had no comorbidity and 22 patients had the history of residing in Hubei province.
