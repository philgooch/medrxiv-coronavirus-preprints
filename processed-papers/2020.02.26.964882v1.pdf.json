        "abstract": "A coronavirus identified as 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is the etiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening, and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key coronavirus enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Seven of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.48 to 16.62 \u03bcM. Ebselen, thiadiazolidinone-8 (TDZD-8) and N3 also exhibited strong antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, and establishes a new paradigm for the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.",

            "In the last twenty years, new infectious agents have emerged to cause epidemics, such as<br/><br/>SARS and MERS11. The timely development of effective antiviral agents for clinical use is extremely challenging because conventional drug development approaches normally take years of investigations and cost billions of dollars pharmaceutical drugs and drug candidates provides an alternative approach to rapidly identify potential drug leads to manage rapidly emerging viral infections[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Cell-based phenotypic screening has proven to be valuable[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>], but the corresponding methodological complexity is not readily compatible with high-throughput pipelines, and fails to inform the identity of the molecular target or mechanism of action[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. In this regard, we combined structure-based ab initio drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening to discover new drugs for treating COVID-19 infection. The convergence of these three approaches proved to be an efficient strategy in finding three lead compounds with good antiviral activity. Ebselen is of particular interest for further investigation since its safety in humans has been supported by different clinical trials[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Our methodology establishes a paradigm of rapid discovering drug leads with clinical potential in response to new emerging infectious diseases lacking specific drugs and vaccines.<br/><br/>. The repurposing of approved<br/><br/>The crystal structural and docking data have shown that these drug leads can bind to the substrate-binding pocket of COVID-19 Mpro. In our previous study, we proposed that all the CoV Mpros share a highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket, which serves as a drug target for broad-spectrum inhibitor design[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Recent discovery of new CoVs and accumulation of structural data for CoV Mpros from various species provided the opportunity to further examine our previous hypothesis. Superposition of the 12 crystal structures of Mpros[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>] have shown that the most variable regions were the helical domain III and surface loops, but the substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between domains I and II are still highly conserved among all CoV Mpros, suggesting the antiviral inhibitors targeting at this site should have wide-spectrum anti-CoV activity (Fig. 4). This strongly supports our hypothesis that development of a single antiviral agent could provide an effective first line of defense against all CoV-associated diseases."

            "Cloning, protein expression and purification<br/><br/>The full-length gene encoding COVID-19 Mpro was optimized and synthesized for<br/><br/>Escherichia coli expression (GENEWIZ). Cloning strategy for producing authentic viral<br/><br/>Mpro has been reported previously[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. The expression plasmid was transformed into<br/><br/>Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and then cultured in Luria broth (LB) media containing \u03bcg/mL ampicillin at 37\u00b0C, 220 rpm. When the cells were grown to OD600 of 0.6-0.8, 0.5 mM IPTG was added to the cell culture to induce the expression of the recombinant<br/><br/>COVID-19 Mpro at 16\u00b0C, 180 rpm. After 10 hours, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000\u00d7g for 20 min.<br/><br/>The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl), lysed by high-pressure homogenization, and then centrifuged at 25,000\u00d7g for 40 min. The supernatant was loaded onto Ni-NTA affinity column (QIAGEN), and washed by the resuspension buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. The His tagged Mpro was eluted by cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl) including 300 mM imidazole.<br/><br/>Human rhinovirus 3C protease was added to remove the C-terminal His tag. The COVID-<br/><br/>Mpro was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare). The purified COVID-19 Mpro was stored in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mM EDTA.    Crystallization<br/><br/>COVID-19 Mpro was incubated with 10 mM N3 for 30 min and the complex (5 mg/ml) was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20\u00b0C. The best crystals were grown with well buffer containing 2% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, 3% DMSO, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0). The cryo-protectant solution contained 30% PEG 400, 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0).<br/><br/>Data collection and structure determination<br/><br/>X-ray data were collected on beamline BL17U1 at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation<br/><br/>Facility (SSRF) at 100 K and at a wavelength of 1.07180 \u00c5 using an Eiger X 16M image plate detector. Data integration and scaling were performed using the program Xia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The structure was determined by molecular replacement (MR) with the Phaser module[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] in<br/><br/>CCP437 using the SARS-CoV Mpro (PDB ID: 2H2Z) as a search template. The output model from MR was subsequently subjected to iterative cycles of manual model adjustment with<br/><br/>Coot[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] and refinement was finished with Phenix[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. The inhibitor N3 was built according to the omit map. The phasing and refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data<br/><br/>Coordinates and structure factors for COVID-19 Mpro in complex with the inhibitor N3 have been deposited in Protein Data Bank with accession number 6LU7.<br/><br/>Enzymatic activity and inhibition assays<br/><br/>The enzyme activity assays have been described previously[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Briefly, the activity of<br/><br/>COVID-19 Mpro was measured by continuous kinetic assay, with the substrate MCA-<br/><br/>AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2 (GL Biochem Shanghai Ltd), using wavelengths of 320 and 405 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The assays started by immediately mixing 0.2 \u03bcM COVID-19 Mpro with different concentrations of substrate (2.5-100 \u03bcM).<br/><br/>Fluorescence intensity was monitored with EnVision multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer). Initial rates were obtained by fitting the linear portion of the curves (usually the first 3 min of the assay curves) to a straight line. The kinetic parameters Km and kcat were calculated from a double-reciprocal plot. As N3 is a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor for COVID-19 Mpro, kobs/[I] was used as an approximation of the pseudo secondorder rate constant to evaluate the inhibition effect of the inhibitor N315. In this case, the measurement was carried out with 0.2 \u03bcM of enzyme, 20 \u03bcM of substrate and inhibitor at different concentrations (0-1 \u03bcM).<br/><br/>The virtual screening was performed using our in-house database via a workflow application of Glide (v8.2)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>], which is a module of molecular simulation software package, Maestro (Schrodinger 2019-1a). All compounds in the database were considered to be at pH 7.4 \u00b1 0.2 to estimate their protonation state using the program EpiK41. Their three dimensional conformations were generated by the ligPrep module of Maestro. The newly obtained complex structure of COVID-19 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) was used to generate receptor grid for docking simulations. The center of active site of the grid was determined according to the N3 in the structure. The flexibility of the receptor hydroxyl and thiol groups in side chains of C145, S46 and Y54 were considered. At the very beginning, a relatively fast but raw screening was performed by using the glide standard precision model, and the top 20% of compounds were kept. Then covalent docking simulations were performed by choosing Michael Addition as the reaction type for these top 20% compounds that contained Michael acceptors, and C145 was set as the source of Michael donor. Finally, the candidate molecules were picked out by analysing the predicted binding modes and their scores.<br/><br/>High-throughput drug screen and IC50 measurement<br/><br/>Potential inhibitors against COVID-19 Mpro were screened by enzymatic inhibition assay.<br/><br/>When different compounds were added into the enzymatic reaction, the change of initial rates was calculated to evaluate their inhibitory effect. Five drug libraries, Approved Drug<br/><br/>Library (TargetMol, USA), Clinic Compound Library (TargetMol, USA), FDA-approved<br/><br/>Drug Library (Selleck, USA), Natural Product Library (Selleck, USA), and Anti-virus drug library (Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies, SIAIS), which includes<br/><br/>~ 10,000 compounds, were used. The preliminary screening reaction mixture included 0.2<br/><br/>\u03bcM protein, 20 \u03bcM substrate and 50 \u03bcM compounds. The compounds of interest were defined as those with a percentage of inhibition over 60% compared with the reaction in the absence of inhibitor. IC50 values were measured at 12 concentrations and three independent experiments were performed. All experimental data was analyzed using<br/><br/>GraphPad Prism software.<br/><br/>Molecular docking<br/><br/>To understand the binding interaction of these molecules with COVID-19 Mpro, two different molecular docking methods, i.e., Glide (v8.2)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>] and iFitDock[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>] were used to predict their binding poses. Then a 3D molecular similarity calculation method, SHAFTs43, was used for molecular alignment poses enumeration by matching the critical pharmacophore and volumetric overlay between the N3 molecule within the Mpro structure and the seven drug candidates. However, the selenium atom of ebselen could not be treated by any of these above methods, so sulfur was used to replace it in the calculations. Then the obtained optimal superposition of these molecules were used to assist the reasonability of the predicted binding poses from the two docking methods, and only the binding orientations which were consistent among different methods were kept for constructing the initial complexes. Finally, these complexes were further optimized (refined binding poses are illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 4) and re-scored (shown in Extended Data Table 2) by using MM-GBSA module[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] of Schr\u00f6dinger, and the residues within 5 \u00c5 around the ligand were refined.<br/><br/>Antiviral assay for compounds identified from high-throughput screening<br/><br/>Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in Dulbecco\u2019s modified<br/><br/>Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin.<br/><br/>The COVID-19 was originally isolated from a throat swab specimen from a pneumonia patient and amplified in Vero cells.

            "In the last twenty years, new infectious agents have emerged to cause epidemics, such as",
            "SARS and MERS11. The timely development of effective antiviral agents for clinical use is extremely challenging because conventional drug development approaches normally take years of investigations and cost billions of dollars pharmaceutical drugs and drug candidates provides an alternative approach to rapidly identify potential drug leads to manage rapidly emerging viral infections[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Cell-based phenotypic screening has proven to be valuable[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>], but the corresponding methodological complexity is not readily compatible with high-throughput pipelines, and fails to inform the identity of the molecular target or mechanism of action[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. In this regard, we combined structure-based ab initio drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening to discover new drugs for treating COVID-19 infection. The convergence of these three approaches proved to be an efficient strategy in finding three lead compounds with good antiviral activity. Ebselen is of particular interest for further investigation since its safety in humans has been supported by different clinical trials[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Our methodology establishes a paradigm of rapid discovering drug leads with clinical potential in response to new emerging infectious diseases lacking specific drugs and vaccines.",
            "The crystal structural and docking data have shown that these drug leads can bind to the substrate-binding pocket of COVID-19 Mpro. In our previous study, we proposed that all the CoV Mpros share a highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket, which serves as a drug target for broad-spectrum inhibitor design[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Recent discovery of new CoVs and accumulation of structural data for CoV Mpros from various species provided the opportunity to further examine our previous hypothesis. Superposition of the 12 crystal structures of Mpros[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>] have shown that the most variable regions were the helical domain III and surface loops, but the substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between domains I and II are still highly conserved among all CoV Mpros, suggesting the antiviral inhibitors targeting at this site should have wide-spectrum anti-CoV activity (Fig. 4). This strongly supports our hypothesis that development of a single antiviral agent could provide an effective first line of defense against all CoV-associated diseases."

            "This strongly supports the hypothesis that development of a single antiviral agent could provide an effective first line of defense against all CoV-associated diseases"
