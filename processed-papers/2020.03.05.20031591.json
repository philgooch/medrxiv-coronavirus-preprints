        "abstract": "Background: Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them.\nMethods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. \nResults: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged &gt;[60] years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p&lt;0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.\nConclusions: Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients. Elevated CRP levels, underlying comorbidities, and NCP severity are the main risk factors for cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients.",

Cardiac markers of 23 (43.39%) patients were within the normal range (4 [17.39%] aged >60 years; median age, 40.00 years [IQR 23.00, 51.00]). There were no significant gender differences among the three subgroups. Epidemiology of all the groups was similar (all p>0.05), such as being a local resident, Wuhan residence exposure, and COVID-19 exposure. No patients had direct Huanan seafood market exposure. No exact epidemiological link was found between the first case and the later ones. Almost all the patients\u2019 first onset symptoms were fever (n=47, 88.68%) and dry cough (n=41, 77.36%).

Cardiac markers of 23 (43.39%) patients were within the normal range (4 [17.39%] aged >60 years; median age, 40.00 years [IQR 23.00, 51.00]). There were no significant gender differences among the three subgroups. Epidemiology of all the groups was similar (all p>0.05), such as being a local resident, Wuhan residence exposure, and COVID-19 exposure. No patients had direct Huanan seafood market exposure. No exact epidemiological link was found between the first case and the later ones. Almost all the patients\u2019 first onset symptoms were fever (n=47, 88.68%) and dry cough (n=41, 77.36%). Furthermore, the mean systolic blood pressure of the AMI patients was higher than those of the other two groups (p<0.001). Fifteen (28%) of all the patients had tachycardia. High occurrence of hypertension was detected in the AMI patients (total patients with hypertension: n=8, 15.09%; AMI group: n=4, 66.67%; cardiac marker abnormalities group: n=2, 8.33%; without cardiac marker abnormalities group: n=2, 8.69%; p=0.001). Cardiovascular diseases were more frequently found in the AMI patients, all of whom had coronary artery disease, with one having prior coronary artery bypass grafting (total patients with cardiovascular disease: n=6, 11.32%; AMI group: n=4, 66.67%), compared with the groups with and without cardiac marker abnormalities (p=0.001). Additionally, diabetes (n=8, 15.09%) and COPD (n=3, 5.6%) were found in all the patients, with a higher tendency in the AMI group (diabetes: n=2 and COPD: n=2) than in the other two groups (Figure 1). Notably, only the AMI patients had more than two comorbidities (n=5). Regarding CT or DR findings on admission, all the AMI patients and 21 (87.5%) non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities had bilateral multilobular and sub-segmental lung involvement; in the without cardiac marker abnormalities group, bilateral lobes were affected in only 15 (65.22%) patients.",
            "Laboratory tests The laboratory test and blood gas analysis results are shown in Table S1 (see in supplementary appendix). CRP levels of all the AMI patients were increased above the normal range (0\u20135 mg/l) on admission and were higher than those of the other two groups; however, CRP levels were also increased in some patients in the groups with (n=9, 39.13%; CRP: median, 14.70 mg/ml [IQR 9.51, 24.53]) and without (n=4, 16.67%; CRP: median, 5.36 mg/ml [IQR 1.27,9.16]) cardiac marker abnormalities. D-dimer levels on admission were increased in the AMI patients (median, 1.65 \u03bcg/ml [IQR 1.23, 4.48]) and patients with abnormal cardiac markers (median, 0.79 \u03bcg/ml [IQR 0.62, 0.93]) and were higher than those in patients with normal cardiac markers (median, 0.55 \u03bcg/ml [IQR 0.46, 0.72]; p<0.001). Initial white blood cell counts of all the patients were within the normal range (3.50\u20139.50 \u00d7 109/l). Initial lymphocyte counts of five (83.33%) AMI patients were decreased below the normal range (0.80\u20134.00 \u00d7 109/l); these counts were decreased in only nine (37.5%) and eight (34.78%) patients with and without cardiac marker abnormalities, respectively. Furthermore, red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count of the AMI group were lower than those of the other two groups (p<0.05); four (66.67%) AMI patients had procalcitonin levels above the normal range (0\u20130.5 ng/ml).",
            "Cardiac marker, echo, and ECG abnormalities Over half (n=30, 56.6%) of the COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated cardiac marker levels. Cardiac marker levels were higher in the AMI and non-definite AMI patients than in those without cardiac marker abnormities (p<0.05; Figure S1 in supplementary appendix). In the AMI group, cardiac marker levels continuously increased in three patients who died, with the levels being extremely high on the day of death (Figure S2 in supplementary appendix). Meanwhile, there were some differences in echo and ECG findings (Table 2). Of all the COVID-19 patients, 45.28% (n=24) patients exhibited echo abnormalities. Echo abnormalities more frequently occurred in the AMI group and included left atrial enlargement (n=2), left ventricular (LV) enlargement (n=2), LV diastolic dysfunction (n=3), mitral valve regurgitation (n=2), triple valve regurgitation (n=1), and aortic valve regurgitation (n=1). Three AMI patients had LV wall thickening. It is noteworthy that non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities also had high frequency of echo abnormalities (n=15, 62.50%), with 11(45.83%) of them having more than two of the abovementioned echo abnormalities. The most frequent echo abnormality in the cardiac marker abnormalities group was LV diastolic dysfunction (n=14, 58.33%). As shown in Table 3, 11 (20.75%) COIVD-19 patients had ECG abnormalities, including all the AMI patients and five (20.83%) non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. Five of the AMI patients had more than two kinds of ECG abnormalities including atrioventricular block (n=2), ST-T/Q curve abnormalities (n=2), and arrhythmia (n=3); furthermore, ST-T/Q curve abnormalities (n=5, 20.83%) and arrhythmia (n=1, 4.27%) were the main abnormalities in patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. None of the patients without cardiac marker abnormalities exhibited ECG abnormalities.",
            "Table 3 shows the main management strategies, comorbid conditions, and clinical outcomes of all the COVID-19 patients. In the AMI group, in addition to antiviral and antibiotic therapies, cardioprotective medications such as amiodarone and cedilla were used by four patients to improve the cardiac function. However, the non-definite AMI patients with and without cardiac markers abnormalities did not use cardioprotective medication. All the 53 patients were administered nasal cannula oxygen therapy during admission for respiratory support; non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was performed for five AMI and three non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. Notably, in the AMI group, invasive mechanical ventilation was used in three patients and ECMO in one patient due to extremely severe ARDS. ARDS occurred in all the six AMI patients and four non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. Hypoxemia was a common complication that affected 19 (35.85%) of the 53 study patients, with a significant difference in the number of affected patients between the AMI (n=6, 100%) and non-definite AMI with cardiac marker abnormalities (n=10, 41.67%) groups and the without cardiac marker abnormalities group (n=3, 13.04%; p<0.001). Moreover, a total of five AMI patients had AKI, and four of them used continuous renal replacement therapy. Importantly, all the six AMI patients had critically severe NCP and needed care in intensive care unit (ICU). However, half of the patients with cardiac marker abnormalities (n=13, 54.17%) had the common NCP type, with only two (8.33%) of them having critically severe NCP needing ICU care. Meanwhile, the majority of patients (n=21, 91.30%) in the without cardiac marker abnormalities group had the common NCP type (Figure 2). Regarding clinical outcomes, in the AMI group, three patients died, two were still in admission, and one was discharged from hospital. Conversely, a majority of non-definite AMI patients with (n=20, 83.33%) and without (n=21, 91.30%) cardiac marker abnormalities were discharged, with no case of death.",
            "Risk factors for AMI To determine the risk factors for AMI in the COVID-19 patients, a bivariate analysis of AMI occurrence with clinical data and laboratory findings was performed, showing that age (r=0.456, p=0.001), CRP levels (r=0.483, p<0.001), NCP severity (r=0.540, p<0.001), and presence of commodities (r=0.520, p<0.001) were associated with AMI occurrence (all p<0.05). Further analysis (Table S2 in supplementary appendix) demonstrated that increased CRP levels (OR, 1.186; 95CI% [1.047, 1.344]), representing the inflammatory condition of the body, may be a risk factor for AMI in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with more severe NCP type (OR, 2.896; 95CI% [1.266, 6.621]) may have a higher risk of AMI than other patients. It is worth mentioning that the presence of comorbidities (OR, 4.336; 95CI% [1.11, 38.55]) may be the most critical risk factor for AMI in COVID-19 patients."

Although long-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients with AMI need to be further validated, significantly more clinical attention should be paid to avoid underdiagnosis because of classic symptoms and because of the possible overshadowing of cardiac complications in the context of coronavirus, as cautioned by the ACC Clinical Bulletin.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]",
            "To date, the underlying mechanisms of AMI and potential impacts in COVID-19 patients remain unknown. Clinically, the increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with cellular immune deficiency and coagulation activation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] Thus, the direct effects of the virus, cytokine storm induced by viral invasion, and sustained inflammatory response are presumed to be the main pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, a case report showing pathological findings from a severely infected COVID-19 patient revealed no obvious histological changes in heart tissue; however, the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 infection might not directly impair the heart is debatable because this finding was observed in only one patient without AMI-related clinical evidences.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] Because the three patients in our study who died all had extremely elevated cardiac marker levels, acute heart failure may play a fatal role in multiple organ dysfunction and accelerate death. However, further evidence is urgently needed to assess the mechanism of cardiac damage in large-sample autopsy or biopsy studies. Previous studies have indicated that SARS-CoV can mediate MI and damage associated with the downregulation of the myocardial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 system; this may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS, which has also been detected in COVID-19 patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] Until now, the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Although full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, the pathophysiological mechanism of cardiac infection or damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further validated in future studies.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]",
            "In our study, AMI usually occurred in COVID-19 patients with old age, underlying comorbidities, severe or critically severe NCP, and ARDS. Among 44,672 patients with confirmed COVID-19, as reported in the China CDC Weekly on Feb 11, 2020, approximately 31.2% patients were aged >60 years. The overall case fatality rate was 2.3% (1,023 deaths); more importantly, the majority (81%) of deaths occurred in patients aged \u226560 years or in those with underlying medical conditions.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] Similarly, in our study, all the six AMI patients were aged >60 years and had one or more underlying conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, COPD, and cardiovascular diseases. As described in a retrospective study of 1,099 laboratory-confirmed cases, approximately 25.2% of the patients had at least one underlying disorder, such as hypertension and COPD, and an underlying disorder potentially acts as an important risk factor for poor outcomes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] We found that the severity of NCP was closely correlated with the AMI occurrence. Meanwhile, ARDS was present in all the AMI patients. ARDS, as a severe complication, occurred in approximately 19%\u201329% NCP patients as per previous reports.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] Thus, we must understand the mechanisms of heart\u2013lung interactions in ARDS patients, particularly the right ventricle function impairments caused by respiratory dysfunction.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] Logistic regression analysis indicated that NCP severity was a risk factor for AMI in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, the outcomes of these patients need to be further determined in long-term follow-up studies.",
            "Our study has some limitations. First, this is a modest-size case series of hospitalized COVID-19 patients; more standardized data from a larger cohort would beneficial for further determining the clinical characteristics. Second, our data showed the clinical characteristics of AMI induced by COVID-19, including the clinical presentations, electrophysiological abnormality, myocardial enzyme and myocardial injury marker levels, and cardiac dysfunction and enlargement. However, the tissue characteristics in myocardial damage (i.e., edema, fibrosis, and microcirculation disorder) should be further demonstrated via cardiac magnetic resonance imaging examination as far as possible under the premise of controlling transmission. Finally, most of the COVID-19 patients with AMI had severe or critically severe NCP and high fatality rate, but long-term follow-up should be performed to determine adverse cardiac events in the patients who could not be diagnosed with MI but had elevated levels of one or more myocardial enzymes and myocardial injury markers.",
            "In summary, we found that cardiovascular complications are common in COVID-19 patients and include tachycardia, elevated myocardial enzyme levels, cardiac dysfunction, and even AMI. More importantly, CRP level elevation, NCP severity, and underlying cardiovascular diseases are the major risk factors for AMI in these patients."
