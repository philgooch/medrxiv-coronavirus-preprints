        "abstract": "Recently emerged Wuhan\u2019s novel coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2, a causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading its pathogenicity throughout the world now. More than 4000 mortalities have occurred worldwide till the writing of this article and this number is increasing every passing hour. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it as a global public health emergency. The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with already published reports on SARS-CoV-2 indicated that it is closely related to Bat-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome like coronavirus (Bat CoV SARS-like) and wellstudied Human SARS. In this study, we have exploited the complementary approach to examine the intrinsically disordered regions in proteome of SARS-CoV-2 using Bat SARSlike and Human SARS CoVs as comparative models. According to our findings, SARS-CoV2 proteome contains a significant amount of ordered proteins except Nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6. Further, cleavage sites in replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered. We have extensively investigated the dark proteome in SARS-CoV-2 which will have implications for the structured and unstructured biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses.",

            "Emerging Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recent pandemic and declared as a public health emergency by World Health Organization (WHO). Since its first case in December 2019 in Wuhan\u2019s seafood and meat market, China, it has now large scale socioeconomic impact globally (Yang et al, 2020). According to WHO, till 10th March 2020, the infections reached 109 countries (more than 0.1 million confirmed cases). Its symptoms include gastrointestinal tract complications, upper respiratory problems such as cough, cold, shortness of breath, and fever, and in some lethal conditions can cause mortality (Coronavirus disease 2019). According to the norms of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), SARS-CoV-2 comes under coronavirinae sub-family of coronaviridae family of order nidovirales. Nidovirales order viruses are enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses (Gorbalenya et al, 2006). The major variations among Nidovirus family occur in the number, type, and sizes of the structural proteins (Gorbalenya et al, 2006). The family coronaviridae comprises of vertebrate infecting viruses that transmit horizontally mainly through oral/fecal route and cause gastrointestinal and respiratory problems to the host (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCorman_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rCorman_et+al_2019_a\">Corman et al, 2019</a>). Sub-family coronavirinae consists of four genera, namely: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses based on the phylogenetic clustering of viruses (Woo et al, 2012; Cotten et al, 2013). Coronavirinae having the largest genomes for RNA viruses, incorporate ~30kb genomes inside the enveloped capsid. These viruses have variations among genome due to significant alterations in the structure and morphology of the nucleocapsids of virions (Masters, 2006). SARS-Coronavirus genomic RNA accommodates a 5\u2019 cap, leader sequence, UTR, a replicase gene, genes for structural and accessory protein, 3\u2019 UTR, and a poly-A tail (Figure 1). Twothird of genome codes for replicase gene (~20kb) containing genes for all non-structural viral proteins while the rest ~10kb genome contains genes for accessory proteins interspersed between the genes responsible for coding structural proteins (Masters, 2006). For the expression of structural and accessory proteins, additional transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS) are present within the viral genome. 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 UTRs contain stem-loop regions required for viral RNA synthesis (Hussain et al, 2005). The ~20kb (replicase gene) ssRNA is translated first into two long polyproteins: replicase polyprotein 1a and 1ab inside host cells. The newly formed polyproteins after cleavage by two viral proteases result in 16 non-structural proteins that perform a wide range of functions for viruses inside the host cell. They also induce ER-derived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) for viral replication and transcription. Structural proteins shape the outer cover of the virion, while accessory proteins are mostly involved in host immune evasion (Snijder et al, 2006; Sawicki et al, 2007). In this manuscript, we want to analyze the dark proteome of the SARS-CoV-2, so explaining a perspective on ordered and disordered proteome is essential. In classical structure-functionparadigm, a stable and defined 3-Dimensional structure is a prerequisite for a protein to accomplish its role. This notion dominated over the years before the idea of intrinsic disorder in protein structures came into full discussions and acceptance among the structural biologists. The other class of proteins fails to fold into well-defined structures and instead remain disordered under physiological buffer conditions. These proteins are called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Regions within proteins that contain unstructured segments are called intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). The property of being intrinsically disordered in proteins is determined by the amino acid sequences (Van Der Lee et al, 2014; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOldfield_2014_a\" href=\"#rOldfield_2014_a\">Oldfield & Dunker, 2014</a>; Wright & Dyson, 1999). IDPs exhibit their biological functions in signaling, gene regulation, and control processes by interacting with their physiological partners (Dunker et al, 2005, 2002, 2008; Liu et al, 2006; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cUversky_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rUversky_et+al_2005_a\">Uversky et al, 2005</a>).<br/><br/>Zhang and colleagues have reported the genomic sequence of the novel Wuhan seafood pneumonia virus or SARS-CoV-2 with GenBank accession number NC_045512 having 29,903 nucleotides. It was isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a patient and has been named finally as SARS-CoV-2 by WHO (Wu et al, 2020b).<br/><br/>As the IDPs are present in all three kingdoms of life, viral proteins often contain unstructured regions that have been strongly correlated with their virulence (Xue et al, 2010b; Giri et al, 2016; Singh et al, 2018; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWard_et+al_2004_a\" href=\"#rWard_et+al_2004_a\">Ward et al, 2004</a>). In this report, we designed our study to investigate the disordered side of the novel SARS-CoV-2 using computational approaches. We also have comprehensively analyzed the disordered regions among the closely related viruses; Human SARS and Bat CoV (SARS-like) like coronaviruses. As all three viruses have high similarity, therefore, it is a great approach to understand the structural and sequence properties. We believe that this study will help the structural and non-structural biologists to perform experiments for a more in-depth understanding of this virus. This will have certainly long-term implications for developing the new drugs or vaccines against this currently unpreventable infection."

            "Sequence retrieval and multiple sequence alignment: The protein sequences of Bat CoV (SARS-like), and Human SARS CoV were retrieved from UniProt (UniProt IDs for individual proteins are listed in the table 1). The translated sequences of SARS-CoV-2 proteins [GenBank database (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cClark_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rClark_et+al_2016_a\">Clark et al, 2016</a>) (Accession ID: NC_045512.2)] were obtained from GenBank. We used these sequences for performing multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and predicting the IDPRs. We have used Clustal Omega (Sievers et al, 2011) for protein sequence alignment and Esprit 3.0 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRobert_2014_a\" href=\"#rRobert_2014_a\">Robert & Gouet, 2014</a>) for constructing the aligned images.<br/><br/>Prediction of disordered regions: For prediction of intrinsic disorder in SARS virus proteomes, we have used multiple predictors: PONDR\u00ae (Predictor of Natural Disordered Regions) consortium [PONDR\u00aeVLS2 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPeng_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rPeng_et+al_2006_a\">Peng et al, 2006</a>), PONDR\u00aeVL3 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPeng_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rPeng_et+al_2005_a\">Peng et al, 2005</a>), PONDR\u00aeFIT (Xue et al, 2010a), PONDR\u00ae VLXT (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRomero_et+al_2001_a\" href=\"#rRomero_et+al_2001_a\">Romero et al, 2001</a>), IUPRED [Long and Short] (M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros et al, 2018). These artificial neural networks predict the residues which do not possess the tendency to form a structure in isolation. Additionally, two constructs of the IUPRED tool have also been utilized for the prediction of long and short IDPRs in query proteins. Residues with disorder score more than the 0.5 threshold values are considered as intrinsically disordered residues, whereas residues with the predicted disorder scores between 0.2 and 0.5 are considered flexible. Complete predicted percent of intrinsic disorder (PPID) was calculated for every protein of all the three viruses from outputs of six predictors. The detailed methodology has been given in our previous reports (Gadhave et al, 2020; Garg et al, 2019).<br/><br/>Combined CH-CDF analysis to predict disorder predisposition of proteins: Charge hydropathy plot (Uversky et al, 2000) and cumulative distribution function are two binary predictors of disorder which are available on the PONDR web server (https://www.pondr .com/). Combining the result from these binary predictors helps analyze the intrinsic disorder propensity of a protein-based on its charge, hydropathy and PONDR\u00aeVLXT score (Huang et al, 2012)."

            "<strong>Concluding remarks</strong><br/><br/>The emergence of viruses and associated deaths around the globe is a major concern to mankind. There is very little information available in the public domain regarding protein structure and functions of SARS-CoV-2 yet. Based on the similarity with Human SARS and Bat CoV, the published reports have suggested the functions of its proteins. Using available information on its genome and translated proteome from Genbank, we have carried out a comprehensive analysis of disorderedness present in proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a comparison is also made with its close relatives from the same group of beta coronaviruses; Human SARS and Bat CoV. As result suggested, the N proteins are predicted to be highly disordered having more than 60% of PPID. Another moderately disordered protein is encoded from ORF6, which downregulates the interferon pathway. All other proteins have shown less disordered regions depicting a three-dimensional structure in the native state. Generally, IDPs undergo structural transition upon association with their physiological partners, therefore, this study will help to understand the interaction of other viral proteins as well as host proteins in different physiological conditions. This will also guide structural biologists to carry out a structure-based analysis of its genome to explore the path for the development of new drugs and vaccines.<br/><br/>Future perspective: The periodical outbreaks of pathogens worldwide always remind the lack of suitable drugs or vaccines for proper cure or treatment. In 2003, nearly 750 deaths were reported due to the SARS outbreak in more than 24 countries, but this time, the outbreak of Wuhan's novel coronavirus has surpassed this number quickly indicating more causalities in near future. The lack of accurate information and ignorance of primary symptoms are major reasons which cause many infection cases. The actual reason for SARS-CoV-2 spread is still unknown but some assumptions made by researchers and Chinese authorities, and also confirmed its transmission from human to human. It also has made major impacts on education and economy worldwide due to several restrictions such as traveling, transportation. Due to advancements in distinguished techniques, the full genome sequence was made available in a few days of the first infection report from Wuhan, China. But further research needs to be done to identify its actual cause and suitable treatment in the coming future. There are certain possibilities that can be explored with the available information. More in-depth experimental studies using molecular and cell biology to establish structure-function relationships are required to understand its proper functioning. Additionally, based on homology and other information on protein-protein interaction, the associated viral and host proteins should be explored which help in carrying out replication, maturation, and ultimately pathogenesis. Using structural biology, various purposes including drug development could be achieved such as high throughput screening of compounds virtually as well as experimentally. The thorough experimental disorder analysis of three coronaviruses in this study will also help to structure biologists to design experiments keeping this information in mind.<br/><br/>Authors Contribution: RG: Conception and design, interpretation of data, writing, and review of the manuscript and study supervision.

The newly formed polyproteins after cleavage by two viral proteases result in 16 non-structural proteins that perform a wide range of functions for viruses inside the host cell. They also induce ER-derived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) for viral replication and transcription. Structural proteins shape the outer cover of the virion, while accessory proteins are mostly involved in host immune evasion (Snijder et al, 2006; Sawicki et al, 2007). In this manuscript, we want to analyze the dark proteome of the SARS-CoV-2, so explaining a perspective on ordered and disordered proteome is essential. In classical structure-functionparadigm, a stable and defined 3-Dimensional structure is a prerequisite for a protein to accomplish its role. This notion dominated over the years before the idea of intrinsic disorder in protein structures came into full discussions and acceptance among the structural biologists. The other class of proteins fails to fold into well-defined structures and instead remain disordered under physiological buffer conditions. These proteins are called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Regions within proteins that contain unstructured segments are called intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). The property of being intrinsically disordered in proteins is determined by the amino acid sequences (Van Der Lee et al, 2014; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOldfield_2014_a\" href=\"#rOldfield_2014_a\">Oldfield & Dunker, 2014</a>; Wright & Dyson, 1999). IDPs exhibit their biological functions in signaling, gene regulation, and control processes by interacting with their physiological partners (Dunker et al, 2005, 2002, 2008; Liu et al, 2006; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cUversky_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rUversky_et+al_2005_a\">Uversky et al, 2005</a>).",
            "Zhang and colleagues have reported the genomic sequence of the novel Wuhan seafood pneumonia virus or SARS-CoV-2 with GenBank accession number NC_045512 having 29,903 nucleotides. It was isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a patient and has been named finally as SARS-CoV-2 by WHO (Wu et al, 2020b).",
            "As the IDPs are present in all three kingdoms of life, viral proteins often contain unstructured regions that have been strongly correlated with their virulence (Xue et al, 2010b; Giri et al, 2016; Singh et al, 2018; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWard_et+al_2004_a\" href=\"#rWard_et+al_2004_a\">Ward et al, 2004</a>). In this report, we designed our study to investigate the disordered side of the novel SARS-CoV-2 using computational approaches. We also have comprehensively analyzed the disordered regions among the closely related viruses; Human SARS and Bat CoV (SARS-like) like coronaviruses. As all three viruses have high similarity, therefore, it is a great approach to understand the structural and sequence properties. We believe that this study will help the structural and non-structural biologists to perform experiments for a more in-depth understanding of this virus. This will have certainly long-term implications for developing the new drugs or vaccines against this currently unpreventable infection."

We used these sequences for performing multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and predicting the IDPRs. We have used Clustal Omega (Sievers et al, 2011) for protein sequence alignment and Esprit 3.0 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRobert_2014_a\" href=\"#rRobert_2014_a\">Robert & Gouet, 2014</a>) for constructing the aligned images.",

These artificial neural networks predict the residues which do not possess the tendency to form a structure in isolation. Additionally, two constructs of the IUPRED tool have also been utilized for the prediction of long and short IDPRs in query proteins. Residues with disorder score more than the 0.5 threshold values are considered as intrinsically disordered residues, whereas residues with the predicted disorder scores between 0.2 and 0.5 are considered flexible. Complete predicted percent of intrinsic disorder (PPID) was calculated for every protein of all the three viruses from outputs of six predictors. The detailed methodology has been given in our previous reports (Gadhave et al, 2020; Garg et al, 2019).",

            "Figures 2A, 2B and 2C are 2D-disorder plots of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV respectively and represent the PPIDPONDR-FIT vs PPIDMean plot. Based on the predicted levels of intrinsic disorder, proteins can be classified as highly ordered (PPID < 10%), moderately disordered (10% \u2264 PPID < 30%) and highly disordered (PPID \u2265 30%) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRajagopalan_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rRajagopalan_et+al_2011_a\">Rajagopalan et al, 2011</a>). From the data in table 1, figures 2A, 2B and 2C; as well as the PPID based classification, we conclude that the Nucleocapsid protein from all three strains of coronavirus possesses the highest percentage of the disorder. ORF3b protein in Bat Cov, ORF6 protein in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV and ORF9b protein in Human SARS and SARS CoV belong to the class of moderately disordered proteins. While the structured proteins, namely, Spike glycoprotein (S), Envelope protein (E) and Membrane protein (M) as well as accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8 (ORF8a and ORF8b in case of Human SARS) of all three strains of coronavirus are ordered. ORF14 and ORF10 proteins also belong to the class of ordered proteins.",
            "In order to further investigate the nature of the disorder in proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV; the results obtained from two binary classifiers of disorder; Charge hydropathy (CH) plot and Cumulative distribution function (CDF) plot were combined. This helped evaluate the disorder predisposition of the proteins based on their charge, hydropathy and PONDR\u00aeVLXT disorder scores. The CH plot is a linear classifier that differentiates between proteins that are predisposed to possess extended disordered regions and include random coils and pre-molten globules from proteins that have compact conformations (ordered proteins and molten globule like proteins). The other binary predictor, CDF is a nonlinear classifier as it uses PONDR\u00aeVLXT scores to discriminate ordered globular proteins from all disordered conformations, which include, native molten globules, premolten globules, and random coils. The CH-CDF plot can be divided into four quadrants: Q1, which is expected to include ordered proteins; Q2, which will include proteins predicted to be disordered by CDF and ordered by CH; Q3, which represents proteins that are predicted to be disordered by both CH and CDF analysis and Q4, which includes proteins disordered according to CH but ordered according to CDF analysis (Gadhave et al, 2020). Figures 2D, 2E and 2F represent the CH-CDF analysis of proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV and it can be observed that all the proteins are located within the two quadrants Q1 and Q2. The CH-CDF analysis leads to the conclusion that all proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are ordered except Nucleocapsid protein, which is predicted to be disordered by CDF but ordered by CH and hence lies in Q2.",

Spike binds to the virion M protein through its C-terminal transmembrane region (McBride et al, 2007). Belonging to a class I viral fusion protein, S protein binds to specific surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cell plasma membrane through its N-terminus receptor-binding domain (RBD) and mediates viral entry into host cells (Li et al, 2005). The protein consists of an N-terminal signal peptide, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBroer_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rBroer_et+al_2006_a\">Broer et al, 2006</a>). A 3.60 \u00c5 resolution structure (PDB ID: 6ACC) of S protein from Human SARS complexed with its host binding partner ACE2 has been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (Figure 3D). In this PDB structure, few residues (1-17, 240-243, 661-673, 812-831 and 1120-1203) are missing (Song et al, 2018). Structure of S protein (3.5 \u00c5) of SARS-CoV-2 has been recently deduced by Wrapp et. al., using electron microscopy. The biophysical analysis in their study has also revealed that the protein has a higher binding affinity to ACE2 than S protein of Human SARS (Wrapp et al, 2020).",
            "MSA analysis among all three coronaviruses demonstrates that S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a 77.71% sequence identity with Bat CoV and 77.14% identity with Human SARS (Supplementary Figure S1A). All three S proteins are found to have a conserved C-terminal region. However, the N-terminal regions of S proteins display noteworthy differences. Given that there is significant sequence variation at S RBD in N-terminus, this might be the reason behind variation in its virulence and its receptor-mediated binding and entry into the host cell. According to our analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity, S protein of all three studied coronaviruses are highly structured as their predicted disorder propensity lies below 10% (Table 1). The mean PPID score of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV is calculated to be 1.41%, 1.12%, and 1.85% respectively. Graphs in figures 3A, 3B and 3C represent the intrinsic disorder propensity of each residue in S protein of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV obtained from six disorder predictors. Envelope (E) glycoprotein: E Glycoprotein is a multifunctional inner membrane protein that plays an important role in the assembly and morphogenesis of virions in the cell (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRuch_2012_a\" href=\"#rRuch_2012_a\">Ruch & Machamer, 2012</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cUjike_2015_a\" href=\"#rUjike_2015_a\">Ujike & Taguchi, 2015</a>) (DeDiego et al, 2007).

Figure 4D shows the NMR-structure (PDB ID: 2MM4) of Human SARS envelope glycoprotein of 8-65 residues (Li et al, 2014).",
            "MSA results illustrate (Figure 4E) that this protein is highly conserved, with only three amino acid substitutions in E protein of SARS-CoV-2 conferring its 96% sequence similarity with Human SARS and Bat CoV. Bat CoV shares 100% sequence identity with Human SARS. Mean PPID calculated for SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV E proteins are 5.33%, 6.58%, and 6.58% respectively (Table 1). The E protein is found to have a reasonably well-predicted structure. Our predictions suggest that residues of N- and C-terminals are displaying a higher tendency for the disorder. The last 18 hydrophilic residues (59-76) have been reported to adopt a random-coil conformation with and without the addition of lipid membranes (Surya et al, 2013). Literature suggests that the last four amino acids of the Cterminal region of E protein containing a PZD-binding motif are involved in protein-protein interactions with a tight junction protein PALS1. PALS1 is involved in maintaining the polarity of epithelial cells in mammals (Teoh et al, 2010). We speculate that the disordered region content may be facilitating the interactions with other proteins as well. Respective graphs in figure 4A, 4B, and 4C indicates the predicted intrinsic disorder in E proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. Membrane (M) glycoproteins: M Glycoprotein plays an important role in virion assembly by interacting with the N, and E proteins (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTseng_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rTseng_et+al_2013_a\">Tseng et al, 2013</a>, 2010; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCorse_2003_a\" href=\"#rCorse_2003_a\">Corse & Machamer, 2003</a>). Protein M interacts specifically with a short viral packaging signal containing coronavirus RNA in the absence of N protein highlights an important nucleocapsid-independent viral RNA packaging mechanism inside host cells (Narayanan et al, 2003). It gains high-mannose N-glycans in ER which is modified into complex N-glycans in the Golgi complex. Glycosylation of M protein is observed to be not essential for virion fusion in cell culture (Nal et al, 2005; Voss et al, 2009). Cryo-EM and Tomography data indicate that M forms two distinct conformations: Compact M protein having high flexibility and low spike density; Elongated M protein having a rigid structure and narrow range of membrane curvature (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNeuman_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rNeuman_et+al_2011_a\">Neuman et al, 2011</a>). Regions of M glycoproteins are important as a dominant immunogen. This is reported as a deduced X-ray diffraction-based crystal structure (PDB ID: 3I6G) of HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, A-2 alpha chain, and Beta-2-microglobulin with small peptide of membrane glycoprotein (88-96 residues) complex in figure 5D (Liu et al, 2010).",

This is in line with the previous publication by Goh et al on Human SARS HKU4 where they found the mean PPID of 4% using additional predictors such as TopIDP and FoldIndex along with the predictors used in our study (Goh et al, 2013). Figures 5A, 5B and 5C show the graphs for the predisposition of intrinsic disorder in residues of M proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV.",
            "Nucleocapsid (N) protein: N protein is one of the major proteins playing a significant role in transcription, and virion assembly of coronaviruses (McBride et al, 2014). It binds to viral genomic RNA forming a ribonucleoprotein core required for encapsidation of RNA during viral particle assembly (Saikatendu et al, 2007). SARS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs) formation has been reported to depend upon either M and E proteins or M and N proteins. For effective production and release of VLPs, co-expression of E and N proteins has been found to be necessary with M protein (Siu et al, 2008).",

N protein has been demonstrated to bind viral RNA using both NTD and CTD (Chang et al, 2009). Figure 6D1 displays the resolved crystal structure (PDB ID: 1SSK) of Human SARS nucleocapsid protein (45-181 residues) (Huang et al, 2004).

In accordance with the previously calculated intrinsic disorder (Goh et al, 2013), N protein is highly disordered in all three SARS viruses (Table 1). Graphs in figure 6A, 6B, and 6C depicts the disorder in SARS-CoV-2 Human SARS, and Bat CoV nucleocapsid residues. that N and C-terminals are completely disordered with the central unstructured segment. As expected, N protein of novel coronavirus has similar residues showing the tendency for the disorder which is reported in Human SARS N protein prior to this study (Goh et al, 2013). The N and C-terminals are completely disordered with the central unstructured segment. In novel N protein, following residues 1-57, 64-102, 145-162, 166-289 and 362-422 are found to be disordered. The residues are lying within the NTD and CTD region which due to their structural plasticity were not crystallized in Human SARS N protein. SARS-CoV-2 has a disordered segment from 168-289 residues while Human SARS has predicted to have an unstructured segment from 145-289 residues.

Also known as P6, is a membrane-associated protein that serves as an interferon (IFN) antagonist (KopeckyBromberg et al, 2007). It downregulates the IFN pathway by blocking a nuclear import protein, karyopherin \u03b12. Using its C-terminal residues, ORF6 disrupts karyopherin import complex in the cytosol and, therefore, hampers the movement of transcription factors like STAT1 into the nucleus (Kopecky-Bromberg et al, 2007; Frieman et al, 2007). It contains a YSEL motif near its C-terminal region, which functions in protein internalization from the plasma membrane into the endosomal vesicles (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNetland_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rNetland_et+al_2007_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNetland_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rNetland_et+al_2007_a\">Netland et al, 2007</a></a>).

            "MSA results demonstrate that (Figure 9D), SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is closer to ORF6 protein of Human SARS, having a sequence similarity of 68.85% than ORF6 of Bat CoV (SARS-like) (67.21%). Novel SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is calculated to be the second most disordered structural protein with a PPID of 22.95%, especially, at the C-terminal region. Our analysis of intrinsic disorder using six predictors have revealed the mean PPID in ORF6 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are analyzed to be 22.95%, 20.63%, and 20.63% respectively (Table 1). Graphs in figures 9A, 9B and 9C illustrate the disorder for each residue in ORF6 proteins of all three studied coronaviruses. Moderately disordered protein ORF6 is predicted to have an intrinsic disorder near its C-terminal region (Figures 9A, B, C). These regions are significant for the biological activities of ORF6. As mentioned above, this hydrophilic region contains lysosomal targeting motif (YSEL) and diacidic motif (DDEE) responsible binding and recognition during translocation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNetland_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rNetland_et+al_2007_a\">Netland et al, 2007</a>). However, the N-terminal region is not showing any disordered prediction. The literature on Human SARS suggests that the 1-38 amino acid N-terminal region is alpha-helical and embedded in the membrane but not a transmembrane protein (Zhou et al, 2010). ORF7a and ORF7b: Alternatively called U122, ORF7a is a type I transmembrane protein (Fielding et al, 2004; Huang et al, 2006). It has been proven to localize in ER, Golgi, and peri-nuclear space. The presence of a KRKTE motif near the C-terminal imports the protein from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Fielding et al, 2004; Huang et al, 2006). It contributes to viral pathogenesis by activating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines like IL-8 and RANTES (Kanzawa et al, 2006; Law et al, 2005a). In another study, overexpression of BCL-XL in 293T cells blocked the ORF7a mediated apoptosis (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTan_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rTan_et+al_2007_a\">Tan et al, 2007</a>).

            "ORF8a and ORF8b: In animals and in isolates from early human infections, the ORF8 gene codes for a single ORF8 protein. However, it was observed that in late infections, at middle and late stages, a 29 nucleotide deletion led to the formation of two distinct proteins; ORF8a and ORF8b having 39 and 84 residues respectively (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOostra_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rOostra_et+al_2007_a\">Oostra et al, 2007a</a>; Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). Both proteins have a distinct conformation than the longer ORF8 protein. It has been reported that overexpression of ORF8b resulted in the downregulation of E protein while the proteins ORF8a and ORF8/ORF8ab have no effect on the expression of protein E. Also, ORF8/ORF8ab was found to interact very strongly with proteins S, ORF3a and ORF7a. ORF8a interacts with S and E proteins, whereas ORF8b protein interacts with E, M, ORF3a and ORF7a proteins (Keng et al, 2006).",

Our IDP analysis revealed no disorder in both ORF8 proteins (of SARSCoV-2, Bat CoV) as can be observed from the graphs in figures 12A and 12B. Both proteins are analyzed to be completely structured having a mean PPID of 0.00%. In ORF8a and ORF8b proteins of the Human SARS, the predicted disorder is estimated to be 2.56%, and 2.38% respectively (Table 1). Graphs in (Figures 13A and 13B) illustrate a little disorder near the end terminals of ORF8a and ORF8b proteins. ORF9b: This protein is expressed from an alternative ORF within the N gene through a leaky ribosome binding process (Xu et al, 2009). Inside host cells, ORF9b enters the nucleus which is a cell cycle independent process and passive entry. This has been shown to interact with a nuclear export protein receptor Exportin 1 (Crm1) using which it translocate out of the nucleus (Sharma et al, 2011). A 2.8\u00c5 resolved crystal structure (PDB ID: 2CME) of ORF9b protein of Human SARS exposed the presence of a dimeric tent-like   structure along with central hydrophobic amino acids (Figure 14D). The published structure has highly polarized distribution of charges with positively charged residues on one side and negatively charged on the other (Meier et al, 2006).",

X-ray diffraction-based crystal structure of ORF9b has a missing electron density of the first 8 residues and 26-37 residues near the central region. This might be because disordered regions are difficult to crystallize due to their highly dynamic structural conformations. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein with a mean PPID of 10.31% has a N-terminal (1-10 residues) predicted disordered segment. ORF9b of Bat coronavirus is analyzed to have an intrinsic disorder of 9.28%, comparatively lesser than Human SARS ORF9b protein.",

However, we have not done the IDPs analysis for ORF10 from the Bat-SLCoVZC45 strain since we have taken different strain of Bat CoV (reviewed strain HKU3-1) in our study.

Both contain non-structural proteins (Nsp1-10) in addition to different proteins required for viral replication and pathogenesis. Replicase polyprotein 1a contains an additional Nsp11 protein of 13 amino acids function of which is not investigated yet. The longer replicase polyprotein 1ab of 7073 amino acids accommodates five other non-structural proteins (Nsp12-16) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThiel_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rThiel_et+al_2003_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThiel_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rThiel_et+al_2003_a\">Thiel et al, 2003</a></a>).

The highest disorder was observed in Nsp8 of all three Coronaviruses. Both Nsp1 and Nsp8 are moderately disordered proteins (10% \u2264 PPID \u2264 30%). We also observed that Nsp2, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp6, Nsp7, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp15 and Nsp16 have disorder less than 10% and hence, belong to the category of highly ordered proteins. The other non-structural proteins, namely, Nsp4, Nsp12, Nsp13 and Nsp14 have negligible levels of disorder (PPID < 1%) which tells us that these are highly structured proteins.",

Based on the cleavage of replicase 1ab polyprotein of Human SARS by two proteases, we have shown disorder propensity at the cleavage sites with few residues spanning the terminals (Figure 18). Interestingly, we observed that all the cleavage sites are largely disordered, suggesting that intrinsic disorder may have a role in maturation of individual non-structural proteins. As the percentage identities of Nsps of Human SARS are closer with Nsps of SARS-CoV-2, we speculate the of presence of intrinsic disorder at the cleavage sites in polyproteins of SARS-CoV-2.

            "Non-structural protein 13 (Nsp13): Nsp13 functions as a viral helicase and unwinds dsDNA/dsRNA in 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 polarity (Adedeji et al, 2012). Recombinant Helicase expressed in E.coli Rosetta 2 strain has been reported to unwind ~280 bp per second (Adedeji et al, 2012). Figure 30D represents a 2.8\u00c5 X-ray diffraction-based crystal structure (PDB ID: 6JYT) of Human SARS Nsp13 protein. Helicase contains a  19- 20 loop on 1A domain which is primarily responsible for its unwinding activity. Moreover, the study revealed an important interaction of Nsp12 protein with Nsp13 that further enhances its helicase activity (Jia et al, 2019).",
            "The 601 amino acid long Nsp13 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is nearly conserved as it shares 99.83% with Nsp13 of Humans SARS and 98.84% with Nsp13 of Bat CoV (Supplementary Figure S2E). In accordance with our results, the mean PPIDs of all three Nsp13 proteins are estimated to be 0.67%. Figure 30A, 30B, and 30C show the respective graphs for the predisposition of intrinsic disorder in Nsp13 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. Figure 30D shows PDB structure of helicase/Nsp13 (PDB ID: 6JYT), from 53025902 residues (sienna colour). No significant disorder is revealed in all three Nsp13 proteins. Non-structural protein 14: Multifunctional nsp14 acts as an Exoribonuclease (ExoN) and methyltransferase (N7-Mtase) for SARS-Coronaviruses. It's 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 exonuclease activity lies in conserved DEDD residues related to exonuclease superfamily (Minskaia et al, 2006). Its guanine-N7 methyltransferase activity depends upon the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as a cofactor (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBouvet_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rBouvet_et+al_2010_a\">Bouvet et al, 2010</a>). As mentioned previously, nsp14 requires nsp10 protein in for activating its ExoN and N7-Mtase activity inside host cells. Figure 28D depicts the 3.2\u00c5 deduced crystal structure (PDB ID: 5C8T) of human SARS nsp10/nsp14 complex using the X-ray diffraction technique. Amino acids 1-287 form the ExoN domain and 288-527 residues from the N7-Mtase domain of nsp14. A loop present from 288-301 residues is essential for its N7-Mtase activity (Ma et al, 2015).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 protein shares a 95.07% percentage identity with Human SARS nsp14 and 94.69% with Bat CoV nsp14 (Supplementary Figure S2F). Mean PPID of nsp14 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and Human SARS is calculated to be 0.38% while nsp14 of Bat CoV has a mean PPID 0.57%. Predicted intrinsic disorder propensity in residues of nsp14 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are represented in graphs in figure 31A, 10B, and 31C. As can be observed from PPID values, all nsp14 proteins are found to be highly structured.",
            "Non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15): Nsp15 is a uridylate-specific RNA Endonuclease (NendoU) that creates a 2\u2032\u20133\u2032 cyclic phosphates after cleavage. Its endonuclease activity depends upon Mn2+ ions as co-factors. Conserved in Nidovirus, it acts as an important genetic marker due to its absence in other RNA viruses (Ivanov et al, 2004). As illustrated in figure 32D, Bruno and colleagues deduced a 2.6\u00c5 crystal structure (PDB ID: 2H85) of Uridylatespecific Nsp15 using X-ray diffraction. The monomeric Nsp15 has three domains: N-terminal domain (1-62 residues) formed by a three anti-parallel  -sheets and two \u03b1-helices packed together; a middle domain (63\u2013191 residues) contains an \u03b1-helix connect to a 39 amino acids long coil to two \u03b1 and five   region; and a C-terminal domain (192\u2013345 residues) consisting of two anti-parallel three  -sheets on each side of a central \u03b1-helical core (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRicagno_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rRicagno_et+al_2006_a\">Ricagno et al, 2006</a>).",
            "Nsp15 protein is found to be quite conserved across human and bat CoVs. It shares an 88.73% sequence identity with Nsp15 of Human SARS and 88.15% with Nsp15 of Bat CoV (Supplementary Figure S2G). Calculated mean PPID of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV is 1.73%, 2.60%, and 2.60%, respectively. Predicted intrinsic disorder propensity in residues of Nsp15 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 Human SARS and Bat CoV are represented in graphs in figure 32A, 32B, and 32C. No significant disorder was revealed in studied Nsp15 proteins. Non-structural protein 16 (Nsp16): Nsp16 protein is another Mtase domain-containing protein. As methylation of coronavirus mRNAs occurs in steps, three protein Nsp10, Nsp14 and Nsp16 acts one after another. The first event requires the initiation trigger from Nsp10 protein after which Nsp14 methylates capped mRNAs forming cap-0 (7Me) GpppA-RNAs. Nsp16 protein along with its co-activator protein Nsp10 acts on cap-0 (7Me) GpppA-RNAs to give rise to final cap-1 (7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)-RNAs (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBouvet_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rBouvet_et+al_2010_a\">Bouvet et al, 2010</a>; Decroly et al, 2008).

            "Nsp16 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is found equally similar with Nsp16 proteins of Human SARS and Bat CoV (93.29%) (Supplementary Figure S2H). As observed using different predictors, mean PPIDs SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are 5.37%, 3.02%, and 3.02%. Graphs in figure 33A, 33B, and 33C show the predicted predisposition for intrinsic disorder in nsp16 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV, respectively. We found no disorder in Nsp16 proteins which are observed to be structured. Replicase polyprotein 1a: As 1a contains identical non-structural proteins 1-10 with 1ab, therefore, we have not performed their IDP analysis separately. However, it has one additional non-structural protein designated as Nsp11.",
            "Non-structural protein 11 (Nsp11): This is an uncharacterized protein cleaved from replicase polyprotein 1a. The small protein with unknown function requires experimental insights to further characterize this protein. The software used in this study requires >30 amino acid sequence, therefore, due to short sequence of all three studied coronaviruses Nsp11 proteins do not show any disordered residue. MSA of Nsp11 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is found to have a similarity of 84.62% with Nsp11 proteins of Human SARS and Bat CoV (Figure 34).",
            "Concluding remarks: The emergence of viruses and associated deaths around the globe is a major concern to mankind. There is very little information available in the public domain regarding protein structure and functions of SARS-CoV-2 yet. Based on the similarity with Human SARS and Bat CoV, the published reports have suggested the functions of its proteins. Using available information on its genome and translated proteome from Genbank, we have carried out a comprehensive analysis of disorderedness present in proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a comparison is also made with its close relatives from the same group of beta coronaviruses; Human SARS and Bat CoV. As result suggested, the N proteins are predicted to be highly disordered having more than 60% of PPID. Another moderately disordered protein is encoded from ORF6, which downregulates the interferon pathway. All other proteins have shown less disordered regions depicting a three-dimensional structure in the native state. Generally, IDPs undergo structural transition upon association with their physiological partners, therefore, this study will help to understand the interaction of other viral proteins as well as host proteins in different physiological conditions. This will also guide structural biologists to carry out a structure-based analysis of its genome to explore the path for the development of new drugs and vaccines.",
            "Future perspective: The periodical outbreaks of pathogens worldwide always remind the lack of suitable drugs or vaccines for proper cure or treatment. In 2003, nearly 750 deaths were reported due to the SARS outbreak in more than 24 countries, but this time, the outbreak of Wuhan's novel coronavirus has surpassed this number quickly indicating more causalities in near future. The lack of accurate information and ignorance of primary symptoms are major reasons which cause many infection cases. The actual reason for SARS-CoV-2 spread is still unknown but some assumptions made by researchers and Chinese authorities, and also confirmed its transmission from human to human. It also has made major impacts on education and economy worldwide due to several restrictions such as traveling, transportation. Due to advancements in distinguished techniques, the full genome sequence was made available in a few days of the first infection report from Wuhan, China. But further research needs to be done to identify its actual cause and suitable treatment in the coming future. There are certain possibilities that can be explored with the available information. More in-depth experimental studies using molecular and cell biology to establish structure-function relationships are required to understand its proper functioning. Additionally, based on homology and other information on protein-protein interaction, the associated viral and host proteins should be explored which help in carrying out replication, maturation, and ultimately pathogenesis. Using structural biology, various purposes including drug development could be achieved such as high throughput screening of compounds virtually as well as experimentally. The thorough experimental disorder analysis of three coronaviruses in this study will also help to structure biologists to design experiments keeping this information in mind.",
