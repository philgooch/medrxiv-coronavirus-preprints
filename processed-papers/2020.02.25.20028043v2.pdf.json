        "abstract": "Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene and medical staff protection. It is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals. Objective: To detect the presence of COVID-19 in the samples from the area at risk of contamination in the First Hospital of Jilin University. Methods: Viruses in the air were collected by natural sedimentation and air particle sampler methods. Predetermined environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs at seven o'clock in the morning before disinfection. The real-time reverse-transcription PCR method was used to detect the existence of COVID-19 pathogens. Results: Viruses could be detected on the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients and in the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care patient. Conclusion: Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during pandemic outbreaks is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control. It is of great significance to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control through the monitoring of environmental hygiene. Key words COVID-19; hospital environmental hygiene; hospital-associated infection, medical staff protection",

            "The outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in December 2019 has led to a serious public health event unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene. The occurrence of medical staff-associated infections is closely related to long-lived pathogens in the hospital environment to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of<br/><br/>COVID-19 in hospitals. The Chinese government quickly adopted quarantine measures for confirmed and suspected patients to restrain the spread of the pandemic[6]. Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during the outbreak of the pandemic is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control [5,7]<br/><br/>the reemergence of COVID-19 or similar viruses. Therefore, it is of great significance to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control through the monitoring of environmental hygiene. According to a report from the<br/><br/>China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of February 11, 3019 medical staff members were infected with the new coronavirus (including confirmed cases, suspected cases, clinically diagnosed cases, and asymptomatic infections, of which were confirmed cases), indicating that infection through no occupational exposure may occur<br/><br/>Meanwhile, it is extremely important to ensure the safety of medical treatments and the quality of hospital infection control by monitoring hospital environmental hygiene.    [1-3]<br/><br/>. Meanwhile, the outbreak of this novel virus has placed [4,5]<br/><br/>. Thus, it is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene<br/><br/>. It also increases understanding of the environmental challenges corresponding to<br/><br/>, but more evidence is needed to support this hypothesis.    [8]<br/><br/>However, sensitive and effective methods for monitoring hospital-acquired infection control are still limited. Here, by monitoring COVID-19 and detecting nucleic acid, we reveal clinical data indicating hospital environmental hygiene levels and provide a way to monitor pathogenic microorganism contamination and nosocomial infections."
