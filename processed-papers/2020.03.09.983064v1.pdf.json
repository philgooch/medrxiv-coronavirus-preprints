        "abstract": "Epidemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) now have more than 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by RT-qPCR methods, but the capacity of RT-qPCR methods is limited by its requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. Here, we developed and evaluated RT-LAMP assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19. RT-LAMP assays in this study can detect as low as 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cross-reactivity of RT-LAMP assays to other human Coronaviruses was not observed. We also adapted a colorimetric detection method for our RT-LAMP assay so that the tests potentially performed in higher throughput.",

The results of these RT-LAMP assays can be detected within 30 minutes after amplification reaction begin. In addition, we provided optimized reaction conditions to which LCV colorimetric detection method is applied that can be used for point-of-care tests."

Although RT-qPCR methods are used as the goldstandard for detection of pathogens due to its high sensitivity and specificity, it still have some caveats. Briefly, lab-level facility such as reliable supply of electricity, expensive instruments and trained personnel are required to properly perform RT-qPCR tests. These restrictions hinder to utilize RTqPCR methods for various point-of-care where pathogen detection might be required [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].<br/><br/>To overcome such cost-restriction of RT-qPCR and still detect pathogens\u2019 nucleic acids, isothermal amplification methods have been developed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Among such methods, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method has some advantages to be applied for point-of-care test (POCT) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Well optimized LAMP assay shows sensitivity comparable to that of PCR, less than 10 copies per reaction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].

In vitro transcription template for hCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV were prepared by restriction enzyme cut with BamHI-XhoI or SspI-XhoI, respectively. In vitro transcriptions were done with EZTM T7 High Yield In Vitro Transcription kit (Enzynomics) as manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

            "LAMP Primer Design Five SARS-CoV-2 sequences (MN908947, MN938384, MN988713, MN985325, and MN975262) and seven SARS-CoV sequences (NC_004718, AY613947, AY313906, AY559094, AY502924, AY278491, and AY502927) were aligned by MEGA7 software.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] SARS-CoV-2 specific regions for LAMP primer design are manually selected: two regions from Nsp3 (3055 \u2013 3591, 6172 \u2013 7273), two regions from Spike (S) (21540 \u2013 22549, 22890 \u2013 23779), and one region from Orf8 (27824 \u2013 28396). Whole Nucleocapsid (N) gene region is also included as N is usual target of molecular diagnosis due to abundance of its mRNA.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Two to five basic LAMP primer sets are designed and selected with PrimerExplorer V5 (http://primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html) for each target region. Loop primers are designed by PrimerExplorer V5 or manually selected. 16 LAMP primer sets with proper both of Loop Forward (LF) primer and Loop Backward (LB) primer are selected and subjected to further screening.<br/><br/>LAMP Primer Screening First round of screening was done using WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix with cDNA of which corresponding RNA concentration is 8.3 x 104 copies/reaction. Nine out of 16 primer sets were selected by threshold time from the results of 40 minutes incubation at 65\u00b0C and subjected to further screening. Second round of screening was done using Bst3.0. The same amount of cDNA as the first round of screening is used. Two primer sets that showed relatively early non-specific amplification are discarded and remaining seven primer sets are subjected to further screening.<br/><br/>Third and fourth rounds of screening were done by checking sensitivity to dilutions of cDNA and RNA, respectively. Five out of seven primer sets showed specific amplification for at least one replicate of duplicate with cDNA concentration corresponding to 1.7 x 101 copies of input RNA (Supplementary Figure 1). Next, we evaluated sensitivity of the five primer sets to RNA dilutions in RT-LAMP using Bst3.0 and SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase. Two primer sets, both targeting Nsp3, showed best sensitivity that showed specific amplification at 10-6 dilution of RNA (Figure 1). We also added two primer sets, one targeting S and the other targeting N, for reaction optimization experiments as they showed fast threshold time for cDNA and to keep ranges of target genes. Primer sequences are represented in Table 1.<br/><br/>LAMP Reaction Optimization To optimize RT-LAMP reaction with Bst3.0, we first evaluated optimal concentration of dNTP and Mg2+ for each primer set. Three dNTP- Mg2+ concentration combinations are tested at 69\u00b0C: dNTP 1.4 mM and Mg2+ 8 mM, dNTP 1.4 mM and Mg2+ 6 mM, dNTP 1 mM and Mg2+ 6 mM. The copy number of RNA template was 1,000 copies per reaction. Best concentration combination was selected for each primer set by whether both of duplicate show specific amplification and by threshold time. Average threshold time (Tt_av) and corresponding dNTP and Mg2+ concentrations are as follows: dNTP 1 mM and Mg2+ 6 mM for \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d (Tt_av = 11.93), dNTP 1.4 mM and Mg2+ 8 mM for \u201cNsp3_2-24\u201d (Tt_av = 7.74), dNTP 1.4mM and Mg2+ 6mM for \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d and \u201cN_21\u201d (Tt_av = 11.08 and 5.50, respectively).<br/><br/>Next, we checked if amplification is improved at lower temperature (65\u00b0C) because optimal reaction temperature of SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase is 50-55\u00b0C and manufacturer recommend 65-72\u00b0C for optimal performance of Bst3.0. Notably, \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d and \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d primer sets show improved threshold time (Tt_av = 8.92 and 8.49, respectively).<br/><br/>Assessing Limit of Detection and Cross-Reactivity<br/><br/>The Limit of Detection (LoD) of optimized RT-LAMP assays were assessed through 5 to 1000 RNA copies/reaction in triplicate. Among four primer sets subjected to reaction optimization, \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d and \u201cN_21\u201d sets showed relatively poor sensitivity. For \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d and \u201cNsp3_2-24\u201d primer sets, we additionally evaluated LoD with 2-fold SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (20U/reaction). LoD and Tt_av were improved by increasing reverse transcriptase amount. (Table 2, Supplementary Figure 2) As a result, both \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d and \u201cNsp3_2-24\u201d RT-LAMP assays could detect as low RNA concentration as 100 copies per reaction.<br/><br/>The cross-reactivity of two SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assays targeting Nsp3 to other human Coronaviruses was not found for hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV (Figure 2)."

        "conclusion": [
            "In this study, we designed and screened LAMP primer sets targeting SARS-CoV-2. Reaction optimization was also performed for selected primer sets. In summary, we designed and evaluated a pair of RT-LAMP assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 with limit of detection of 100 copies per reaction. Our RT-LAMP assays showed specificity to SARS-CoV-2 versus alphacoronavirus (hCoV-229E), betacoronavirus (hCoV-OC43) and MERS-CoV. Although we could not test specificity to SARS-CoV because proper sample was not in our hand, specificity of the RT-LAMP assays are easily expectable from the mismatching bases in primer binding sites (Figure 1). Especially, both of F1/B1 sites of \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d primer set is in SARS-CoV-2 specific region of which aligning SARS-CoV sequence is not exist.<br/><br/>About the sensitivity of LAMP assays, note that average threshold time is not well correlated with limit of detection. In fact, average threshold time of \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d and \u201cN_21\u201d primer sets for 1000 copies were faster than that of \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d: 7.33 (RPR: 2/3) and 5.06 (RPR: 1/3) minutes, respectively. This dis-relation is previously reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>].One peculiar observation is that both \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d and \u201cN_21\u201d showed good sensitivity to cDNA template (Supplementary Figure 1) unlike to RNA. Observed difference of sensitivity to RNA and cDNA seems significant even we account slight amplification that might happened during reverse transcription. The reason may include stochastic nature of forming proper LAMP amplification intermediate - \u201cdumbbell\u201d structure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], higher stability of DNA:RNA double strand than DNA:DNA double strand and more.<br/><br/>The limit of detection of RT-LAMP assays suggested in this study, 100 copies per reaction, may not enough for sensitive screening of suspicious patients. This relatively high limit of detection would be from the target sequences used for primer design that are selected by specificity versus SARS-CoV. Indeed, target GC percentage and Tm of primers had to be adjusted to get enough number of starting sets for primer screening during LAMP primer design to give less-optimal primer sets. Therefore, there might be better target sequences for LAMP assay of SARS-CoV-2 in the view point of sensitivity. However, expected high specificity of RT-LAMP assays suggested in this study would be a good feature for a confirmatory test. In addition, considering high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 at early stage after symptom onset [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], suggested RT-LAMP assays may still be usable for screening tests.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we developed highly specific RT-LAMP assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The results of these RT-LAMP assays can be detected within 30 minutes after amplification reaction begin. In addition, we provided optimized reaction conditions to which LCV colorimetric detection method is applied that can be used for point-of-care tests."

            "LAMP Primer Design Five SARS-CoV-2 sequences (MN908947, MN938384, MN988713, MN985325, and MN975262) and seven SARS-CoV sequences (NC_004718, AY613947, AY313906, AY559094, AY502924, AY278491, and AY502927) were aligned by MEGA7 software.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] SARS-CoV-2 specific regions for LAMP primer design are manually selected: two regions from Nsp3 (3055 \u2013 3591, 6172 \u2013 7273), two regions from Spike (S) (21540 \u2013 22549, 22890 \u2013 23779), and one region from Orf8 (27824 \u2013 28396). Whole Nucleocapsid (N) gene region is also included as N is usual target of molecular diagnosis due to abundance of its mRNA.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Two to five basic LAMP primer sets are designed and selected with PrimerExplorer V5 (http://primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html) for each target region. Loop primers are designed by PrimerExplorer V5 or manually selected. 16 LAMP primer sets with proper both of Loop Forward (LF) primer and Loop Backward (LB) primer are selected and subjected to further screening.",
            "LAMP Primer Screening First round of screening was done using WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix with cDNA of which corresponding RNA concentration is 8.3 x 104 copies/reaction. Nine out of 16 primer sets were selected by threshold time from the results of 40 minutes incubation at 65\u00b0C and subjected to further screening. Second round of screening was done using Bst3.0. The same amount of cDNA as the first round of screening is used. Two primer sets that showed relatively early non-specific amplification are discarded and remaining seven primer sets are subjected to further screening.",
            "Third and fourth rounds of screening were done by checking sensitivity to dilutions of cDNA and RNA, respectively. Five out of seven primer sets showed specific amplification for at least one replicate of duplicate with cDNA concentration corresponding to 1.7 x 101 copies of input RNA (Supplementary Figure 1). Next, we evaluated sensitivity of the five primer sets to RNA dilutions in RT-LAMP using Bst3.0 and SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase. Two primer sets, both targeting Nsp3, showed best sensitivity that showed specific amplification at 10-6 dilution of RNA (Figure 1). We also added two primer sets, one targeting S and the other targeting N, for reaction optimization experiments as they showed fast threshold time for cDNA and to keep ranges of target genes. Primer sequences are represented in Table 1.",
            "LAMP Reaction Optimization To optimize RT-LAMP reaction with Bst3.0, we first evaluated optimal concentration of dNTP and Mg2+ for each primer set. Three dNTP- Mg2+ concentration combinations are tested at 69\u00b0C: dNTP 1.4 mM and Mg2+ 8 mM, dNTP 1.4 mM and Mg2+ 6 mM, dNTP 1 mM and Mg2+ 6 mM. The copy number of RNA template was 1,000 copies per reaction. Best concentration combination was selected for each primer set by whether both of duplicate show specific amplification and by threshold time. Average threshold time (Tt_av) and corresponding dNTP and Mg2+ concentrations are as follows: dNTP 1 mM and Mg2+ 6 mM for \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d (Tt_av = 11.93), dNTP 1.4 mM and Mg2+ 8 mM for \u201cNsp3_2-24\u201d (Tt_av = 7.74), dNTP 1.4mM and Mg2+ 6mM for \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d and \u201cN_21\u201d (Tt_av = 11.08 and 5.50, respectively).",
            "Next, we checked if amplification is improved at lower temperature (65\u00b0C) because optimal reaction temperature of SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase is 50-55\u00b0C and manufacturer recommend 65-72\u00b0C for optimal performance of Bst3.0. Notably, \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d and \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d primer sets show improved threshold time (Tt_av = 8.92 and 8.49, respectively).",
            "The Limit of Detection (LoD) of optimized RT-LAMP assays were assessed through 5 to 1000 RNA copies/reaction in triplicate. Among four primer sets subjected to reaction optimization, \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d and \u201cN_21\u201d sets showed relatively poor sensitivity. For \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d and \u201cNsp3_2-24\u201d primer sets, we additionally evaluated LoD with 2-fold SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (20U/reaction). LoD and Tt_av were improved by increasing reverse transcriptase amount. (Table 2, Supplementary Figure 2) As a result, both \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d and \u201cNsp3_2-24\u201d RT-LAMP assays could detect as low RNA concentration as 100 copies per reaction.",
            "The cross-reactivity of two SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assays targeting Nsp3 to other human Coronaviruses was not found for hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV (Figure 2).",
            "Discussions and Conclusion In this study, we designed and screened LAMP primer sets targeting SARS-CoV-2. Reaction optimization was also performed for selected primer sets. In summary, we designed and evaluated a pair of RT-LAMP assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 with limit of detection of 100 copies per reaction. Our RT-LAMP assays showed specificity to SARS-CoV-2 versus alphacoronavirus (hCoV-229E), betacoronavirus (hCoV-OC43) and MERS-CoV. Although we could not test specificity to SARS-CoV because proper sample was not in our hand, specificity of the RT-LAMP assays are easily expectable from the mismatching bases in primer binding sites (Figure 1). Especially, both of F1/B1 sites of \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d primer set is in SARS-CoV-2 specific region of which aligning SARS-CoV sequence is not exist.",
            "About the sensitivity of LAMP assays, note that average threshold time is not well correlated with limit of detection. In fact, average threshold time of \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d and \u201cN_21\u201d primer sets for 1000 copies were faster than that of \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d: 7.33 (RPR: 2/3) and 5.06 (RPR: 1/3) minutes, respectively. This dis-relation is previously reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>].One peculiar observation is that both \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d and \u201cN_21\u201d showed good sensitivity to cDNA template (Supplementary Figure 1) unlike to RNA. Observed difference of sensitivity to RNA and cDNA seems significant even we account slight amplification that might happened during reverse transcription. The reason may include stochastic nature of forming proper LAMP amplification intermediate - \u201cdumbbell\u201d structure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], higher stability of DNA:RNA double strand than DNA:DNA double strand and more.",
            "The limit of detection of RT-LAMP assays suggested in this study, 100 copies per reaction, may not enough for sensitive screening of suspicious patients. This relatively high limit of detection would be from the target sequences used for primer design that are selected by specificity versus SARS-CoV. Indeed, target GC percentage and Tm of primers had to be adjusted to get enough number of starting sets for primer screening during LAMP primer design to give less-optimal primer sets. Therefore, there might be better target sequences for LAMP assay of SARS-CoV-2 in the view point of sensitivity. However, expected high specificity of RT-LAMP assays suggested in this study would be a good feature for a confirmatory test. In addition, considering high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 at early stage after symptom onset [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], suggested RT-LAMP assays may still be usable for screening tests.",
            "In conclusion, we developed highly specific RT-LAMP assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The results of these RT-LAMP assays can be detected within 30 minutes after amplification reaction begin. In addition, we provided optimized reaction conditions to which LCV colorimetric detection method is applied that can be used for point-of-care tests."
