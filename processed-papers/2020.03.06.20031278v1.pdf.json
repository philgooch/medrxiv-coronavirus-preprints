            "In conclusion, our study showed that over half of the fMW had sleep disturbances in the outbreak of COVID-19. fMW had higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-fMW. And female fMW showed severer sleep disturbances compared to male fMW. Further interventions should be administrated for fMW, aiming to maintain their healthy condition and guarantee their professional performance in the battle with COVID-19. However, further prospective randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate our results."

Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>7 points or/and AIS>6<br/><br/>points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS and prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for different gender in fMW was conducted.",
            "Study Samples This cross-sectional study included medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei<br/><br/>Province, China. The institutional ethics review boards of the participating hospitals approved this study. The study protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was waived due to the cross-sectional nature of this study. All of subjects included in the study were anonymous and volunteered to participate. Subjects were divided into two groups according to the existence of directive exposure to COVID-19 patients, including fMW and non-fMW. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (a) age older than 18 years old; (b) medical workers from hospitals in Hubei Province, including local medical workers and supportive medical workers from other Chinese regions; (c) involved in the battle with COVID-19 directly or/and indirectly, and (d) volunteered to participate in the survey. The exclusion criteria were listed as follows: (a) has been diagnosed as sleep disturbances; (b) sleep quality was affected by physical or psychological diseases; (c) sleep quality was affected by negative personal events; (d) within the treatment course for mental or/and physical diseases and (d) incomplete data of the online questionnaires.    Data Collection<br/><br/>The online survey was conducted in February 2020 among medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, with the contents encompassing basic information (age, gender, marriage, education level and etc.), epidemiological investigation, details of work, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens<br/><br/>Insomnia Scale (AIS) ,Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the factors influencing sleep quality, ect. PSQI is a self-reported questionnaire which assesses subjective sleep quality within one month. It comprises of seven components, including sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, sleep medication and daytime function. A subject with total score > 7 points is defined as poor sleep quality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. In general, the higher the PSQI, the worse the sleep quality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. AIS is a brief instrument to assess the severity of insomnia. It contains eight items with each item rated from 0 to 3 points. The sum of eight items\u2019 scores is regarded as total score. A subject with total score > 6 points is diagnosed as insomnia. In general, the higher the AIS, the severer the insomnia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. A 10-items VAS measure was used to investigate emotional status of subjects, including work pressure, attention, anxiety, energy, confidence, irritability, stress, impatience, fear and depression. The VAS was conducted online as a horizontal graphic slider, which was divided into ten segments from 1 (weakest) to 10 (strongest). The VAS scores could represent the degree of their feelings. Higher scores indicate stronger feeling of each emotional state. We used scores of VAS to compare anxiety and depression between fMW and non-fMW.    Study Objective<br/><br/>The sleep disturbances were mainly confirmed by the scores of PSQI and AIS, with PSQI > 7 points or/and AIS > 6 points. The main study objective was to compare the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression between fMW group and non-fMW group. In addition, we compared the prevalence of sleep disturbances in two groups, aiming to reflect the overall level of sleep quality for medical workers in different work environments.<br/><br/>Statistical Analysis<br/><br/>Categorical variables were described as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were described as the mean \u00b1 SDs. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 for Windows (IBM, Somers, NY). The demographic characteristics were compared by non-parametric test for continuous variables and by Pearson\u2019s chi-square test for categorical variables between two groups. The scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS were compared by ANOVA. The variables with significant differences between two groups in demographic characteristics were described as covariants and joined in the process of ANOVA. In the subgroup analysis of fMW, the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS were compared by ANOVA between male and female fMW. A P-value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance in all statistical analyses. Partial correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the correlation between PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression."

The outbreak of COVID-19 in China remains to be a serious challenge for fMW. There is no doubt that they are not only under high risk of being infected with the disease but also high mental stress, which may lead to acute sleep disturbances or mental disorders. However, as far as we know, few studies have concentrated on the sleep disturbances of fMW under the emergent events of public health, especially in the outbreak of COVID-19.<br/><br/>Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the sleep disturbances of fMW in the battle with COVID-19, and made a comparison with non-fMW."
        ],
        "discussion": [
            "The outbreak of COVID-19 in China has aroused extensive public concern in recent months [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Many countries are also experiencing the invasion of COVID-19, such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, Iran, etc [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. The rapid spread of the disease and inadequate early realization toward COVID-19 challenged the healthy institutions in many countries. In addition, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2.3%, and medical workers accounted for 3.8% in COVID-19 patients, as reported by the latest epidemiological study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Previous studies have indicated that in ordinary times, medical workers were vulnerable to sleep disturbances, which may be higher than the general population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that fMW under the outbreak of COVID-19 in China may be more susceptible to sleep disturbances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the sleep disturbances of fMW under the outbreak of COVID-19.<br/><br/>Although sleep disturbances distribute widely among the population, the prevalence varies among different occupations and work pressure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. A USA National Health Interview Survey showed short sleep duration disturbed 29.9% of civilian employed workers, including 40.5% of enterprise managers, 37.1% of transportation/warehousing and 34.8% of manufacturing, and indicated that sleep disturbances have increased over the past decades [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Similarly, a nationwide study in China demonstrated that civil servants had the shortest sleep duration (Mean 7.85 hours) and the worst sleep equality, who may experience with more work pressure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Meanwhile, 64.1% of police officers had PSQI > 5 points, and were regarded as sleep disturbances as reported. Their sleep disturbances were related to posttraumatic stress and general psychopathology [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. A survey from Japan indicated that high occupational stress was significantly associated with insomnia, especially the presence of high efforts but low reward [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. And exposure to long working hours and irregular work shifts may attribute to stress, fatigue and chronic diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], which may influence the quantity and quality of sleep [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Schiller et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] compared sleep quality and sleep duration between full worktime subjects and 75% reduced worktime subjects, and found the latter presented with improved sleep quality and sleep duration. The reduction of worktime may be useful for alleviating sleep disturbances.<br/><br/>Accompanied with long working hours, frequent day-night shifts, excessive workload and high stress, medical workers were vulnerable to sleep disturbances or sleep deprivation all over the world [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. Pikovsky et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. found that 63% and 49% of medical residents presented with low professional performance and judgement levels after the night shifts, respectively. The long working hours could potentially increase the fatigue of medical workers and be linked to the occurrence of medical errors [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. Meanwhile, sleep deprivation could influence the medical workers in making quick and appropriate decisions for patients, which was fatal to patient care [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. Deng et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. reported that job difficulty, doctor-patient relationship, psychosomatic state, environment or events, promotion or competition and total pressure scores were related to sleep disturbances for community nurses. Tucker et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. found moderate work time control for medical workers could improve the sleep quantity that frequent nigh work resulted in, and work time control had association with fewer sleep disturbances. Therefore, it is rational to believe that increased work stress plays a critical role in sleep disturbances of medical workers. With the booming of Chinese economy in past decades, patient visits per physician in China increased by 135% and inpatient admissions per physician rose by 184%. Workload has increased dramatically for Chinese physicians, which exerted a trend that potentially threatened physicians\u2019 health and quality of patient care [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. The prevalence of sleep disturbances in Chinese medical workers was 12.9%-78% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. The present study showed that over 50% of fMW under the outbreak of COVID-19 had sleep disturbances. Although it is even higher than that of in normal times, the prevalence is still compatible to previous results from China. The high prevalence of sleep disturbances of fMW in battle with COVID-19 should be put much emphasize. It was reported that sleep characteristics may exert critical effects on immune functions, which may increase the inflammatory response to sleep deprivation and exert negative feedback to aggravate the short sleep duration and increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disorders [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. Thus, sleep disturbances would further increase the possibility of fMW being infected with COVID-19 owing to affected immune system. Therefore, it is imperative to concern on sleep disturbances of fMW, aiming to maintain their healthy condition and guarantee their professional performance in the battle with COVID-19.<br/><br/>Our study showed that the overall scores of PSQI and AIS for fWM were significantly higher than that of non-fWM, which indicated fMW had worse sleep compared to non-fMW. There were 67.2% and 51.7% of fMW with PSQI > 7 points and AIS > 6 points, respectively, which were regarded as having sleep disturbances. Our study also demonstrated that the fWM group had significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances than that of non-fWM. In addition, the fWM group had significantly longer sleep latency, shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency and worse daytime function according to the scores of components of PSQI. Change of work environment may underpin the severer sleep disturbances of fMW. With the direct contact with COVID-19 patients, fMW are inclined to emerge anxiety and worries of being infected. The rapid spread of COVID-19 boomed the medical demands, aggravated the shortage of medical resources and increased work stress for fMW, especially for those with continuous working and frequent day-night shifts. And in terms of factors influencing sleep quality, severity of COVID-19, frequent work shifts and work stress were the leading factors according to our study. We further found anxiety, depression were significantly correlated with PSQI and AIS in fMV, which indicated that anxious and depressive symptoms may influence sleep quality of fMW. The result was consistent with previous studies demonstrating that anxiety and depression played a key role in the development of sleep disturbances [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. This would provide evidence for further targeted interventions to improve sleep disturbances in fMW. However, with the import of supportive fMW from other regions of China, the work duration of fMW may be decreased. By comparison, the non-fMW worked in a relatively mild environment and had less possibility of being infected, thus having less sleep disturbances. Our study also found that scores of PSQI among female fMW were significantly higher than that of male fMW although other scores showed no significant difference, which indicated that female fMW had worse sleep quality than male fMW in emergent events of public health. It is in accordance with previous studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]. In a meta-analysis, Zhang et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. calculated a hazard ratio of 1.41 for female versus male toward insomnia. In general, females had inferior symptom bearing and more bodily vigilance, and the social culture encouraged females to express the indisposition more [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>], which potentially exaggerated the severity and prevalence of sleep disturbances. In addition, females tended to report more sleep problems even if having a similar degree of morning awakening compared to males [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>].<br/><br/>Our study has several limitations that should be noted. First, this is a cross-sectional study. All subjects were volunteered to participate in our survey, so there may be subject selection bias. Second, there are other occupations who directly expose to COVID-19 patients and experience sleep disturbances potentially, such as police and social workers, but our study merely included the medical workers. Third, our questionnaires did not contain sufficient items, such as the potential risk factors for sleep disturbances of fMW, which can provide more information and be used to explore the underlying mechanisms. Forth, our study lacked of interventions and follow-ups, which may show the following changes of sleep disturbances for fMW ."

The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (a) age older than 18 years old; (b) medical workers from hospitals in Hubei Province, including local medical workers and supportive medical workers from other Chinese regions; (c) involved in the battle with COVID-19 directly or/and indirectly, and (d) volunteered to participate in the survey. The exclusion criteria were listed as follows: (a) has been diagnosed as sleep disturbances; (b) sleep quality was affected by physical or psychological diseases; (c) sleep quality was affected by negative personal events; (d) within the treatment course for mental or/and physical diseases and (d) incomplete data of the online questionnaires.",
            "The online survey was conducted in February 2020 among medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, with the contents encompassing basic information (age, gender, marriage, education level and etc.), epidemiological investigation, details of work, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens",
            "Insomnia Scale (AIS) ,Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the factors influencing sleep quality, ect. PSQI is a self-reported questionnaire which assesses subjective sleep quality within one month. It comprises of seven components, including sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, sleep medication and daytime function. A subject with total score > 7 points is defined as poor sleep quality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. In general, the higher the PSQI, the worse the sleep quality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. AIS is a brief instrument to assess the severity of insomnia. It contains eight items with each item rated from 0 to 3 points. The sum of eight items\u2019 scores is regarded as total score. A subject with total score > 6 points is diagnosed as insomnia. In general, the higher the AIS, the severer the insomnia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. A 10-items VAS measure was used to investigate emotional status of subjects, including work pressure, attention, anxiety, energy, confidence, irritability, stress, impatience, fear and depression. The VAS was conducted online as a horizontal graphic slider, which was divided into ten segments from 1 (weakest) to 10 (strongest). The VAS scores could represent the degree of their feelings. Higher scores indicate stronger feeling of each emotional state. We used scores of VAS to compare anxiety and depression between fMW and non-fMW.",
            "The sleep disturbances were mainly confirmed by the scores of PSQI and AIS, with PSQI > 7 points or/and AIS > 6 points. The main study objective was to compare the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression between fMW group and non-fMW group. In addition, we compared the prevalence of sleep disturbances in two groups, aiming to reflect the overall level of sleep quality for medical workers in different work environments.",
            "Categorical variables were described as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were described as the mean \u00b1 SDs. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 for Windows (IBM, Somers, NY). The demographic characteristics were compared by non-parametric test for continuous variables and by Pearson\u2019s chi-square test for categorical variables between two groups. The scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS were compared by ANOVA. The variables with significant differences between two groups in demographic characteristics were described as covariants and joined in the process of ANOVA. In the subgroup analysis of fMW, the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS were compared by ANOVA between male and female fMW. A P-value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance in all statistical analyses. Partial correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the correlation between PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression."

        "Discussion": [
            "The outbreak of COVID-19 in China has aroused extensive public concern in recent months [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Many countries are also experiencing the invasion of COVID-19, such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, Iran, etc [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. The rapid spread of the disease and inadequate early realization toward COVID-19 challenged the healthy institutions in many countries. In addition, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2.3%, and medical workers accounted for 3.8% in COVID-19 patients, as reported by the latest epidemiological study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Previous studies have indicated that in ordinary times, medical workers were vulnerable to sleep disturbances, which may be higher than the general population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that fMW under the outbreak of COVID-19 in China may be more susceptible to sleep disturbances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the sleep disturbances of fMW under the outbreak of COVID-19.",
            "Although sleep disturbances distribute widely among the population, the prevalence varies among different occupations and work pressure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. A USA National Health Interview Survey showed short sleep duration disturbed 29.9% of civilian employed workers, including 40.5% of enterprise managers, 37.1% of transportation/warehousing and 34.8% of manufacturing, and indicated that sleep disturbances have increased over the past decades [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Similarly, a nationwide study in China demonstrated that civil servants had the shortest sleep duration (Mean 7.85 hours) and the worst sleep equality, who may experience with more work pressure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Meanwhile, 64.1% of police officers had PSQI > 5 points, and were regarded as sleep disturbances as reported. Their sleep disturbances were related to posttraumatic stress and general psychopathology [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. A survey from Japan indicated that high occupational stress was significantly associated with insomnia, especially the presence of high efforts but low reward [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. And exposure to long working hours and irregular work shifts may attribute to stress, fatigue and chronic diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], which may influence the quantity and quality of sleep [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Schiller et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] compared sleep quality and sleep duration between full worktime subjects and 75% reduced worktime subjects, and found the latter presented with improved sleep quality and sleep duration. The reduction of worktime may be useful for alleviating sleep disturbances.",
            "Accompanied with long working hours, frequent day-night shifts, excessive workload and high stress, medical workers were vulnerable to sleep disturbances or sleep deprivation all over the world [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. Pikovsky et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. found that 63% and 49% of medical residents presented with low professional performance and judgement levels after the night shifts, respectively. The long working hours could potentially increase the fatigue of medical workers and be linked to the occurrence of medical errors [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. Meanwhile, sleep deprivation could influence the medical workers in making quick and appropriate decisions for patients, which was fatal to patient care [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. Deng et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. reported that job difficulty, doctor-patient relationship, psychosomatic state, environment or events, promotion or competition and total pressure scores were related to sleep disturbances for community nurses. Tucker et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. found moderate work time control for medical workers could improve the sleep quantity that frequent nigh work resulted in, and work time control had association with fewer sleep disturbances. Therefore, it is rational to believe that increased work stress plays a critical role in sleep disturbances of medical workers. With the booming of Chinese economy in past decades, patient visits per physician in China increased by 135% and inpatient admissions per physician rose by 184%. Workload has increased dramatically for Chinese physicians, which exerted a trend that potentially threatened physicians\u2019 health and quality of patient care [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. The prevalence of sleep disturbances in Chinese medical workers was 12.9%-78% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. The present study showed that over 50% of fMW under the outbreak of COVID-19 had sleep disturbances. Although it is even higher than that of in normal times, the prevalence is still compatible to previous results from China. The high prevalence of sleep disturbances of fMW in battle with COVID-19 should be put much emphasize. It was reported that sleep characteristics may exert critical effects on immune functions, which may increase the inflammatory response to sleep deprivation and exert negative feedback to aggravate the short sleep duration and increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disorders [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. Thus, sleep disturbances would further increase the possibility of fMW being infected with COVID-19 owing to affected immune system. Therefore, it is imperative to concern on sleep disturbances of fMW, aiming to maintain their healthy condition and guarantee their professional performance in the battle with COVID-19.",
            "Our study showed that the overall scores of PSQI and AIS for fWM were significantly higher than that of non-fWM, which indicated fMW had worse sleep compared to non-fMW. There were 67.2% and 51.7% of fMW with PSQI > 7 points and AIS > 6 points, respectively, which were regarded as having sleep disturbances. Our study also demonstrated that the fWM group had significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances than that of non-fWM. In addition, the fWM group had significantly longer sleep latency, shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency and worse daytime function according to the scores of components of PSQI. Change of work environment may underpin the severer sleep disturbances of fMW. With the direct contact with COVID-19 patients, fMW are inclined to emerge anxiety and worries of being infected. The rapid spread of COVID-19 boomed the medical demands, aggravated the shortage of medical resources and increased work stress for fMW, especially for those with continuous working and frequent day-night shifts. And in terms of factors influencing sleep quality, severity of COVID-19, frequent work shifts and work stress were the leading factors according to our study. We further found anxiety, depression were significantly correlated with PSQI and AIS in fMV, which indicated that anxious and depressive symptoms may influence sleep quality of fMW. The result was consistent with previous studies demonstrating that anxiety and depression played a key role in the development of sleep disturbances [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. This would provide evidence for further targeted interventions to improve sleep disturbances in fMW. However, with the import of supportive fMW from other regions of China, the work duration of fMW may be decreased. By comparison, the non-fMW worked in a relatively mild environment and had less possibility of being infected, thus having less sleep disturbances. Our study also found that scores of PSQI among female fMW were significantly higher than that of male fMW although other scores showed no significant difference, which indicated that female fMW had worse sleep quality than male fMW in emergent events of public health. It is in accordance with previous studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]. In a meta-analysis, Zhang et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. calculated a hazard ratio of 1.41 for female versus male toward insomnia. In general, females had inferior symptom bearing and more bodily vigilance, and the social culture encouraged females to express the indisposition more [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>], which potentially exaggerated the severity and prevalence of sleep disturbances. In addition, females tended to report more sleep problems even if having a similar degree of morning awakening compared to males [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>].",
            "Our study has several limitations that should be noted. First, this is a cross-sectional study. All subjects were volunteered to participate in our survey, so there may be subject selection bias. Second, there are other occupations who directly expose to COVID-19 patients and experience sleep disturbances potentially, such as police and social workers, but our study merely included the medical workers. Third, our questionnaires did not contain sufficient items, such as the potential risk factors for sleep disturbances of fMW, which can provide more information and be used to explore the underlying mechanisms. Forth, our study lacked of interventions and follow-ups, which may show the following changes of sleep disturbances for fMW ."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "In conclusion, our study showed that over half of the fMW had sleep disturbances in the outbreak of COVID-19. fMW had higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-fMW. And female fMW showed severer sleep disturbances compared to male fMW. Further interventions should be administrated for fMW, aiming to maintain their healthy condition and guarantee their professional performance in the battle with COVID-19. However, further prospective randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate our results.",
