        "abstract": "Background\nThe 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has been spreading rapidly in China. Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19.\n\nFindings\nBefore the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility.\n\nInterpretation\nCOVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.",

Although the number of cases outside of China remains small, mathematical modeling has identified the risk of spread of the disease to population centres and transit hubs in other countries,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] with the possibility that the COVID-19 outbreak could become a global pandemic.<br/><br/>In the beginning stages of an epidemic, mathematical modeling is essential to understand the dynamics of the new disease, and to assess the organism\u2019s infectiousness and rapidity of spread.

            "This study estimated the basic reproduction number,  \", for the 2019 novel coronavirus using confirmed cases from 10th January \u2013 8th February. We applied five methods to estimate  \" in order to ensure that our estimate was robust to differences in assumptions about epidemic processes, differences in assumed underlying parameters, and about the nature of the dynamics of the affected population. We estimated the basic reproduction number for the whole period to be 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09 \u2013 3.70), a very high number indicative of a very fast rate of spread. We also estimated the basic reproduction number separately for the pre-closure period, finding that in the first 13 days of available high-quality data on the epidemic that the basic reproduction number was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63 \u2013 5.13), a very high number indicative of a highly infectious disease. Compared to this, we calculated the postclosure value of  \" to be 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16 \u2013 3.65), still a very high number but significantly lower than that observed in the earlier days of the epidemic. This lower basic reproduction number, and the recent apparent reduction in numbers of new infections, justifies the decision to close Wuhan city, and also shows the potentially high impact of self-quarantine and voluntary exclusion methods. A separate study (not published) conducted by one of the study authors found that 25% of students in Guangdong did not leave their home in the Chinese New Year period, 90% increased their handwashing frequency, and over 80% used a mask when moving in public places. These voluntary measures, combined with the closure of Wuhan city, may have averted the spread of this disease and reduced its ability to reproduce through social changes. The reduction in infectiousness is particularly striking given the huge movement of people that typically occurs during Chinese New Year, and the risk of exposure in public transport and family gatherings at this time."

Ours is also the first study to compare the pre- and post-closure periods in the data, and thus the first study to make a judgment about the effectiveness of this strategy.

            "This study has several limitations. It was based on confirmed cases, and by excluding suspected cases or mild cases may have under-estimated the rate of spread of the disease. We did not estimate the values of the parameters defining the transition rate from exposed to infectious, or infected to recovered, but fixed them at previously published values. This was a necessary decision because the clinical features of the disease are not yet fully understood, and may affect estimates. However, our intuition after fitting these models is that the maximum likelihood estimate of the force of infection naturally adjusts to fit the value of the recovery rate, and produces a broadly similar value of the basic reproduction number as a result. Furthermore, to adjust for the still-arbitrary nature of these estimates of key parameters, we used some methods that do not depend on any assumptions about these aspects of the disease process. Another limitation of this study is the uncertainty introduced by the use of multiple modeling methods, which we combined with a weighted average. However, we believe that by presenting varying methods with different assumptions along with a weighted average, we enable researchers and policy-makers to make judgements about the dangers of the epidemic without relying on any particular set of assumptions about a disease that is not yet well understood."

            "Data was obtained from the NHC for the period 10th January to 8th February, 2020. The NHC is a cabinet-level executive department under the State Council of China which is responsible for public health, medical services and health emergencies in China. Data from before the 10th January was not included in this analysis because cases identified before 10th January were based on symptomatic diagnosis and no standardized testing method was available. Although the NHC provides information on suspected and confirmed cases, only data from confirmed cases was used in this analysis, to avoid confusion of routine seasonal influenza cases with nCoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]",
            "Confirmed cases were analysed using by applying four different estimation techniques, to allow for different assumptions about epidemic growth and the epidemiology of the disease:",
            "\u2022 Exponential growth (EG), which assumes an exponential growth curve to the virus and estimates the basic reproduction number from the Lotka-Euler equation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]",
            "\u2022 Maximum likelihood method (ML), in which the likelihood of the cases is expressed directly in terms of  \" on the assumption of a simple SIR model structure[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]",
            "\u2022 Sequential Bayesian Method (SB), in which the posterior probability distribution of the basic reproduction number is estimated sequentially using the posterior at the previous time point as the new prior[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]",
            "\u2022 Time-dependent reproduction numbers (TD), in which the basic reproduction number at any time point is estimated as an average of accumulated estimates at previous time points[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]",
            "These methods were implemented using the R0 package in R.18 All these models require no assumption about recovery time, but in some cases require an assumption about the generation time of the epidemic. All methods were applied to the data for the whole period (January 10th to February 8th), to the period only before the closure (January 10th to January 23rd), and to only the period after the closure of Wuhan city (January 23rd to February 8th)",
            "Because some of these methods are driven by a Suceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, but an asymptomatic latent phase had been identified in the early progress of the disease, we also estimated the basic reproduction number using a standard SusceptibleExposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. An analytic expression for the basic reproduction number was obtained from the model using next generation matrices,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and predictions of cumulative cases were fitted to the data on national cases using maximum likelihood estimation to identify the optimal value of  \".20 A Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo sampling method[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] was used to estimate a credible interval for the basic reproduction number. In this model the latent phase was fixed to last 5.2 days,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] and the recovery period was fixed at 7 days. Although the biological recovery period of the disease has not been clearly established, the period from onset of symptoms to isolation in specialist hospitals was assumed to be 7 days, and the recovery compartment of the SEIR model acts as a proxy for isolation in these models. All MH estimates used 20,000 Monte Carlo Iterations with a burn-in period of 5,000 iterations and a normally distributed proposal distribution.",
            "Because all five modeling methods use different assumptions and tools and are likely to produce widely varying estimates of the basic reproduction number based on different aspects of the epidemic process, we combined all five estimates to produce an overall value for the basic reproduction number. We calculated a weighted average of the five basic reproduction numbers by calculating weights from a Poisson loss function,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] which is similar to a Poisson likelihood but which was not used for estimation of parameters in any of the models. We also estimated a weighted standard error from the models. Where standard errors do not overlap point estimates in the pre- and post-closure periods, we conclude there is a significant difference in the epidemic process between the periods. Finally, we estimated the predicted epidemic trend from all models in each period, and plotted these against the observed number of cases for each period.",

            "A striking feature of our analysis is the very high value of the basic reproduction number we identified in the period of time up to the closure of Wuhan city. Three of our modeling methods \u2013 including the best-fitting method based on a Poisson loss function \u2013 identified a value of  \" greater than 5, with some possibility of a value over 6. Basic reproduction numbers in the 5-7 range are consistent with extremely contagious diseases such as mumps and smallpox, and indicate a disease with a very high risk of becoming a global pandemic. This finding has significant implications for cities like Singapore, Japan and London which are beginning to experience the first signs of spread of the disease without importation. In light of the epidemic threat identified here, these cities should consider implementing more aggressive prevention policies as necessary, while respecting human rights and the dignity of affected individuals and of those who might be disadvantaged by stricter quarantine and control mechanisms.",

This variation may have arisen for two reasons. First, the empirical data that previous studies used were collected before 25th Jan, 2020. Testing protocols and diagnostic tools changed during the early period of the study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>], and the number of diagnosed cases collected before 15th January were considered underestimated and less reliable. This would flatten the epidemic curve in early studies, and the estimation of R0 based on these data may be underestimated and have larger confidence intervals. Second, previous studies only estimated the R0 based on a single method, and these estimates may have been affected by the implicit assumptions in these models. For example, a previous paper using the assumption of exponential growth found a value of  \" of 2.68 (95% Credible interval 2.47 \u2013 2.86)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] using an SEIR model with Metropolis-Hastings MCMC estimates of uncertainty, but our modeling has shown that this method likely underestimated the basic reproduction number during the pre-closure period.

Ours is also the first study to compare the pre- and post-closure periods in the data, and thus the first study to make a judgment about the effectiveness of this strategy.
