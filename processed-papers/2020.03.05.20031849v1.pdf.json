        "abstract": "15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: \u2265 65 years) and 1 to 5 (i \u2260 j; 1: \u2264 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 46 25-59 years; 4: \u2265 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one 47 published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR). Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups (\u03c72 = 4.99   10-6, P > 0.999), and five age groups (\u03c72 = 4.85   10-6, P > 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 53 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 54 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred 55 from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 56 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 57 0.0002 per 10 million persons). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people. Key words: Transmissibility; Novel coronavirus; Mathematical model; Age-specific dynamics",

            "In December 2019, a series of cases were identified by a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported by Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The disease was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health<br/><br/>Organization in 11 February 2020. The patients may be related to have contacted with Huanan<br/><br/>Seafood Wholesale Market[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], and the virus can continuously transmit from person-to-person with basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 3.9)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Another research estimated that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 (95% CI, 2.47 to 2.86)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].<br/><br/>Age-related transmissibility of COVID-19 has become a public health concern. The reported cases at the early stage (before 2 January 2020) of the transmission were higher than 18 years old and mainly were on 25-64 years old[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. A study with 425 patients indicated that the median age was 59 years (range, 15 to 89) and reported different case distributions in four age groups: 0 \u2013 14, 15 \u2013 44, 45<br/><br/>\u2013 64, and   65 years[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. However, there is not enough epidemiological evidence to classify the age groups in transmission. In this study, we added another age classification scenario according to our previous research on influenza that people were divided into five age groups: 0 \u2013 5, 6 \u2013 14, 15 \u2013 24, 25<br/><br/>\u2013 59, and   60 years[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], to better understand the transmissibility of the disease for different ages.<br/><br/>There were several studies focusing on mathematical modelling on COVID-19[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], calculating the<br/><br/>R0 by using the serial intervals and intrinsic growth rate[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], or using ordinary differential equations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. We also developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People (BHRP)<br/><br/>transmission network model and simplified the BHRP model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model to calculate the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. However, there is no age-specific mathematical model for quantifying the age-specific transmissibility SARS-CoV-2.<br/><br/>In this study, based on the RP model which we developed, we built an age-specific susceptible \u2013<br/><br/>exposed \u2013 symptomatic \u2013 asymptomatic \u2013 recovered \u2013 reservoir (SEIARW) model. The age-specific<br/><br/>SEIARW model was employed to estimate the age-specific transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 by fitting the data from 26 November to 23 December, 2019 from published literature[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]."

We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (i \u2260 j; 1: 0 \u2013 years; 2: \u2013 years; 3: \u2013 years; 4: \u2265 years) and 1 to 5 (i \u2260 j; 1: 0 \u2013 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: \u2265 60 years), respectively.<br/><br/>Age-specific transmission model<br/><br/>Our previous study showed that the SEIARW model could be adopted to simulate the infectious diseases transmitted from reservoir (such as water or food) to people and from person to person[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].<br/><br/>In this study, the age-specific SEIARW model was developed based on two transmission routes (form market to person and person to person). In the model, people were divided into five compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic (I), asymptomatic (A), recovered (R), and the seafood market were defined as reservoir (W). The definitions of the six compartments were shown in Table 1.<br/><br/>The model was based on following assumptions: a) Susceptible individuals become infected by contact with infected/asymptomatic people; b) SARS-CoV-2 can transmit within each age group. The transmission rate of age group i and j are \u03b2ii and \u03b2jj respectively.<br/><br/>c) SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between different age groups. The transmission rate from age group i to j is \u03b2ij and from j to i is \u03b2ji.<br/><br/>d) Susceptible people will be infected after contact with seafood market, and the infection rate coefficient is \u03b2w; e) All the newborn individuals which were assumed as susceptible were added into age group 1.<br/><br/>Each age group has a natural mortality rate. We set the natural birth rate is br, and the natural mortality rate is dr; f) The incubation period of exposed person is 1/  . The exposed person will become asymptomatic people after a latent period of 1/  \u2019. We describe p (0 \u2264 p \u2264 1) as the proportion of asymptomatic infection. Exposed individuals will become asymptomatic person A with a daily rate of pE, and become symptomatic person with a daily rate of (1-p)E; h) The individuals I and A will become recovered person (R) after an infectious period of 1/\u03b3 and<br/><br/>1/\u03b3\u2019.

As reported by Xu et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], the median time from exposure to onset of illness (infected) was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days). Another study showed that the mean of incubation period was around 5 days and the period falls within the range of 2-14 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. We set the 5-day as the incubation period and the latent period in this study. Thus,   =  \u2019 = 0.2.<br/><br/>Since there was no data on the proportion of asymptomatic infection of the virus, we simulated the baseline value of proportion of 0.5 (p = 0.5). Since there was no evidence about the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection, we assumed that the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was 0.5 times that of symptomatic infection (   = 0.5), which was the similar value as influenza[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. We assumed that the relative shedding rate of A compared to I was 0.5. Thus, c = 0.5. Since the SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, we assumed that it could be died in the environment in a short time, but it could stay for a longer time (10 days) in the unknown hosts in the market. We set \u03b5 = 0.1.<br/><br/>There is a mean 5-day delay from symptom onset to detection/hospitalization of a case (the cases detected in Thailand and Japan were hospitalized from 3-7 days after onset, respectively) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].<br/><br/>Another study showed that the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. As reported by Xu et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], the median time from onset of illness to first hospital admission was 2 (range from 1-4) days. A study including 45 patients diagnosed before January 1 was estimated to have a mean of 5.8 days (95% CI: 4.3\u20137.5) from illness onset to first medical visit[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. In our model, we set the infectious period of the cases as 6 days. Therefore, \u03b3 = \u03b3\u2019 = 0.1667.<br/><br/>According the official report by National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, we collected the data of daily fatality from January 24 to 30 , 2020[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Therefore, we set f as 0.02348<br/><br/>(range: 0.02198-0.03186). In this study, we set the total population as 11,081,000 so that br = 4.266<br/><br/>and dr = 3.184   10 based on the 2018 Wuhan Statistical Yearbook (Table 2).    th    -5 th<br/><br/>A two-step curve fitting method was adopted to estimate the parameter bW, bii, bjj, bij, and bji. At the first step, we used the mix-age SEIARW model to fit the data and to estimate the parameter bW and mix-age b (named as bp). At the second step, we used the age-specific SEIARW model to fit the data and to estimate the parameter bii, bjj, bij, and bji.<br/><br/>Quantification of the age-specific transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>In the model the age-specific secondary attack rate (SAR) was employed to quantify the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.

In this study, the \u201cknock-out\u201d simulation was defined as cutting off the route of transmission between or within different age groups, and was performed in the following scenarios: A) \u03b2ii = 0; B) \u03b2ji = 0; C) \u03b2ij = 0; D) \u03b2jj = 0; E) control (no cutting off transmission route).<br/><br/>Simulation method and statistical analysis<br/><br/>Berkeley Madonna 8.3.18 (developed by Robert Macey and George Oster of the University of<br/><br/>GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).

            "This is the first study to develop an age-specific SEIARW model to quantify the transmissibility of<br/><br/>COVID-19 among different age groups. The results showed that our model fitted the reported data well, thus has the capability of estimating or predicting? the age-specific transmissibility of the virus.<br/><br/>These results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adult older than 25 years old or elder people, but has low transmissibility among children or people younger than 14 years.<br/><br/>These results were similar to the age-specific transmissibility of influenza A (H1N1)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. The age-specific control and prevention interventions are needed.<br/><br/>The reasons for the difference of age-specific transmissibility remain unclear. It might be related to the different contact characteristics among different age groups. Adults were more likely to work outside and came into contact with different individuals in work places, buses, subways, or even airplanes.<br/><br/>However, children or younger people could stay at home during the outbreak, and they were less likely to get infected, or if they were infected, it was mostly from adults or elder people in the same family.<br/><br/>Our findings were based on the parameter estimation and the data from literatures. It is known that the asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 exists. As reported by Bai et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], 1 of 6 cases was asymptomatic infected, with the proportion of asymptomatic of 0.17. As reported by Pan et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>], 2 of 3 cases was asymptomatic infected, with the proportion of asymptomatic of 0.67.There was a research showed that the asymptomatic infection would shed SARS-CoV-2 for 5 days[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. However, there was not enough evidence to provide the clear epidemiological estimates of the parameters p,  ,  \u2019, and \u03b3\u2019<br/><br/>which were related to asymptomatic characteristics. Although there was clinical evidence to calculate the parameters related to symptomatic cases such as incubation period, fatality rate, and duration from symptoms onset to diagnosis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], more epidemiological data are needed to explore the parameters.<br/><br/>However, we performed a sensitivity analysis of all the nine parameters from the literatures, and we found that the models was slightly sensitive to parameters p,  , and \u03b3 but not sensitive to parameters  , c, \u03b5, f,  \u2019, and \u03b3\u2019. Therefore, our results might be affected slightly by the parameter estimation.<br/><br/>Since we could not obtain the first-hand data, the results of our findings might have some uncertainties. However, our study aimed to develop and provide an age-specific transmission model for the public health department who has the big data to investigate the age-specific transmissibility in real world scenarios."
