        "abstract": "Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Zika and highly pathogenic influenza present a major threat to public health[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Despite intense research effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12nd 2019. Epidemiological investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 26th 2019. Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] identified a novel RNA virus from the family Coronaviridae designed WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that WHCV was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history of genomic recombination. This outbreak highlights the ongoing capacity of viral spill[45] over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.",

            "Cases and collection of clinical data and samples<br/><br/>Patients presenting with acute onset of fever (>37.5\u00b0C), cough, and chest tightness, and who were admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital in Wuhan city, China, were considered as suspected cases. During admission, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected and stored at -<br/><br/>80\u00b0C until further processing. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from the clinical records of the confirmed patients. The study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br/><br/>RNA library construction and sequencing<br/><br/>Total RNA was extracted from the BALF sample of patient 1 using the RNeasy Plus<br/><br/>Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The quantity and quality of the RNA solution was assessed using a Qbit machine and an Agilent 2100<br/><br/>Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) before library construction and sequencing. An RNA library was then constructed using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion was performed during library construction following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Paired-end (150 bp) sequencing of the RNA library was performed on the MiniSeq platform (Illumina). Library preparation and sequencing were carried out at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.<br/><br/>Data processing and viral agent identification<br/><br/>Sequencing reads were first adaptor- and quality-trimmed using the Trimmomatic program[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].<br/><br/>The remaining reads (56,565,928 reads) were assembled de novo using both the Megahit (version 1.1.3)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] and Trinity program (version 2.5.1)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] with default parameter settings. Megahit generated a total of 384,096 assembled contigs (size range: 200-30,474 nt), while Trinity generated 1,329,960 contigs with a size range of 201 to 11,760 nt. All of these assembled contigs were compared (using blastn and Diamond blastx) against the entire non-redundant nucleotide (Nt) and protein (Nr) database, with e-values set to 1\u00d710-10 and 1\u00d710-5, respectively. To identify possible aetiologic agents present in the sequence data, the abundance of the assembled contigs was first evaluated as the expected counts using the<br/><br/>RSEM program[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] implemented in Trinity. Non-human reads (23,712,657 reads), generated by filtering host reads using the human genome (human release 32, GRCh38.p13, downloaded from Gencode) by Bowtie[229], were used for the RSEM abundance assessment.<br/><br/>As the longest contigs generated by Megahit (30,474 nt) and Trinity (11,760 nt) both had high similarity to the bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 and were at high abundance (Table S1 and S2), the longer one (30,474 nt) that covered almost the whole virus genome was used for primer design for PCR confirmation and genome termini determination. Primers used in PCR, qPCR and RACE experiments are listed in Table S8. The<br/><br/>PCR assay was conducted as described previously[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and the complete genome termini was determined using the Takara SMARTer RACE 5'/3' kit (TaKaRa) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Subsequently, the genome coverage and sequencing depth were determined by remapping all of the adaptor- and quality-trimmed reads to the whole genome of WHCV using Bowtie[229] and Samtools[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>].<br/><br/>The viral loads of WHCV in BALF of patient 1 were determined by quantitative realtime RT-PCR with Takara One Step PrimeScriptTM RT-PCR Kit (Takara RR064A) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using 2.5\u03bcl RNA with<br/><br/>8pmol of each primer and 4pmol probe under the following conditions: reverse transcription at 42oC for 10 minutes, and 95oC for 1 minute, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 1 minute. The reactions were performed and detected by ABI 7500 Real-Time<br/><br/>PCR Systems. PCR product covering the Taqman primers and probe region was cloned into pLB vector using the Lethal Based Simple Fast Cloning Kit (TIAGEN) as standards for quantitative viral load test.<br/><br/>Virus genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis<br/><br/>For the newly identified virus genome, the potential open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted and annotated using the conserved signatures of the cleavage sites recognized by coronavirus proteinases, and were processed in the Lasergene software package (version 7.1, DNAstar). The viral genes were aligned using the L-INS-i algorithm implemented in MAFFT (version 7.407)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>].<br/><br/>Phylogenetic analyses were then performed using the nucleotide sequences of various<br/><br/>CoV gene data sets: (i) Whole genome, (ii) ORF1a, (iii) ORF1b, (iv) nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] (3CLpro), (v)<br/><br/>RdRp (nsp12), (vi) nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] (Hel), (vii) nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] (ExoN), (viii) nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] (NendoU), (ix) nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] (O-<br/><br/>MT), (x) spike (S), and the (xi) nucleocapsid (N). Phylogenetic trees were inferred using the<br/><br/>Maximum likelihood (ML) method implemented in the PhyML program (version 3.0)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>], using the Generalised Time Reversible substitution (GTR) model and Subtree Pruning and<br/><br/>Regrafting (SPR) branch-swapping. Bootstrap support values were calculated from 1,000 pseudo-replicate trees. The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution was determined using<br/><br/>MEGA (version 5)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>].

Despite intense research effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12nd 2019. Epidemiological investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan.

Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans revealed bilateral focal consolidation, lobar consolidation and patchy consolidation, especially in the lower lung. A chest radiograph revealed a bilateral diffuse patchy and fuzzy shadow on day 5 after admission (day 11 after the onset of illness).

In all phylogenies WHCV clustered with members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, including the SARS-CoV responsible for the global SARS pandemic of 2002-20031,2, as well as a number of SARS-like coronaviruses sampled from bats. However, WHCV changed topological position within the subgenus Sarbecovirus depending on which gene was used, suggestive of a past history of recombination in this group of viruses (Figures 3 and S4).
