We employed a Bayesian framework to infer the time-calibrated phylogeny and the epidemic dynamics represented by the effective reproductive number (Re) changing over time from the genomic sequences available from GISAID. The origin time is estimated to be December 17, 2019 (95% CI: December 5, 2019 \u2013 December 23, 2019). Re changes drastically over time, with highest value of 2.5 (0.5, 4.9) and lowest value of 0.3 (0.006, 1.47) (median and 95% highest posterior density interval). This study provides an early insight of the 2019-nCoV epidemic.",

            "An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, a city in central    China<br/><br/>Coronaviruses cause diseases range from common cold to severe pneumonia. Two fatal (WHO; https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china).<br/><br/>coronavirus epidemics over the last two decades were severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (WHO; https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus). Human to human transmission has been confirmed for this new type of coronavirus (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2020_a\">Wang et al 2020</a>) and more than 1,000 cases have been reported as of January 25, 2020 (https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/01/the-latestcoronavirus-cases).<br/><br/>Studying the virus epidemic dynamics is crucial for further surveillance and control of the outbreak. Phylogeny of the viruses is a proxy of the transmission chain. Early studies of 2019-<br/><br/>nCoV have focused on their molecular features and phylogenetic relationship with the close relatives (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2020_a\">Zhou et al 2020</a>; Chan et al 2020). The phylogenetic analyses typically ignored the sampling times and measursed branch lengths by expected number of substitutioins per site.<br/><br/>They are also lacking a stochastic process to model the epidemic dynamics over time. However, both the timing and dynamics are critical to understand the early outbreak of 2019-nCoV.<br/><br/>Furthermore, various sources of information and uncertainties are hard to be integrated in the analyses without employing a Bayesian approach.<br/><br/>In this study, we used the birth-death skyline serial (BDSS) model (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cStadler_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rStadler_et+al_2013_a\">Stadler et al 2013</a>) to infer the phylogeny, divergence times and epidemic dynamics of 2019-nCoV. This approach takes the genomic sequences and sampling times of the viruses as input, and co-estimtes the phylogeny and key epidemic parameters in a Bayesian framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform such estimation on 2019-nCoV."

            "<strong>Results and Discussion</strong><br/><br/>The phylogeny in Figure 1 shows the divergence times and relationships of the 24<br/><br/>BetaCoV viruses. The samples from Wuhan form a paraphyletic group, while the rest of the samples form a monophyletic clade. These two clades are not divergent from each other as their sequences are quite similar, which indicates that the outbreak is still in an early stage. The patients from Guangdong and Zhejiang had traveled from Wuhan and they had been infected before travelling (Chan et al 2020). Note that this phylogeny is a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree summarized from the posterior samples, which represents a best estimate of the author/funder. It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.<br/><br/>topology. The probabilities in most clades are lower than 0.5 and would form polytomies if summarized (https://www.gisaid.org).<br/><br/>as a majority-rule consensus tree as shown in    GISAID<br/><br/>The time of origin is estimated with median 31.9 days and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval from 26.3 to 43.8 days before the date of the latest sample (January 18, 2020), that is, December 17, 2019 (December 5, 2019 to December 23, 2019) (Table 1). This is on average https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china), showing again an early phase of the epidemic.<br/><br/>days before the cluster was initially reported (WHO, The effective reproductive number (Re) changing over time represents the epidemic dynamics of 2019-nCoV (Figure 2). Re is defined as the number of expected secondary infections caused by an infected individual during the epidemic (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cStadler_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rStadler_et+al_2013_a\">Stadler et al 2013</a>). Thus, Re ><br/><br/>1.0 means that the number of cases are increasing and the epidemic is growing, whereas Re <<br/><br/>1.0 means that the epidemic is declining and will die out. Interestingly, the epidemic has an early boost before December 31 with Re at around 2.0, and the number increases to over 2.5 from January 13 to 15, 2020. This is in agreement with some other studies reporting Re between<br/><br/>3.3 and 5.5 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRead_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rRead_et+al_2020_a\">Read et al 2020</a>; Zhao et al 2020). In comparison, the estimated Re was 2.7 to 3.6 for SARS during the precontrol phase in HongKong (Riley et al 2003). Re is not consistenly larger than 1.0 as we also observe decreased values between January 1 to 10 and in the last three days. However, this is likely an artifact of lacking samples in these time intervals. Keep in mind that we used only 24 samples in our analysis, which is less than 2% of the reported number of infected patients. With more viurses sequenced, we would expect more reliable estimates which would provide better insights into the epidemic of 2019-nCoV.<br/><br/>Overall, this study provides an early insight of the 2019-nCoV epidemic by inferring key epidemiological parameters from the virus sequences. Such estimates would help public health officials to coordinate effectively to control the outbreak."

            "The original data downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) consists of 26 sequences of 2019-nCoV (as of January 24, 2020). We excluded two outliers, one is the virus from Kanagawa, Japan (EPI_ISL_402126) which contained only a small segment of 369bp, another is from Wuhan, China (EPI_ISL_403928) which contains suspiciously many mutations and has genetic distance about ten times longer than the rest of the sequences (GISAID; https://www.gisaid.org). Sequence alignment was done using MUSCLE<br/><br/>{Edgar:2004bo}, resulting in a total length of 29904bp for the whole genome. The sampling times of the viruses ranged from December 24, 2019 (EPI_ISL_402123) to January 18, 2020<br/><br/>(EPI_ISL_403937) and they were used as fixed ages (in unit of years) in subsequent analysis.<br/><br/>We used the BDSS model (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cStadler_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rStadler_et+al_2013_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cStadler_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rStadler_et+al_2013_a\">Stadler et al 2013</a></a>) implemented in the BDSKY package for<br/><br/>BEAST 2 (Bouckaert et al 2019) to infer the phylogeny, divergence times and epidemic dynamics of 2019-nCoV. The model has an important epidemiological parameter, the effective reproductive number Re, defined as the number of expected secondary infections caused by an infected individual during the epidemic. The model allows Re to change over time, making it feasible to estimate its dynamics (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cStadler_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rStadler_et+al_2013_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cStadler_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rStadler_et+al_2013_a\">Stadler et al 2013</a></a>). The other two parameters are the becoming noninfectious rate \u03b4 and sampling proportion p, which were assumed constant over time. For the priors, Re was assigned a lognormal(0, 1.25) distribution with median 1.0 and 95%<br/><br/>quantiles between 0.13 and 7.82. \u03b4 was given a lognormal (2, 1.25) distribution with median<br/><br/>7.39 and mean 16.1, expecting the infectious period of an individual (1/\u03b4) to be about a month.<br/><br/>The sampling proportion of infected individuals p of was a beta(1, 9) distribution with mean<br/><br/>0.1. The BDSS process starts from the origin time t0, which was assigned a lognormal(\u20132, 1.5)<br/><br/>distribution with median 0.135 (years before the lasest sampling time). Time from the origin to the lastest sample was divided into ten equally spaced intervals where Re was estimated individually in each interval.<br/><br/>We used the lognormal independent relaxed clock (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDrummond_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rDrummond_et+al_2006_a\">Drummond et al 2006</a>; Rannala and<br/><br/>Yang 2007) to model evolutionary rate variation along the branches. The mean clock rate r was assigned a gamma(2, 0.0005) prior with mean of 0.001 substitutions per site per year and the standard deviation \u03c3 was a gamma (0.54, 0.38) prior with mean 0.2 and median 0.1 by default.<br/><br/>The substitution model used was HKY+\u03934 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHasegawa_et+al_1985_a\" href=\"#rHasegawa_et+al_1985_a\">Hasegawa et al 1985</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_1994_a\" href=\"#rYang_1994_a\">Yang 1994</a>) in which the transition-transversion rate ratio \u03ba was set a lognormal(1, 1.25) prior and the gamma shape parameter \u03b1 was an exponential(1) prior.<br/><br/>The analysis was performed in the BEAST 2 platform (Bouckaert et al 2019). We ran 150 million MCMC iterations and sampled every 5000 iterations. The first 30% samples were discarded as burn-in. Convergence was diagnosed in Tracer (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRambaut_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rRambaut_et+al_2018_a\">Rambaut et al 2018</a>) to confirm that independent runs gave consensus results and all parameters had effective sample size (ESS)<br/><br/>larger than 100. The remaining 70% samples were used to build the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree and to summarize the parameter estimates. The common ancestor heights were used to annotate the clade ages in the MCC tree."

These two clades are not divergent from each other as their sequences are quite similar, which indicates that the outbreak is still in an early stage. The patients from Guangdong and Zhejiang had traveled from Wuhan and they had been infected before travelling (Chan et al 2020). Note that this phylogeny is a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree summarized from the posterior samples, which represents a best estimate of the",
