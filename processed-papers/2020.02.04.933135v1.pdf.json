In this report, we re-analyzed the computational approaches and findings presented in two recent manuscripts by Ji et al (https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25682) and by Pradhan et al (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871), which concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions shared a unique similarity to HIV-1. Results from our re-implementation of the analyses, built on larger-scale datasets using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, do not support the conclusions proposed by these manuscripts. Based on our analyses and existing data of coronaviruses, we concluded that the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV are more likely to be mammals and birds than snakes, and that the \u201cnovel insertions\u201d observed in the spike protein are naturally evolved from bat coronaviruses."

            "2019-nCoV Spike Protein does not Include Insertions Unique to HIV-1 In a recent manuscript entitled \u201cUncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp[120] and Gag\u201d 3, Pradhan et al presented a discovery of four novel insertions unique to 2019-nCoV spike protein (Figure 1). They further concluded that these four insertions are part of the receptor binding site of 2019-nCoV, and that these insertions shared \u201cuncanny similarity\u201d to Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) proteins but not to other coronaviruses. These claims have resulted in considerable controversy in the community. To investigate whether the conclusions by Pradhan et al are scientifically precise, we re-analyzed the structural location and sequence homology of the four spike protein insertions discussed therein.",
            "Since the structure of the spike protein in 2019-nCoV is not yet available, we used C-ITASSER5 to model its tertiary structure, as part of our efforts for full genome structure and function analyses of 2019-nCoV that are available at https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/C-ITASSER/2019-nCov/. The C-I-TASSER model has a reasonable confidence score which corresponds to an estimated TM-score 6 of 0.61. The 2019-nCoV spike model was then",

As shown in Figure 2, all four insertions are located outside the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of spike, in contrast to the original conclusion made by Pradhan et al which stated that the insertions are located on the interface with ACE2.",
            "To investigate viral homologs of the four insertions, we further performed a BLAST sequence search of these four insertions against the non-redundant (NR) sequence database, restricting the search results to viruses (taxid:10239), but leaving other search parameters at default values. The choice of BLAST instead of the more sensitive PSI-BLAST algorithm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] is to emulate the original report by Pradhan et al which mainly aimed to identify near identical sequences. The top 5 sequence homologs (including the query itself) identified for each insertion are listed in Tables 1-4. In contrast to the previous claim that the four insertions are unique to 2019-nCoV and HIV-1, all four insertion fragments can be found in other viruses. In fact, an HIV-1 protein is among the top BLAST hits for only one of the four insertion fragments, while three of the four insertion fragments are found in bat coronavirus RaTG13. Moreover, partly due to the very short length of these insertions, which range from 6 to 8 amino acids, the E-value of the BLAST hits, which is a parameter used by BLAST for assessing the statistical significance of the alignments and usually needs to be below 0.01 to be considered as significant[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], are all greater than 4, except for a bat coronavirus hit for IS2. These high E-values suggest that the majority of these similarities are likely to be coincidental.",
            "Prokaryotic dsDNA virus sp.",
            "Given that 3 out of the 4 insertion fragments are found in the bat coronavirus RaTG13, it is attempting to assume that these \u201cinsertions\u201d may be directly inherited from bat coronaviruses. Currently, there are at least 7 known human coronaviruses (2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, MERSCoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1), where many of them, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), were shown to be transmitted from bat[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] (Figure 3A). To further examine the evolutionary relationship between the 2019nCoV genome and the bat coronavirus, in comparison with other human coronaviruses, in Figure 3B we created by MUSCLE a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for all the 7 human coronaviruses and the bat coronavirus RaTG13 that is currently known to be the closest relative to 2019-nCoV14 among known coronaviruses. Among the 4 \u201cinsertions\u201d of the 2019-nCoV, IS1 has only 1 residue different from the bat coronavirus, and 3 out of 7 residues are identical with MERS-CoV. IS2 and IS3 are all identical to the bat coronavirus. For IS4, although the local sequence alignment by BLAST did not hit the bat coronavirus in Table 4, it has a close evolutionary relation with the bat coronavirus in the MSA. In particular, the first 6 residues in the IS4 fragment \u201cQTQTNSPRRA\u201d from 2019-nCoV are identical to the bat CoV, while the last 4 residues, which were absent in the bat coronavirus or SARS-CoV, have at least 50% identity to MERS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1.",
            "Putting these together, we believe that there is a close evolutionary relation between 2019nCoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13. The four insertions highlighted by Pradhan et al in the spike protein are not unique to 2019-nCoV and HIV-1. In fact, they are shared with many other viruses including the bat coronavirus. Yes, the similarities in the sequence-based alignments built on these very short fragments are statistically insignificant, as assessed by the BLAST E-values. Structurally, these \u201cinsertions\u201d are far away from the binding interface of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor, as shown in Figure 2, which are also contradictory with the conclusion made by Pradhan et al.",
            "Another early study attempting to understanding the infection of 2019-nCoV was performed by Ji et al 4. In this study, the authors analyzed the Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) of 2019-nCoV and 8 vertebrates, including two species of snakes (Bungarus multicinctus and Naja atra), hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), marmot (Marmota), pangolin (manis javanica), chicken (Gallus gallus), and human (Homo sapiens). Among these vertebrates, snakes have the smallest codon usage difference (squared Euclidiean distance of RSCU) from 2019-nCoV and were therefore proposed by Ji et al as the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV. This conclusion is controversial among virologists, mainly due to the lack of prior biological evidence that coronavirus can infect animals other than mammals and birds 15. In this report, we further scrutinize the bioinformatics approach and the underlying biological assumptions by a large-scale replication of the RSCU analysis.",
            "The bioinformatics analysis performed in Ji et al study has several limitations. First, there are only approximately 300 protein coding sequences (CDSs) in the NCBI GenBank for the snake species they chose from Bungarus multicinctus and Naja atra. These CDSs represent <2% of all protein coding genes in a typical snake genome; the genome of King cobra (Naja hannah), for example, encodes 18,387 proteins according to UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000018936). The limited numbers of known CDSs in Bungarus multicinctus and Naja atra mean that the RSCU statistics may not reflect the actual RSCU distribution in the whole genome. Second, the Codon Usage Database used in the analysis of Ji et al has not been updated since 2007; a re-analysis using more recent codon usage database such as CoCoPUTs is needed. Third, only 8 vertebrates were analyzed in their study, while there are >100,000 vertebrates with at least one CDS in the NCBI GenBank database. Finally, there is no established evidence that viruses evolve their codon usage to resemble that of their animal hosts 16; this calls for a careful benchmark of RSCU analysis in terms of its ability to re-discover known hosts of characterized viruses.",
            "To address these issues, we re-implemented the RSCU comparison algorithm proposed by Ji et al to analyze the codon usage in the 2019-nCoV genome (NCBI accession MN908947.3) and those of all 102,367 vertebrate species in the CoCoPUTS database. To test whether this kind of analysis can recover known hosts of well-studied coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV, NCBI accession NC_004718) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV, NCBI accession NC_019843) are also included. Codon usage frequency are converted to squared Euclidean distance of RSCU in two separate analyses: one based on all vertebrates (Figure 4A-C) and the other on the subset of vertebrates with enough statistics, i.e. >2000 known CDSs (Figure 4D-F), roughly corresponding to 10% of all protein coding genes in a typical vertebrate genome.",
            "As shown in Figure 4, the top-ranking vertebrates with lowest RSCU distances to the three different coronavirus are very similar. For example, for all three viruses, two kinds of frogs (Megophrys feae and Liophryne schlaginhaufeni) have the smallest RSCU distances among all vertebrates, while another two kinds of frogs (Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis) have the smallest RSCU distances among all vertebrates with sufficient sequences. In fact, the RSCU distances between coronaviruses and frogs are consistently smaller than that between coronaviruses and the two snakes (Bungarus multicinctus and Naja atra) analyzed in Ji et al, as shown in Table 5.",
            "Table 5 also showed that the RSCU analysis cannot identify the known natural, intermediate, and eventual hosts (Rhinolophus sinicus, Paguma larvata, and Homo sapiens) of SARS-CoV or the hosts (Camelus dromedarius and Homo sapiens) of MERS-CoV, as the RSCU distances of these vertebrates are all larger than the cold blooded vertebrates (frogs and snakes). In fact, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the two coronaviruses known to utilize different intermediate hosts (Paguma larvata and Camelus dromedarius), have almost no difference in RSCU. These data suggest that the RSCU analysis proposed by Ji et al cannot provide conclusive evidence for the natural, intermediate or eventual hosts of coronavirus. Based on our current knowledge of existing zoonotic coronaviruses 15, we conceive that, if 2019-nCoV requires an intermediate host, this host is more likely to be a warm-blooded vertebrate (a mammal or a bird), than snakes.",
