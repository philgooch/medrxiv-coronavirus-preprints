        "abstract": "The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.",

Initially, these infections were thought to result from zoonotic (animal-to-human) transmission; however, recently published evidence [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and the exponential growth of case incidences show compelling evidence of human-to-human secondary transmission fueled by travel, with many cases detected in other parts of the world [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].

We thus estimated the incubation period by (i) excluding Wuhan residents and (ii) including Wuhan residents. The former may be more precise in defining the interval of exposure, but the sample size is greater for the latter.

            "The present study advances the public discussion on COVID-19 infections by presenting explicit estimations of the incubation period and other epidemiologic characteristics using publicly available data. Our estimated mean incubation period of approximately 5 days is comparable to known mean values of the incubation period for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], as well as other recent estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. In addition to empirically showing the comparability of COVID-19 to other disease-causing coronaviruses, the present study has also shown that the 95th percentile of the incubation period is around 10\u201314 days, indicating that a 14-day quarantine period would largely ensure the absence of disease among healthy    95th percentile    50th percentile<br/><br/>5th percentile exposed individuals. Wuhan residents have a less precisely defined exposure period compared to travelers and secondary cases from known human to human transmission events. However, our calculations have shown that adding more cases to the dataset even with uncertainty reduces both the variance of the estimates and selection bias, improving the fit of the distribution mean. Our estimates are in agreement with the report of Li et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. A recent study by Backer et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] noted a similar finding in their analysis of the incubation period for 88 cases (including 63 Wuhan residents). However, the estimates of Backer et al for the model that included Wuhan residents were subject to overestimation as the lower bounds for Wuhan residents\u2013who had unknown left exposure dates\u2013were fixed in their analysis. In contrast, we considered the left exposure dates for Wuhan residents as parameters to be fitted\u2014see [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] for details.

            "The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2\u201314 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3\u20134 days without truncation and at 5\u20139 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.",

            "exposed individuals. Wuhan residents have a less precisely defined exposure period compared to travelers and secondary cases from known human to human transmission events. However, our calculations have shown that adding more cases to the dataset even with uncertainty reduces both the variance of the estimates and selection bias, improving the fit of the distribution mean. Our estimates are in agreement with the report of Li et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].

Notably, our results demonstrated the overall benefit of using additional case data, even when some of exposure values were not precisely known.",
            "The time from the illness onset to death is also comparable to SARS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], and the 15\u201320-day mean delay indicates that a crude estimation of the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to that of confirmed cases will tend to result in an underestimation of the case fatality risk, especially during the early stage of epidemic spread. During the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, 2003, the time from illness onset to hospital admission was shown to have shortened as a function of the calendar time, gradually reflecting the effects of contact tracing [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. It remains to be seen if this will be the case for COVID-19 as well. The time delay distribution between illness onset and hospital admission may also be negatively associated with the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a fully susceptible population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].",
            "The median time from illness onset to hospital admission was approximately 4 days among cases not known to be deceased at the time of the case report, and 6 days among cases reported as deceased. The reasons for this difference are not altogether clear. However, the living cases include persons who were isolated\u2013in some cases more for reducing transmission than for treatment purposes\u2013while all deceased cases were admitted for treatment. In addition, deceased cases for whom information was available had onset dates closer to the beginning of the outbreak compared to the living cases, who mostly had onset in the latter two-thirds of January 2020. The time delay distributions from illness onset to hospital admission for cases reported later in the epidemic, when there was a more widespread recognition of the virus and a more prevalent social imperative for those with symptoms to seek healthcare, may differ from those of early cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].",
