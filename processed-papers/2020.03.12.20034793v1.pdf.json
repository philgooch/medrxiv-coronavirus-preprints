        "abstract": "Using a sensitive research-grade infrared camera, we find that common facial cosmetics and lotions mask skin temperature in assays of the human forehead. We test a family of 10 commonly-used cosmetic products and find that volatile liquids and creams lower thermal skin temperature by at least 2 C for up to 5-10 min and at least 1 C for up to 20 min, respectively. Powder and cream that contains brightening agent lower indefinitely the skin temperature sensed by infrared camera. With the qualification that these experiments were performed in a controlled laboratory setting rather than the mass crowd screening environment where infrared temperature sensing of humans sees widespread use, our tests suggest that for human subjects whose face was treated with certain cosmetics and lotions, infrared-based screening for elevated facial temperature (fever) can be unreliable.",

            "The 10 cosmetic products that we investigated are summarized in Table I.    II. EXPERIMENTAL<br/><br/>For noncontact infrared thermal measurement9,10, we used a low-noise, high-performance mid-infrared research grade camera, FLIR A8303sc (FLIR, Inc., Wilsonville, OR, USA) with nominal resolution <0.02 \u25e6C. The measurements were quantified using the company\u2019s software, FLIR ResearchIR MAX. The measurements, made at 3 Hz, were averaged over 30 s to produce the data presented here.<br/><br/>Function Brightening Cream Cream Powder Highlighter Sunscreen (Emulsion) Sunscreen (Cream) Foundation Lotion Toner Gel Cream Mask<br/><br/>Raw data. Fig. 1 illustrates raw data. The left panel (Fig. 1a), a typical thermal image, shows skin temperature measured in different regions of the subject\u2019s face. One complication is that the subject inevitably shifted position of his head during the long measurement times, thereby presenting the possibility that the apparent temperature might shift owing to change in the measurement focus. To compensate for this possibility, we made differential measurements between two regions of the forehead, one blank region (cosmetic-free), one region to which cosmetics were applied. Showing the excellent reproducibility of the measurement over extended times, Fig. 1b illustrates apparent absolute temperature plotted against time. Naturally, this healthy subject\u2019s skin temperature of \u2248 34.35 C was below his body temperature, which was normal.<br/><br/>is plotted against time after the cosmetic was applied. Cosmetic #1, marketed as a tone-up brightening cream, produced the largest depression of skin temperature. Skin temperature was depressed by at least 2 C for 15 min and 1 C for 20 min, likely because evaporation of volatile components lowers temperature. The evaporation rate was notably slow, perhaps because the volatile components (water) also dissolve in the skin. After the cosmetic had remained on the skin for 40 min, it was washed with cosmetic remover and strikingly, the skin temperature remained depressed by \u2248 0.8 C. This semi-permanent depression of skin temperature likely reflects the presence of residual solid-state brightener specified as an active ingredient in the product\u2019s marketing.<br/><br/>Cosmetic #2, marketed as a natural moisturizing cream, also depressed the skin temperature by at least 2 C for 15 min and 1 C for 20 min. After this time, the skin temperature continued to decrease, probably reflecting the continuing absorption of cream into skin. After 40 min, no further change was observed.<br/><br/>Cosmetic #3, a powder highlighter containing dry powder, mica and talc, produced similar depression of skin temperature as the long-time effect of cosmetic #1, except that it lacked the strong temperature depression associated with evaporation of copious volatile liquid. The steady-state temperature depression was \u2248 0.8 C.<br/><br/>Creams, powder. In Fig. 2, the effect of applying cosmetic is considered. Depression of skin temperature<br/><br/>Sunscreen. In Fig. 3, depression of skin temperature is plotted against time after sunscreens were applied. Cosmetic #4, an emulsion sunscreen, produced no depression of skin temperature after 5 min, reflecting rapid evaporation of the alcohol carrier liquid. However, cosmetic #5, a broad-spectrum cream sunscreen, produced markedly long-lived depression of the skin temperature for times extending beyond 30 min.<br/><br/>Evidently these effects are not in proportion to the SPF (sun protection value) as SPF=50 and 30 for the former and latter, respectively. Skin temperature depression was less for the sunscreen with higher SPF. Instead, the remarkably strong temperature depression produced by cosmetic #5 appears to be that, just as for cosmetics #1 and #2, it is a cream.<br/><br/>Other cosmetics. In Fig. 4, depression of skin temperature is plotted against time for 5 additional cosmetics and for reference the strong temperaturedepression effect of cosmetic #1 is included. Cosmetic #6, a foundation common in facial makeup, showed negligible effect after 5 min, despite the fact that the likely major components of residue are talc, mica, silica, dimethicone, zinc stearate, and titanium oxide. Cosmetic #7, a lotion with more volatile components, produced stronger temperature depression during the initial 5 min, but after 10 min there was no effect. For cosmetic #8, a toner, and cosmetic #9, a water-like gel cream, the effect likewise disappeared after 10 min.<br/><br/>amount of depression falls into the following categories: (1) Cosmetics that lower skin temperature by the physical principle of evaporative cooling. The fact that liquids absorb heat to evaporate has been used for thousands of years for air conditioning, at least as long ago as in ancient Egypt, Persia, and India.11 In cosmetics, this short-term effect appears to disappear after 5-15 min. (2) Cosmetics that lower skin temperature by acting as a barrier layer between skin and surrounding air. The effect is marked for creams but the effect appears to disappear after 20-30 min, perhaps as cream is absorbed into the skin. (3) Cosmetics that lower skin temperature because they contain solids. The effect was most marked for brightening cream and powder highlighter, cosmetics #1 and #3, respectively. Depression of skin temperature appears to persist semi-indefinitely, probably because solid particles in the cosmetic, with lower emissivity than skin, are embedded in the skin. However, this effect is less prominent for foundation (cosmetic #6), suggesting that size of the solid particles matters.<br/><br/>Cosmetic #10, a facial mask used to moisturize the skin, was left on the face for 30 min and skin temperature was monitored subsequently. A large effect was observed for the initial 10 min but there was no effect after 15 min."
