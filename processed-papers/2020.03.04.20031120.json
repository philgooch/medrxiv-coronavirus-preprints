        "abstract": "BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged infection from the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure.\nMETHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), plasma creatinine, and urea concentrations along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six other patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry.\nRESULTS Among these 85 COVID-19 cases, 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF), and elder patients (\u2265 60 years old) are easier to develop ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p&lt; 0.001). Comorbidities of disorders like hypertension and heart failure were more common in patients who developed ARF (69.57% vs 11.29%, p&lt; 0.001). Dynamic observation of eGFR revealed that perished cases have a rapid decrease of eGFR but quickly boosting plasma creatinine and urea. On the other hand, enhancement of eGFR and persistence low level of plasma creatinine and urea was observed in recovery patients following diuretic treatment. H&amp;E staining demonstrated kidney tissues from 6 cases of postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis but no evidence of glomerular pathology or tubulointerstitial lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules.  \nCONCLUSIONS The development of ARF during the course of disease is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 virus directly infects human kidney tubules by thus induces acute tubular damage, ARF and probably also lead to urine transmission.",

Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China. All the patients were laboratory-confirmed positives for SARS-CoV-2 by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on throat swab samples. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of General Hospital of Central Theatre Command and Jinyintan Hospital.<br/><br/>Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Data collection and definitions We reviewed clinical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays or CT scans for all the patients. All information was obtained and curated with a customized data collection form. eGFR was calculated by the CKD-EPI equation based on serum creatinine level,sex, race and age. Acute renal impairment was defined as a decline of eGFR by at least 30% of the baseline value on admission or below90mL/min on admission. Three investigators (C Wang, Z Fen and Y Chen) independently reviewed the data collection forms to verify data accuracy."

SARS-CoV-2 induces ARF in COVID-19 patients<br/><br/>We retrospectively analyzed laboratory kidney functions from 85 cases of COVID-19 patients, focusing first on eGFR. 27.06% (23/85) COVID-19 patients exhibited acute renal failure (Table1), suggesting renal function impairment is relatively common in COVID-19 patients. Patients who are older (>60 years) or carry comorbidities more easily developed ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001; 69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001, respectively). Dynamic survey in five COVID-19 patients showed that the perished cases have a rapid eGFR decline, but the concentrations of plasma creatinine and urea rapidly rose during disease progression. On the other hand, gradual recovery of eGFR was observed in convalescent patients, whose plasma creatinine and urea concentrations were low throughout the observation period (Figure 1), suggesting ARF is a risk factor result in perish during SARS-CoV-2 infection.<br/><br/>2.

        "BACKGROUND": [
            "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged infection from the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), plasma creatinine, and urea concentrations along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six other patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Among these 85 COVID-19 patients, 27.06% (23/85) COVID-19 patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF), and elder patients (\u2265 60 years old) are easier to develop ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001). Comorbidities of disorders like hypertension and heart failure were more common in patients who developed ARF (69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001). Dynamic observation of eGFR revealed that perished cases have a rapid decrease of eGFR but quickly boosting plasma creatinine and urea. On the other hand, enhancement of eGFR and persistence low level of plasma creatinine and urea was observed in recovery patients following diuretic treatment. H&E staining demonstrated kidney tissues from 6 cases of postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis but no evidence of glomerular pathology. Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. CONCLUSIONS The development of ARF during the course of disease is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 virus directly infects human kidney tubules by thus induces acute tubular damage ARF and probably also lead to urine transmission."

        "Introduction": [
            "In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] This disease, now designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO, rapidly spread to other cities of China and around the world.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] By March 3, 2020, 80270 cases were laboratory confirmed and 2981 were death in China based on CCDC (Chinese Center For Disease Control And Prevention) reported.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]",
            "Some studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV (Severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus) share a common ancestor resembling the bat coronavirus HKU9\u20101.8,9 Recently, Shi et al, reported that SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-II) molecules via its Spike protein.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] In addition to respiratory organs, the expression of ACE2 protein has also been observed in human kidneys,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] and Cheng et al, reported that some COVID-19 patients had an elevated level of proteinuria.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] However, no evidence directly demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect the kidney to cause acute renal failure.",
            "We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data on kidney functions from 85 cases of COVID-19 who were admitted into the General Hospital of Central Theatre Command and Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, Hubei Province, from January 17, 2020 to March 3 , 2020.. We also used H&E staining and immunohistochemistry to visually assess tissue damage and viral NP antigen presence in kidney tissues from six biopsies."

        "Methods": [
            "Patients Medical records from 85 COVID-19 patients (aged from 21 years to 92 years) with dynamic observation of renal function in General Hospital of Central Theatre Command in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China. All the patients were laboratory-confirmed positives for SARS-CoV-2 by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on throat swab samples. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of General Hospital of Central Theatre Command and Jinyintan Hospital.",
            "Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Data collection and definitions We reviewed clinical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays or CT scans for all the patients. All information was obtained and curated with a customized data collection form. eGFR was calculated by the CKD-EPI equation based on serum creatinine level,sex, race and age. Acute renal impairment was defined as a decline of eGFR by at least 30% of the baseline value on admission or below90mL/min on admission. Three investigators (C Wang, Z Fen and Y Chen) independently reviewed the data collection forms to verify data accuracy.",
            "Tissue morphology detection and immunohistochemistry Due to the special infection-control precaution of handling deceased subjects with COVID-19, postmortem examination was performed in a designated pathology laboratory. Kidney specimens from autopsy were retrieved for standard examination via light microscopy. Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut into 3 \u03bcm slices and mounted onto poly-lysine-coated glass slides, and tissue injury was stained for by H&E. Sections were also used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen by immunohistochemistry as following: Antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving these sections in citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0). The sections were then incubated in 3% BSA plus 0.1% H2O2 for 1h at RT to block nonspecific binding. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocaspid protein (NP) antibodies (1:100, rabbit IgG; Sino Biologic, Beijing) or rabbit-isotype antibody controls (1:100; Dako). Sections were further incubated with the HRP-anti-Rabbit secondary antibodies for 1h at RT. Peroxidase activity was visualized with the DAB Elite kit (K3465, DAKO), and the brown coloration of tissues represented positive staining as viewed by a light microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2, Germany).",

        "1. SARS-CoV-2 induces ARF in COVID-19 patients": [
            "We retrospectively analyzed laboratory kidney functions from 85 cases of COVID-19 patients, focusing first on eGFR. 27.06% (23/85) COVID-19 patients exhibited acute renal failure (Table1), suggesting renal function impairment is relatively common in COVID-19 patients. Patients who are older (>60 years) or carry comorbidities more easily developed ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001; 69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001, respectively). Dynamic survey in five COVID-19 patients showed that the perished cases have a rapid eGFR decline, but the concentrations of plasma creatinine and urea rapidly rose during disease progression. On the other hand, gradual recovery of eGFR was observed in convalescent patients, whose plasma creatinine and urea concentrations were low throughout the observation period (Figure 1), suggesting ARF is a risk factor result in perish during SARS-CoV-2 infection."
        ],
        "2. SARS-CoV-2 induces human kidney injury": [
            "The histopathological examination was performed by H&E- staining in kidney specimens from autopsy of six COVID-19 subjects with renal function impairment prior to death. Varying degrees of acute tubular necrosis, luminal brush border sloughing, and vacuole degeneration, was found in different areas of all six renal specimens. Severe infiltration of lymphocytes was only observed in one patient while minimal infiltration was seen in the other two cases. At the same time, benign hypertensive glomerulosclerosis and autolysis were noted in three cases, whereas, dilated capillary vessel were also observed in the glomeruli of 6 cases (Figure 2, Table 2). Collectively, these results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe acute tubular necrosis."
        ],
        "3. SARS-CoV-2 directly infects human kidney tubules": [
            "Our results reported above indicate that SARS-CoV-2 might directly induce tubular damage. To confirm this possibility, the viral NP antigen was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigens could be seen in kidney tissues from all of the samples. NP expression was restricted in kidney tubules, and the expression was observed in cytoplasm, whereas, the nucleus was absence NP antigen. NP antigen was also absent in infiltrated lymphocytes and the glomerulus. Furthermore, normal kidney tissues and renal sections only treated with rabbit isotype control antibodies showed no signal (Figure 3). Collectively, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects kidney tubules to induce acute tubular necrosis. Discussion",
            "In this study, we found that 27.06% of patients with COVID-9 had abnormal eGFR, suggesting that acute renal damage is relatively common following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This phenomenon is different from the 2003 outbreak SARS, which ARF was uncommon even though it was one of the top risk factors of mortality.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] Patient who are aged or have comorbidities more commonly developed ARF, suggesting that these patients should be more closely examined to prevent ARF onset. We also summarized the dynamic eGFR from 5 COVID-9 patients who have long-term observation, and found that the perished cases manifested rapid decline in eGFR, and a rapid increase of the plasma creatinine and urea concentrations, with the levels peaking prior to death. On the other hand, enhancement of eGFR level but persistent low levels of plasma creatinine and urea were observed in recovered patients who were treated with diuretics, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 mediated ARF may be one of the major causes of multiorgan failure and eventual death in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we strongly suggest that applying potential interventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for protecting kidney function in COVID-19 patients, particular for ARF cases, maybe a key method to preventing fatality.",
            "To further analyze how SARS-CoV-2 affects renal function, we focused on analyzing renal tissue morphology from autopsies. H&E staining showed that acute renal tubular damage was observed in all six cases during postmortem examinations, while the glomeruli were intact, except for two cases with slight glomerulosclerosis and one case has scrap glomeruli, suggesting that other conditions such as diabetic nephropathy may have been involved. The infiltration of immune cells was not obvious except in one patient, indicating that acute renal damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 is independent of immune-mediated injury (Figure 2). It has been shown that the ACE-2 receptor of SARS-CoV is highly expressed in renal tubules.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] We used immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of viral NP antigen in situ in kidney tissues, and found that viral NP antigen was restricted to the renal tubular cells of the infected tissues. Our results strongly suggest that renal tubular injury is directly caused by viral infection and replication because SARS-CoV-2 is a cytopathic virus. This phenomenon is consistent with its other similarities to SARS-CoV and",
            "MERS-Cov, both of which can also infect human kidney.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] Recently, Zhao et al reported they have successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus particles from urine of COVID-19 patients, and together with our study demonstrate that the kidney is also the site of viral infection and replication outside of the lungs, and suggest that kidney-originated viral particles may enter the urine through glomerular filtration.",
            "One limitation of this paper is that due to the high infectivity and the complexity of specimen preparation, we were unable to present electron microscopy imaging to further clarify the subcellular distribution of virus particles in kidney in situ. In the next step, we will cooperate with other laboratories to carry out this work.",
            "In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly infect human renal tubules and consequently lead to acute renal tubular injury. Moreover, improvement of eGFR would increase the survival of COVID-19 patients who have ARF.",
