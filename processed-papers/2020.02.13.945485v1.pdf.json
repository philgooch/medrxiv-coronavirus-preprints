        "abstract": "The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel coronavirus, provisionally termed 2019-nCoV. This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.",

            "Ethics Statement<br/><br/>The animals studied here were rescued and treated by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous<br/><br/>Region Terrestrial Wildlife Medical-aid and Monitoring Epidemic Diseases Research Center under the ethics approval (wild animal treatment regulation No [2011] 85). The samples were collected following the procedure guideline (Pangolins Rescue Procedure, November, 2016).<br/><br/>Sample collection, viral detection and sequencing of pangolins in Guangxi<br/><br/>We received frozen tissue samples of 18 pangolins (Manis javanica) from Guangxi Medical<br/><br/>University, China, which were collected between August 2017 \u2013 January 2018. These pangolins were seized by the Guangxi Customs during their routine anti-smuggling operations. All animal individuals comprised samples from multiple organs including lungs, intestine and blood, with the exception of six individuals for which only lung tissues were available, five with mixed intestine and lung tissues only, one with intestine tissues only, and one comprising two blood samples. Using the intestine-lung mixed sample we were able to isolate a novel Betacoronavirus using the Vero-E6 cell line (Extended Data Figure S1). A<br/><br/>High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche, Switzerland) was used for RNA extraction on all 43 samples. For RNA sequencing, a sequencing library was constructed using an Ion Total<br/><br/>RNA-Seq Kit v2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), and the library was subsequently sequenced using an Ion Torrent S5 sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse<br/><br/>Transcription was performed using an SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-<br/><br/>PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). DNA libraries were constructed using the<br/><br/>NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced on a MiSeq sequencer. The NGS<br/><br/>QC Toolkit V2.3.3 was used to remove low-quality and short reads. Both BLASTn and<br/><br/>BLASTx were used to search against a local virus database, utilizing the data available at<br/><br/>NCBI/GenBank. Genome sequences were assembled using the CLC Genomic Workbench v.9.0. To fill gaps in high throughput sequencing and obtain the whole viral genome sequence, amplicon primers based on the bat SARS-like coronavirus ZC45 (GenBank accession number MG772933) sequence were designed for amplicon-based sequencing.<br/><br/>A total of six samples (including the virus isolate) contained reads that matched a<br/><br/>Betacoronavirus (Extended Data Table S1). We obtained near complete genomes from these samples (98%, compared to 2019-nCoV), with the virus genomes denoted as GX/P1E, GX/P2V, GX/P3B, GX/P4L, GX/P5E and GX/P5L. Based on these genome sequences, we designed primers for qPCR to confirm the positivity of the original tissue samples (Extended<br/><br/>Data Table S4). This revealed an original lung tissue sample that was also qPCR positive, in addition to the six original samples with coronavirus reads. We further tested an addition 19 samples (nine intestine tissues, ten lung tissues), from 12 smuggled pangolins sampled between May-July 2018 by the group from Guangxi Medical University. The genome sequences of GX/P1E, GX/P2V, GX/P3B, GX/P4L, GX/P5E and GX/P5L were submitted to<br/><br/>GenBank and GISAID databases, their accession numbers will be available as soon as it is generated.<br/><br/>Sample collection, viral detection and sequencing of pangolins in Guangdong<br/><br/>After the start of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the Guangzhou Customs Technology Center reexamined their five archived pangolin samples (two skin swabs, one unknown tissue, one scale) obtained in anti-smuggling operations undertaken in March 2019. RNA was extracted from all five samples (Qiagen, USA), and was subjected to high-throughput RNA sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform by Vision medicals, Guangdong, China. The scale sample was found to contain coronavirus reads using BLAST methods. These reads were quality assessed, cleaned and assembled into contigs by both de novo (MEGAHIT v1.1.312) and using reference (BWA v0.7.1313) assembly methods, with BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 as reference. The contigs were combined, and approximately 72% of the coronavirus genome (21,505bp) was obtained. This sequence was denoted as pangolin CoV GD/P2S.<br/><br/>Liu et al recently published a meta-transcriptomic study of pangolins7 and deposited 21<br/><br/>RNA-seq raw files on the SRA database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). We screened these raw read files using BLAST methods and found that five (SRR10168374, SRR10168376, SRR10168377, SRR10168378 and SRR10168392) contained reads that mapped to 2019-nCoV. These reads were subjected to quality assessment, cleaning and then de novo assembly using MEGAHIT12 and reference assembly using BWA13. These reads were then merged and curated in a pileup alignment file to obtain the consensus sequences.<br/><br/>This combined consensus sequence is 25,753bp in length (about 86.3% of<br/><br/>BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) and denoted pangolin CoV GD/P1L. Notably, it has 66.8%<br/><br/>overlap and only 0.21% divergence (i.e. a sequence identify of 99.79%) with the GD/P2S sequence. Since their genetic difference is so low, for the recombination analysis we merged the GD/P1L and GD/P2S sequences into a single consensus sequence to minimize gap regions within any sequences.<br/><br/>The viral genome organizations of Guangxi and Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses were similar to 2019-nCoV. They had a total number of 9 open reading frames (ORFs) and shared the same gene order of ORF1ab replicase, envelope glycoprotein spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), plus other predicted ORFs. Detailed comparison of the<br/><br/>ORF length and similarity with 2019-nCoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13 is provided in<br/><br/>Extended Table S5.<br/><br/>Sequence, phylogenetic and recombination analyses<br/><br/>The human 2019-nCoV and bat RaTG13 coronavirus genome sequences were downloaded from Virological.org (http://virological.org) and the GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) databases on 17 January 2020, with the data kindly shared by the submitters (Extended Data<br/><br/>Table S2). Other coronaviruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus) were downloaded from GenBank (Extended Data Table S3) and compared to those obtained here. We constructed a multiple sequence alignment of their complete genomes and individual genes using MAFFT v7.27314.<br/><br/>Maximum likelihood phylogenies were estimated using PhyML v3.115, utilizing the<br/><br/>GTR+I+G model of nucleotide substitution with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. To investigate potential recombination events, we implemented a window sliding approach to determine the changing patterns of sequence similarity and phylogenetic clustering between the query and the reference sequences, as well as a scanning of phylogenetic clusters performed directly from the multiple sequence alignment. Maximum likelihood trees were estimated from each window extraction (i.e. genome regions 1 to 8) using PhyML as described above."

            "The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel coronavirus, provisionally termed 2019-nCoV. This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.",
            "2019. The causative agent was soon identified as a novel coronavirus - 2019-nCoV1. Case numbers grew rapidly from 27 in December 2019 to 7,818 globally as of 30 January 20202, leading to the WHO to declare a public health emergency. Many of the early cases were linked to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city, Hubei province, from where the probable zoonotic source is speculated to originate3. Currently, only environmental samples taken from the market have been reported as positive for 2019-nCoV by the China CDC4. However, as similar wet markets were already implicated in the SARS outbreak of 2002-20035, it seems likely that wild animals are also involved in the emergence of 2019-nCoV. Indeed, a number of non-aquatic mammals were available for purchase in the Huanan seafood market prior to the outbreak4. Unfortunately, because the market was cleared soon after the outbreak began, determining the source virus in the wild animals from the market is challenging. Although a coronavirus closely related to 2019-nCoV sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis bat in Yunnan in 2013 has now been identified6, closely related viruses have not yet been detected in other wildlife species. Here, we present the identification of 2019-nCoV related viruses in pangolins smuggled into southern China.",

Strikingly, highthroughput sequencing of their RNA revealed the presence of coronaviruses in six (two lung, two intestine, one lung-intestine mix, one blood) of 43 samples. With the sequence read data, and by filling gaps with amplicon sequencing, we were able to obtain six full or nearly full genome sequences - denoted GX/P1E, GX/P2V, GX/P3B, GX/P4L, GX/P5E and GX/P5L -",

Notably, another study of diseased pangolins in Guangdong performed in 2019 also identified viral contigs from lung samples that were similarly related to 2019-nCoV7.

It has previously been noted that members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus have experienced widespread recombination8. In support of this, a recombination analysis performed here revealed that bat coronaviruses ZC45 and ZCS21 are likely recombinants, containing genome fragments from multiple SARS-CoV related lineages (genome regions 2, 5, 7) and 2019-nCoV related lineages including that from pangolins (regions 1, 3, 4, 6, 8).",

            "nCoV (Figure 2b). Hence, it is possible that the amino acid similarity between the RBD of the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV is due to selectively-mediated convergent evolution rather than recombination, although it is difficult to choose between these scenarios on current data. Although the drivers of any convergent evolution are unknown, its possible occurrence, as well as that of recombination, would further highlight the role played by intermediate animal hosts in human virus emergence.",

This suggests that these animals may be long-term reservoir hosts for these viruses, which is surprising as pangolins are solitary animals with relatively small population sizes, reflecting their endangered status10. However, it cannot be excluded that pangolins acquired their 2019-nCoV related viruses independently from bats or another animal host. It is also notable that both lineages of pangolin coronaviruses were obtained from trafficked Malayan pangolins, likely originating from",
            "Southeast Asia, and there is a marked lack of knowledge of the viral diversity maintained by this animal in regions where it is indigenous. Undoubtedly, the extent of virus transmission in pangolin populations requires additional investigation, but the repeated occurrence of infections with 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces suggests that this animal may be a potentially important host in coronavirus emergence.",
            "Coronaviruses, including those related to 2019-nCoV, are clearly present in many wild mammals in Asia5,6,7,11. Although the epidemiology, pathogenicity, interspecies infectivity and transmissibility of coronaviruses in pangolins remains to be studied, the data presented here strongly suggests that handling these animals requires considerable caution, and that their sale in wet markets should be strictly prohibited. Further surveillance on pangolins in the natural environment in China and Southeast Asia are clearly needed to understand their role in the emergence of 2019-nCoV and the risk of future zoonotic transmission."

            "More notable, however, was the observation of putative recombination signals between the pangolins coronaviruses, bat coronaviruses RaTG13, and human 2019-nCoV (Figure 1c, d).",
            "In particular, 2019-nCoV exhibits very high sequence similarity to the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses in the receptor-binding domain (RBD; 97.4% amino acid similarity; indicated by red arrow in Figure 1c and Figure 2a), even though it is most closely related to bat coronavirus RaTG13 in the remainder of the viral genome. Bat CoV RaTG and the human",
            "2019-nCoV have only 89.2% amino acid similarity in RBD. Indeed, the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV possess identical amino acids at the five critical residues of the",
            "RBD, whereas RaTG13 only shares one amino acid with 2019-nCoV (residue 442, human",
            "SARS-CoV numbering9). Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis of synonymous sites alone in the RBD revealed that the phylogenetic position of the Guangdong pangolin is consistent with that in the remainder of the viral genome, rather than being the closest relative of 2019-",
            "nCoV (Figure 2b). Hence, it is possible that the amino acid similarity between the RBD of the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV is due to selectively-mediated convergent evolution rather than recombination, although it is difficult to choose between these scenarios on current data. Although the drivers of any convergent evolution are unknown, its possible occurrence, as well as that of recombination, would further highlight the role played by intermediate animal hosts in human virus emergence.",
            "To date, pangolins are the only mammals other than bats documented to be infected by a",
            "2019-nCoV related coronavirus. It is striking that two related lineages of CoVs are found in pangolins and that both are also related to 2019-nCoV. This suggests that these animals may be long-term reservoir hosts for these viruses, which is surprising as pangolins are solitary animals with relatively small population sizes, reflecting their endangered status10. However, it cannot be excluded that pangolins acquired their 2019-nCoV related viruses independently from bats or another animal host. It is also notable that both lineages of pangolin coronaviruses were obtained from trafficked Malayan pangolins, likely originating from",
            "Southeast Asia, and there is a marked lack of knowledge of the viral diversity maintained by this animal in regions where it is indigenous. Undoubtedly, the extent of virus transmission in pangolin populations requires additional investigation, but the repeated occurrence of infections with 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces suggests that this animal may be a potentially important host in coronavirus emergence.",
            "Coronaviruses, including those related to 2019-nCoV, are clearly present in many wild mammals in Asia5,6,7,11. Although the epidemiology, pathogenicity, interspecies infectivity and transmissibility of coronaviruses in pangolins remains to be studied, the data presented here strongly suggests that handling these animals requires considerable caution, and that their sale in wet markets should be strictly prohibited. Further surveillance on pangolins in the natural environment in China and Southeast Asia are clearly needed to understand their role in the emergence of 2019-nCoV and the risk of future zoonotic transmission."
