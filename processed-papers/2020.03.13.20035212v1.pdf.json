        "abstract": "In the end of 2019, the epidemic of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan and spread rapidly. Changsha, a city located south to the epicenter, was soon impacted. To control the transmission of the coronavirus and avoid nosocomial infection, triage procedures based on epidemiology were implemented in a local hospital of the city. This retrospective study analyzed the data collected during the triage period and found that COVID-19 patients were enriched seven folds into the Section A designated for rapid detection and quarantine. On the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B for patients without obvious epidemiological history. Eight COVID19 cases were spotted out of 247 suspected patients. More than 50% of the suspected patients were submitted to multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 239 patients who were diagnosed as negative of the virus infection,[188] were successfully revisited and none was reported as a COVID-19 case. Of the eight COVID-19 patients, three were confirmed only after multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis. Besides comorbidities, delayed sharing of epidemiological history added another layer of complexity to the diagnosis in practice. While SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is being alerted in many countries, our report will be helpful to other colleagues in rapid identification of COVID-19 cases and controlling the transmission of the disease.",

            "The current epidemic of Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan (Hubei province) in December 2019 and rapidly spread to other areas in China and more than 100 other countries.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of March 1, 2020, the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China have reached 79 968 with 2873 deaths (fatality rate 3.6%).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] More than 60% of the confirmed cases were reported from Wuhan.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus species from the genus Betacoronavirus that leads to major epidemics in 21st century.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] To prevent the disease transmission, China has suspended all public transport in and out of Wuhan since January 23, 2020.7<br/><br/>Changsha, a city located 350 kilometers south of the epicenter, reported its first imported COVID-19 case on January 21 and the highest level of public health emergency response was declared two days later.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] The common symptoms of COVID-19 patients at illness onset include fever, cough, expectoration, headache, myalgia or fatigue, diarrhoea and haemoptysis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Some of these symptoms resemble much like other diseases including flu, which has high occurrence in winter. To avoid the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within hospital, triage procedures for patients were implemented between January 28 and February 20 in a local hospital (Xiangya Hospital) of Changsha to facilitate the rapid detection and quarantine of COVID-19 patients. Here we describe the clinical practice of triaging patients in the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, along with the clinical and laboratory characteristics of eight COVID-19 cases identified from more than 240 suspected individuals with various symptoms triaged to the section for patients without obvious epidemiological history."

            "Triage and patients This single-centre, retrospective, observational study was done at Xiangya Hospital (Changsha, China). Patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, myalgia, fatigue, or other symptoms possibly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were received at the triage reception between January 28 and February 20 before being directed to the Section A or B based on epidemiological characteristics.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Patients, who met one of the following conditions within 14 days before illness onset, were sorted to the Section A: (a) exposure to Hubei province or local communities with confirmed COVID-19 cases reported; (b) exposure to patients with similar symptoms from regions mentioned in (a); (c) exposure to known COVID-19 patients; (d) association with clustering occurrence (Figure 1A). Other patients were directed to the Section B.<br/><br/>Besides symptoms, clinical and laboratory characteristics suggestive for SARSCoV-2 infection are: (i) chest computed tomographic (CT) results with pneumonia features; (ii) normal or reduced leucocyte count or reduced lymphocyte count in early onset.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] At the Section A, patients having mild symptoms without both (i) and (ii) were recommended for home quarantine with prescription. Others were quarantined to take oropharyngeal swab (if not specified otherwise) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid analysis by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the Section B, patients with suspected chest CT characteristics (i) were also quarantined for nucleic acid analysis. Others were further evaluated by doctor based on symptoms (fever, respiratory symptoms, myalgia/fatigue, etc.), comorbidities, vital signs and blood routine characteristics: patients with severe symptoms were quarantined for treatment and nucleic acid analysis and were transferred to relevant units for further treatment when diagnosed as negative for SARS-CoV2 infection; patients having mild symptoms without (ii) were recommended for home quarantine with prescription, and the rest were submitted for nucleic acid analysis and were recommended for home quarantine with prescription if negative result of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained (the second nucleic acid test after 24 hours was recommended and performed based on patient\u2019s availability) (Figure 1A). Self-quarantined patients were followed up by phone visiting. Identified COVID-19 patients were immediately transferred to designated hospitals for quarantine and treatment.

            "In total, 1125 patients (visiting number) were received at the triage reception (January 28\u2013February 20). Following the triage procedures, 305 visits were directed to the Section A, and 22 COVID-19 cases (7%, 22/305) were confirmed. In the first ten days of triage, confirmed cases were identified nearly every day (Figure 1B). On the other side, 820 visits were directed to the Section B, and eight cases (1%, 8/820) were confirmed (Table S1). Seven of them were spotted in the first ten days (Figure 1B). The implemented triage procedures effectively enriched COVID-19 patients into the Section A and reduced the possibility of transmitting the virus to other patients and medical stuff. During the triaging period, the number of reported COVID-19 patients in Changsha rapidly increased ten times (from 24 to 242) and reached plateau after February 14 (Figure 1B).<br/><br/>Of the 820 visits in the Section B, 239 individual patients were suspected, but laboratory evidence did not support for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 52% (124/239) of them did multiple rounds of nucleic acid test. 188 of 223 patients with contact information were successfully followed up by phone visiting a few days after the last nucleic acid test. None was reported as a COVID-19 case. 89% (167/188) of the patients were phone visited more than a week after their last nucleic acid test (Figure 2). 7% (13/188) of them were double checked by additional medical institutions.<br/><br/>Of the eight COVID-19 patients identified by the Section B, five (cases 1\u20135) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection after one round of nucleic acid analysis (Figure 3 and Table S2). Cases 1 and 2 had no obvious epidemiological history. Cases 3, 4 and 5 (a familial cluster) arrived at the Section B initially without revealing both the contact history with people from Wuhan on a family event as well as the common symptoms among themselves. They were quarantined after the critical epidemiological information was given to the doctor during diagnostic inquiry and were soon confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3). Case 6 was evaluated as suspected COVID-19 case after arriving at the Section B (according to the chest CT images provided by another hospital) and was quarantined for further diagnosis. Nucleic acid analysis was performed on the first and the third day during quarantine. The second analysis supported for the virus infection (Figure 3).<br/><br/>Case 7 arrived from Wuhan on January 22 and was admitted into the hospital in quarantine with cough, high fever and lymphopenia on January 23 before the triaging period (Figure 3, Table S3). The chest CT progress with the ground glass shadow was consistent with the early imaging manifestation of viral pneumonia (Figure S1). Multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis (at least 24 hours apart) before and after being transferred to the Section B failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3). The clinical features of the patient aggravated (Table S3). Subsequently, sputum of the patient was induced by 3% hypertonic saline nebulization and collected for RT-PCR analysis and the virus infection was confirmed (Figure 3). Of note, sputum-promoting operation was not routinely performed, as the effect of aerosol transmission of the virus indoor is of concern.<br/><br/>Before the epidemic alert, case 8 was admitted into the gastroenterology department due to retching for three weeks. During hospitalization (January 15\u2013 22), other symptoms (shortness of breath, chest tightness), which were concealed before by retching, were revealed to the medical staff. He was diagnosed with polyserous effusions, constrictive pericarditis and lung infection and was discharged because of the alleviation of the above symptoms (Figure 3). Before triage, he visited the emergency department due to coughing. The number of leucocytes and lymphocytes was in normal range (Table 1). The chest CT images on January 26 showed bilateral pleural effusion and pericardial effusion (Figure 4A). On February 3, he was admitted to the ICU due to severe coughing and dyspnea with normal blood cell count, no recent suspicious epidemiological history, nor typical chest CT images of viral infection (Figure 4B, Table 1). Four days later, the chest CT images significantly changed and indicated possible viral infection. He was directed to the Section B (Figure 4C). However, the results from double nucleic acid analyses did not support for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3). Meanwhile, the symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, chest tightness) were relieved with supportive treatments. However, the patient\u2019s condition aggravated soon and he was sent into the emergency room. Since the chest CT images still indicated possible viral infection, multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis were performed and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figures 3 and 4D). Of note, both oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for nucleic acid analysis, but only the latter returned a positive result for SARS-CoV-2."

Two cases (cases 7 and 8) seemed to be more complicated than usual. Case 7 arrived at the Section B with two negative nucleic acid reports already. The course of chest CT images, haematological features as well as previous Wuhan experience prompted three more rounds of nucleic acid analysis and finally confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 infection using the lower respiratory tract specimen. Case 8 had been enrolled into the hospital multiple times starting before the epidemic was alerted. Though being thoroughly examined, his comorbidities, no obvious recent epidemic history as well as the initial two negative results of nucleic acid analysis interfered the diagnosis. Accordingly, he was not in quarantine for treatment for roughly six days in the triage period. We only learned during the retrospective study that more than 200 people had returned to his town from Hubei province before January 25. Although this piece of information could not serve as concrete evidence for anything, it would have promoted the doctor to have second thoughts when looking at his case. After being finally confirmed as a COVID-19 case, overlapping patients along his track in the gastroenterology department and in the ICU were revisited. More than ten patients regarded as close contacts in the emergency department were quarantined for observation and diagnosis. Relevant medical stuff was submitted to CT/nucleic acid analysis. No one was found to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Several additional measures were believed to contribute to this outcome: all patients were persuaded to actively wear masks during treatment in hospital area; disinfection of the hospital environment and medical stuff was implemented at least twice more frequently than usual during this period.<br/><br/>So far, no specific medication is available to cure COVID-19.

            "The current epidemic of Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan (Hubei province) in December 2019 and rapidly spread to other areas in China and more than 100 other countries.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of March 1, 2020, the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China have reached 79 968 with 2873 deaths (fatality rate 3.6%).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] More than 60% of the confirmed cases were reported from Wuhan.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus species from the genus Betacoronavirus that leads to major epidemics in 21st century.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] To prevent the disease transmission, China has suspended all public transport in and out of Wuhan since January 23, 2020.7",
            "Changsha, a city located 350 kilometers south of the epicenter, reported its first imported COVID-19 case on January 21 and the highest level of public health emergency response was declared two days later.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] The common symptoms of COVID-19 patients at illness onset include fever, cough, expectoration, headache, myalgia or fatigue, diarrhoea and haemoptysis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Some of these symptoms resemble much like other diseases including flu, which has high occurrence in winter. To avoid the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within hospital, triage procedures for patients were implemented between January 28 and February 20 in a local hospital (Xiangya Hospital) of Changsha to facilitate the rapid detection and quarantine of COVID-19 patients. Here we describe the clinical practice of triaging patients in the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, along with the clinical and laboratory characteristics of eight COVID-19 cases identified from more than 240 suspected individuals with various symptoms triaged to the section for patients without obvious epidemiological history."

Other patients were directed to the Section B.",
            "Besides symptoms, clinical and laboratory characteristics suggestive for SARSCoV-2 infection are: (i) chest computed tomographic (CT) results with pneumonia features; (ii) normal or reduced leucocyte count or reduced lymphocyte count in early onset.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] At the Section A, patients having mild symptoms without both (i) and (ii) were recommended for home quarantine with prescription. Others were quarantined to take oropharyngeal swab (if not specified otherwise) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid analysis by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the Section B, patients with suspected chest CT characteristics (i) were also quarantined for nucleic acid analysis. Others were further evaluated by doctor based on symptoms (fever, respiratory symptoms, myalgia/fatigue, etc.), comorbidities, vital signs and blood routine characteristics: patients with severe symptoms were quarantined for treatment and nucleic acid analysis and were transferred to relevant units for further treatment when diagnosed as negative for SARS-CoV2 infection; patients having mild symptoms without (ii) were recommended for home quarantine with prescription, and the rest were submitted for nucleic acid analysis and were recommended for home quarantine with prescription if negative result of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained (the second nucleic acid test after 24 hours was recommended and performed based on patient\u2019s availability) (Figure 1A). Self-quarantined patients were followed up by phone visiting. Identified COVID-19 patients were immediately transferred to designated hospitals for quarantine and treatment.

Our retrospective study of the triaging practice together with the diagnostic and clinical course of eight COVID-19 patients from 247 suspects will help other colleagues to control the transmission of the virus in the current COVID-19 outbreak."
