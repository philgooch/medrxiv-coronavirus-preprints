        "abstract": "Background: On January 23, 2020, a quarantine was imposed on travel in and out of Wuhan, where the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak originated from. Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China.\nMethods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification.\nResults: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days\u20144.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4\u20149.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification.\nConclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.",

This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.    Main text<br/><br/>On December 31, 2019, the Health Commission in Wuhan, China, announced 27 cases of viral pneumonia. On January 8, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a novel coronavirus was the causative pathogen and was subsequently designated as 2019-nCoV. Anxiety quickly grew in the general public after a preeminent Chinese epidemiologist, Dr Zhong Nanshan, confirmed human-to-human transmission in a televised interview in the evening of January 20, and three days later the entire city of Wuhan was put into quarantine: all public transportation was suspended, and outbound trains and flights were halted. As of February 6, 2020, more than 28,000 cases of 2019-nCoV have been confirmed globally."

            "Our analysis reported a much higher growth rate of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan. A direct comparison can be drawn with a previous analysis that also used internationally confirmed cases to infer the epidemic size and growth in Wuhan (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\">Wu et al, 2020</a>). However, their estimated doubling time is 6.4 days (95% CrI, 5.8 days \u2013 7.1 days). Another report (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\">Li et al, 2020</a>) using the cases in Wuhan estimated the doubling time to be 7.4 days (4.2 days \u2013 14 days). These estimates did not fit our simulated distribution of infections well, even with our impossibly extreme assumption of the travel rate (Figure 2, Panel D). This shows that the epidemic may have been spreading much faster in Wuhan than these earlier estimates."

We repeated the simulation until the infection time is consistent with the case\u2019s trajectory and known exposure to other confirmed cases.

            "Epidemic growth In our Bayesian model fitted using infections before January 21 and assuming constant travel rate, the posterior mean of the growth exponent   was 0.25 (95% CrI, 0.17 \u2013 0.34). This corresponds to a doubling time of 2.9 days (95% CrI, 2.0 days \u2013 4.1 days) and basic reproduction number of 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4 \u2013 9.2). The basic reproduction number is computed using the serial interval previously reported for 2019-nCoV (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\">Li et al, 2020</a>).",

        "Conclusions": [
            "Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.",
            "On December 31, 2019, the Health Commission in Wuhan, China, announced 27 cases of viral pneumonia. On January 8, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a novel coronavirus was the causative pathogen and was subsequently designated as 2019-nCoV. Anxiety quickly grew in the general public after a preeminent Chinese epidemiologist, Dr Zhong Nanshan, confirmed human-to-human transmission in a televised interview in the evening of January 20, and three days later the entire city of Wuhan was put into quarantine: all public transportation was suspended, and outbound trains and flights were halted. As of February 6, 2020, more than 28,000 cases of 2019-nCoV have been confirmed globally.",
            "Using the first 425 confirmed patients of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, a previous report estimated that the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days, the basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 \u2013 3.9) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\">Li et al, 2020</a>). Using internationally exported cases from Wuhan (known days of symptom onset from December 25, 2019 to January 19, 2020) and flight travel data, another report estimated that the basic reproduction number is 2.7 (95% CrI, 2.5 \u2013 2.9) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\">Wu et al, 2020</a>). Other analyses using the series of new confirmed cases have reported larger estimates of the basic reproduction number (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRead_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rRead_et+al_2020_a\">Read et al, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhao_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhao_et+al_2020_a\">Zhao et al, 2020</a>)."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "Our analysis reported a much higher growth rate of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan. A direct comparison can be drawn with a previous analysis that also used internationally confirmed cases to infer the epidemic size and growth in Wuhan (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\">Wu et al, 2020</a>). However, their estimated doubling time is 6.4 days (95% CrI, 5.8 days \u2013 7.1 days). Another report (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\">Li et al, 2020</a>) using the cases in Wuhan estimated the doubling time to be 7.4 days (4.2 days \u2013 14 days). These estimates did not fit our simulated distribution of infections well, even with our impossibly extreme assumption of the travel rate (Figure 2, Panel D). This shows that the epidemic may have been spreading much faster in Wuhan than these earlier estimates.",
            "There are several possible explanations for the large difference in epidemiological estimates. One possible reason is the different study sample. The previous reports used internationally confirmed cases as of January 28 and the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan. In comparison, we used confirmed cases in 6 selected countries and regions with detailed case reports as of February 4. Our selected countries and regions also have good public health surveillance systems and could more easily identified suspected cases in border control. Another key distinction is that our analysis used the simulated infection time instead of the noisier symptom onset as in the previous analyses. By using the cases\u2019 travel history (in particular, international arrival date), we can narrow down when the cases were infected. This reduces the noise in our estimates.",
            "A third distinction with the analysis by (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\">Wu et al, 2020</a></a>) is that our model takes into account the restricted outbound travel from Wuhan since January 23, 2020 --- a milestone event in this epidemic. The analysis by (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\">Wu et al, 2020</a></a>) used a more complicated susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) model and only accounted for the quarantine of Wuhan in their forecast but not in their estimation. Ignoring the travel ban since January 23 could also produce much smaller growth rate in our model. However, we have convincingly demonstrated that this leads to very poor fit of the distribution of infection time.",
            "Our analysis should be viewed in terms of its limitations. The international cases are only \u201cshadows\u201d of the epidemic in Wuhan and we relied on the assumption that they form a representative sample. We used a simple exponential growth model for the new infections and did not account for the dynamics of the epidemics like a SEIR model. We assumed a constant rate of travel in the study period which might not approximate the travel pattern in Wuhan---a transportation hub in central China---very well. In particular, millions of people (substantial proportion of the Wuhan population) traveled back home from Wuhan before the Lunar New Year, which we did not consider in our model. Finally, our estimates are relatively but not entirely insensitive to the incubation period which are crucial in simulating the infection time.",
            "Despite these potential limitations, we convincingly demonstrated that a simple theoretical model --- exponential growth with correction for the travel ban on January 23 --- provides very good fit to the internationally confirmed cases with detailed case trajectories. Our results suggest that the early outbreak of 2019-nCoV could have been spreading much faster in Wuhan than previous estimates. This has important implications in designing prevention measures to control the outbreak in other cities in China and around the world. On the more positive side, our simulated infection rates in January 21 to 23 showed visually significant departure from the previous growth pattern (Panel B, Figure 2). This gives some evidence that the prevention measures following the public confirmation of human-to-human transmission in the evening of January 20 were effective.",
