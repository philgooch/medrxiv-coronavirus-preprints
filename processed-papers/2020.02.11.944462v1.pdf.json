        "abstract": "2 The outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (2019-nCov) represents a pandemic threat that has been 3 declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a 4 key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate 5 medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 \u00c5-resolution cryo-EM 6 structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the 7 trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible 8 conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds 9 ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS10 CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs. The atomic-resolution structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.",

            "Protein expression and purification<br/><br/>To express the prefusion S ectodomain, a gene encoding residues 1\u22121208 of 2019-nCoV S (GenBank: MN908947) with proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987, a \u201cGSAS\u201d<br/><br/>substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682\u2013685), a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag was synthesized and cloned into the mammalian expression vector p\u03b1H. To express the 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1, residues 319\u2212591 of 2019-nCoV S were cloned upstream of a C-terminal HRV3C protease cleavage site, a monomeric Fc tag and an 8XHisTag. Similarly, to express the SARS-CoV RBD-<br/><br/>SD1, residues 306\u2212577 of SARS-CoV S (Urbani strain) were cloned upstream of a C-terminal<br/><br/>HRV3C protease cleavage site, a monomeric Fc tag and an 8XHisTag. Lastly, a plasmid encoding residues 1\u2212615 of human ACE2 with a C-terminal HRV3C protease cleavage site, a<br/><br/>TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag was generated.<br/><br/>These expression vectors were used to transiently transfect FreeStyle293F cells (Thermo<br/><br/>Fischer) using polyethylenimine. Protein was purified from filtered cell supernatants using either<br/><br/>StrepTactin resin (IBA) or Protein A resin (Pierce) before being subjected to additional purification by size-exclusion chromatography using either a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE<br/><br/>Healthcare) or a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare) in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3. ACE2 and the 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 were incubated with 10%<br/><br/>(wt/wt) HRV3C protease for 2 hours at room temperature. Cleaved protein was then passed over either NiNTA resin (ACE2) or Protein A and NiNTA resins (2019-nCoV RBD) to remove cleaved tags and His-tagged protease before being run over a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3.<br/><br/>Plasmids encoding the heavy and light chains of S230, 80R and m396 IgG were transiently transfected into Expi293 (Thermo Fischer) using polyethylenimine. Antibodies were purified from cell supernatants using Protein A resin before being used for biolayer interferometry.<br/><br/>Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection<br/><br/>Purified 2019-nCoV S was diluted to a concentration of 0.35 mg/mL in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200<br/><br/>mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3. 3 uL of protein was deposited on a CF-1.2/1.3 grid that had been plasma cleaned for 30 seconds in a Solarus 950 plasma cleaner (Gatan) with a 4:1 ratio of O2/H2.<br/><br/>Excess protein was blotted away for 6 seconds before being plunge frozen into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Scientific). Frozen grids were imaged in a Titan Krios (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a K3 detector (Gatan).

The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation.
