        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE \nTo reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients outside of Wuhan, from five hospitals in east of Zhejiang province, China. \nDESIGN \nRetrospective case series. \nSETTING \nFive hospitals in east of Zhejiang province, China. \nPARTICIPANTS \n88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to hospital. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. \nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES \nA team of physicians who had been treating these patients extracted and recorded the exposure history, clinical symptoms, chest computed tomography and laboratory findings from medical records and sent the data to the working group in Ningbo to review and calculate. \nRESULTS \nOf all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple.\nThe most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). The median of incubation period was 6 (IQR, 3-8) days and the median time from first visit to a doctor to confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days. According to the Chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia, and 27.47% cases showed unilateral pneumonia. \nCONCLUSION\nSocial activity cluster, family cluster and travel by airplane were how COVID-19 patients get transmitted and could be rapidly diagnosed COVID-19 in Zhejiang.",

Thus, CT could be used as an important differential method in cities where they are lacking nucleic acid kits, like Wuhan, and help to bring forward the isolation period for the infected.",
            "Currently, no anti-viral agents have been proven to be effective treatment for COVID-19. It is reported that combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir had been applied to SARS-CoV-2 patients with substantial clinical benefit.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] As an emerging virus, all the patients received antiviral agents in Ningbo cohort, including Kaletra (Lopinavir/Ritonavir) and Umifenovir, 9 cases received methylprednisolone to treat high fever, SpO2 \u226493% and hypoxiemia. The dose of methylprednisolone depends on disease severity between 1mg/kg to 2mg/kg. However, the outcome is still unclear.",
            "As of 16 February 2020, no death has been reported in Zhejiang province as the government authority has taken unprecedented and effective effort to reduce the risk of transmission. Early diagnosis, early isolation and early management all contributed to reducing transmission and mortality in Zhejiang. However, 60 patients are still hospitalization and their cases should be followed up in the future.",
            "Our study has some limitations. Firstly, two thirds of patients are still hospitalized. For those who had been released their cases are being followed up for 2 weeks, and further information can be learnt from these individuals. Secondly, we just have recruited 91 cases. Increasing the number of cases is good for observing COVID-19 outside of Wuhan/Hubei. Thirdly, we did not have many severe cases to compare the differences of epidemiological and clinical features.",
