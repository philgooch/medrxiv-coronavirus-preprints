        "abstract": "Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an online tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: Using our online tool and the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: Social contact data, Data sharing initiative, User interface.",

            "Most survey designs were derived from the POLYMOD survey design though each survey had additional features and objectives which could provide useful additional information. Therefore tools such as this one do not capture the full potential of each data set separately. The social contact analysis presented here focuses only on adapting school and work contacts. It does not capture compensation behavior due to not being at school or work, nor social distancing due to (pandemic) scares.<br/><br/>Our estimates only account for adapted social contact patterns and do not account for age-specific differences in susceptibility or shedding. For example, assuming susceptibility and infectivity is lower for children, would imply that school closure as an intervention would have less impact whereas telework would have a larger impact. Our estimates also do not take into account travel restrictions or cancellation of public events, both of which may well have a large impact."

The UI enables the selection of a country, age categories, type of day (weekday, weekend, holiday, regular), contact duration (<15min, >15min, >1h, >4h), contact intensity (physical or non-physical) and gender (femalemale, male-female, male-male, female-female). Using a selection box, the user can opt to disable the assumption of reciprocity and participant weights by age and type of day. Finally, the user can enable reactive strategies such as school closure and increase the level of telework.

For reciprocal matrices and/or weighted matrices, the demography data and weights used are also displayed. If reactive strategies are selected, the effect in terms of R0, M and the relative incidence ratios are presented. All results can be downloaded as RData file.

For each country, we calculate contact rates between each age group after excluding data from holiday periods. We exclude compensation behavior if people do not go to work or school, to simulate quarantine-like scenarios. We fixed the reference proportion of telework at 5%, in line with European observations [Eurostat, 2020; https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/]. We analyse the change in transmission dynamics with 20%, 35% and 50% telework with and without school closure, based on earlier survey-based responses on the possibilities of employees to conduct their work activities remotely as teleworker [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]."

        "Results and Discussion": [
            "The http://www.socialcontactdata.org initiative, status 1 March 2020, includes data for Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland and the UK from the POLYMOD study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], as well as data from further studies of social mixing in France [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], Hong Kong [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], Peru [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], UK [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>], Russia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], Zimbabwe [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>], South Africa and Zambia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. All data are available on Zenodo [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>] and can be retrieved from within R using the socialmixr package. Survey details are provided in the systematic review of Hoang et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The data sets for France and Zimbabwe contain multiple days per participant, hence we selected the first day for each participant (to minimise the effect of reporting fatigue).",
            "The SOcial Contact RATES (Socrates) data tool enables quick and convenient generation of social contact matrices, relevant for the spread of infectious diseases. Figure 1 presents a screenshot of the user interface. The analysis of school closure and increasing the proportion of telework is only one demonstration of the potential uses of this platform. The options and potential of using social contact patterns to simulate infectious disease transmission seem endless, and we hope with this initiative to support data-driven modeling endeavours. We provide the source code via github.com/lwillem/.",
            "Figure 2 shows the effect of an increasing proportion of telework by country with and without school closure. For most countries, we predict a 10% decrease in the R0 with a telework proportion of 50%. In some countries, like China, Poland and Hong Kong, the reduction is slightly higher. The analysis for Peru shows little impact of telework. This can be explained by the observation of Grijalva et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] that participants reported few contacts at work whereas a substantial proportion of contacts was reported at the market or street. Cultural differences in how \u201cat work\u201d is understood should be taken into account when interpreting results.",
            "The effect of school closure is country-specific, e.g. 10% for Belgium and Vietnam, which appears to be similar in effect size to an increase in telework up to 50%. For other countries, e.g. Italy, Luxembourg and France, we predict school closure to decrease the R0 by 20%.",
            "The relative incidence, as presented in Figure 3, shows the impact of school closure compared to an increase in telework. The predicted relative incidence in people 18-60 years of age decreases with an increasing proportion of telework. That is, this measure provides some protection from exposure, which might be of interest if these age groups are more vulnerable compared to children, as is the case for COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. The relative incidence in the age group above 60 years of age increases in both situations compared to no intervention. This does not imply that the absolute number of cases in this age group would rise. This only means that the risk of infection in other age groups is more affected by the intervention (which reduces overall incidence) relative to their normal social contact behavior. Given that our intervention measures target only children and the population of working age, this observation is as expected."
        ],
        "Limitations": [
            "Most survey designs were derived from the POLYMOD survey design though each survey had additional features and objectives which could provide useful additional information. Therefore tools such as this one do not capture the full potential of each data set separately. The social contact analysis presented here focuses only on adapting school and work contacts. It does not capture compensation behavior due to not being at school or work, nor social distancing due to (pandemic) scares.",
            "Our estimates only account for adapted social contact patterns and do not account for age-specific differences in susceptibility or shedding. For example, assuming susceptibility and infectivity is lower for children, would imply that school closure as an intervention would have less impact whereas telework would have a larger impact. Our estimates also do not take into account travel restrictions or cancellation of public events, both of which may well have a large impact.",
            "The application contains a local version of each data set, with some additional data reformatting, though our future aim is to add an option to directly use data from the Zenodo repository. Note that other social contact surveys are available on Zenodo, though we have not yet included those surveys because they have a different set up. For example, in studies from China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] and the UK [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] groups of contacts instead of unique records were recorded and only infants were recruited, respectively. In contrast, data from Zambia and South Africa had almost no information for individuals aged 0-18",
            "years of age, and data from Zimbabwe did not include location. Therefore these data were omitted here."
