            "Sample collection. Human samples, including oral swabs, anal swabs, blood, and<br/><br/>BALF samples were collected by Jinyintan hospital (Wuhan) with the consent from all patients. Patients were sampled without gender or age preference unless where indicated. For swabs, 1.5 ml DMEM+2% FBS medium was added each tube.<br/><br/>Supernatant was collected after 2500 rpm, 60 s vortex and 15-30 min standing.<br/><br/>Supernatant from swabs or BALF (no pretreatment) was added to either lysis buffer for RNA extraction or to viral transport medium (VTM) for virus isolation. VTM composed of Hank's balanced salt solution at pH7.4 containing BSA (1%), amphotericin (15 \u03bcg/ml), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/ml).<br/><br/>Serum was separated by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 15 min within 24 h of collection, followed by 56 0C 30 min inactivation, and then stored at 4 0C until use.<br/><br/>Virus isolation, cell infection, electron microscope and neutralization assay. The following cells were used for virus isolation in this study: Vero, Vero E6, and Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] that were cultured in DMEM +10% FBS. A list of cells were used for susceptibility test (Extended Data Fig. 6). All cell lines were tested free of mycoplasma contamination, applied to species identification and authenticated by microscopic morphologic evaluation. None of cell lines was on the list of commonly misidentified cell lines (by ICLAC).<br/><br/>Cultured cell monolayers were maintained in their respective medium. PCR-positive<br/><br/>BALF sample from ICU-06 patient was spin at 8,000 g for 15 min, filtered and diluted 1:2 with DMEM supplied with 16 \u03bcg/ml trypsin before adding to cells. After incubation at 37 0C for 1 h, the inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh culture medium containing antibiotics (below) and 16 \u03bcg/ml trypsin. The cells were incubated at 37 0C and observed daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). The culture supernatant was examined for presence of virus by qRT-PCR developed in this study, and cells were examined by immunofluorescent using SARSr-CoV Rp3 NP antibody made in house (1:100). Penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (15 \u03bcg/ml) were included in all tissue culture media.<br/><br/>The Vero E6 cells were infected with new virus at MOI of 0.5 and harvested 48 hpi.<br/><br/>Cells were fixed with 2.5% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide, and then dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol concentrations (from 30 to 100%), and embedded with epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) of embedded cells were prepared, deposited onto Formvar-coated copper grids (200 mesh), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, then observed under 200 kV Tecnai G2 electron microscope.<br/><br/>The virus neutralization test was carried out in a 48-well plate. The patient serum samples were heat-inactivated by incubation at 56 0C for 30 min before use. The serum samples (5 \u03bcL) were diluted to 1:10, 1:20, 1:40 or 1:80, and then an equal volume of virus stock was added and incubated at 37 0C for 60 min in a 5% CO2 incubator. Diluted horse anti SARS-CoV serum or serum samples from healthy people were used as control. After incubation, 100 \u03bcL mixtures were inoculated onto monolayer Vero E6 cells in a 48-well plate for 1 hour. Each serum were repeated triplicate. After removing the supernatant, the plate was washed twice with DMEM medium. Cells were incubated with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for 24 hours.<br/><br/>Then the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. And the virus were detected using<br/><br/>SL-CoV Rp3 NP antibody followed by Cy3-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Infected cell number was counted by high-content cytometers.<br/><br/>RNA extraction and PCR. Whenever commercial kits were used, manufacturer\u2019s instructions were followed without modification. RNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcl of samples with the High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche). RNA was eluted in 50 \u03bcl of elution buffer and used as the template for RT-PCR.<br/><br/>For qPCR analysis, primers based on nCoV-2019 S gene was designed: RBD-qF1: 5\u2019-<br/><br/>CAATGGTTTAACAGGCACAGG-3\u2019; RBD-qR1: 5\u2019-<br/><br/>CTCAAGTGTCTGTGGATCACG-3\u2019. RNA extracted from above used in qPCR by<br/><br/>HiScript\u00ae II One Step qRT-PCR SYBR\u00ae Green Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co.,Ltd).<br/><br/>Conventional PCR test was also performed using the following primer pairs: ND-<br/><br/>CoVs-951F TGTKAGRTTYCCTAAYATTAC; ND-CoVs-1805R<br/><br/>ACATCYTGATANARAACAGC13. The 20 \u03bcl qPCR reaction mix contained 10 \u03bcl 2\u00d7<br/><br/>One Step SYBR Green Mix, 1 \u03bcl One Step SYBR Green Enzyme Mix, 0.4 \u03bcl 50 \u00d7<br/><br/>ROX Reference Dye 1, 0.4 \u03bcl of each primer (10 uM) and 2 \u03bcl template RNA.<br/><br/>Amplification was performed as follows: 50 0C for 3 min, 95 0C for 30 s followed by cycles consisting of 95 0C for 10 s, 60 0C for 30 s, and a default melting curve step in an ABI 7700 machine.<br/><br/>Serological test. In-house anti-SARSr-CoV IgG and IgM ELISA kits were developed using SARSr-CoV Rp3 NP as antigen, which shared above 90% amino acid identity to all SARSr-CoVs2. For IgG test, MaxiSorp Nunc-immuno 96 well ELISA plates were coated (100 ng/well) overnight with recombinant NP. Human sera were used at<br/><br/>1:20 dilution for 1 h at 37 0C. An anti-Human IgG-HRP conjugated monoclonal antibody (Kyab Biotech Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) was used at a dilution of 1:40000.<br/><br/>The OD value (450\u2013630) was calculated. For IgM test, MaxiSorp Nunc-immuno 96<br/><br/>wellELISA plates were coated (500 ng/well) overnight with anti-human IgM (\u03bc chain). Human sera were used at 1:100 dilution for 40 min at 37 0C, followed by anti-<br/><br/>Rp3 NP-HRP conjugated (Kyab Biotech Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) at a dilution of<br/><br/>1:4000. The OD value (450\u2013630) was calculated.<br/><br/>Examination of ACE2 receptor for nCoV-2019 infection. HeLa cells transiently expressing ACE2 were prepared by a lipofectamine 3000 system (Thermo Fisher<br/><br/>Scientific) in 96-well plate, with mock-transfected cells as controls. nCoV-2019 grown from Vero E6 cells was used for infection at multiplicity of infection 0.05.<br/><br/>Same for testing of APN and DPP4. The inoculum was removed after 1 h absorption and washed twice with PBS and supplemented with medium. At 24 hpi, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 20 min at room temperature. ACE2 expression was detected using mouse anti-S tag monoclonal antibody followed by FITC-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG H&L (Abcam, ab96879).<br/><br/>Viral replication was detected using rabbit antibody against the Rp3 NP protein (made in house, 1:100) followed by cyanin 3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50, Abcam, ab6939). Nucleus was stained with DAPI (Beyotime). Staining patterns were examined using the FV1200 confocal microscopy (Olympus).<br/><br/>High throughput sequencing, pathogen screening and genome assembly. Samples from patient BALF or from virus culture supernatant were used for RNA extraction and next-generation sequencing using Illumina MiSeq 3000 sequencer. Metagenomic analysis was carried out mainly base on the bioinformatics platform MGmapper (PE_2.24 and SE_2.24). The raw NGS reads were firstly processed by Cutadapt (v1.18) with minimum read length of 30bp. BWA (v0.7.12-r1039) was utilized to align reads to local database with a filter hits parameter at 0.8 FMM value and minimum alignment score at 30. Parameters for post-processing of assigned reads was set with minimum size normalized abundance at 0.01, minimum read count at 20 and other default parameters. A local nucleic acid database for human and mammals was employed to filter reads of host genomes before mapping reads to virus database. The results of metagenomic analysis were displayed through pie charts using WPS Office<br/><br/>2010. NGS reads were assembled into genomes using Geneious (v11.0.3) and<br/><br/>MEGAHIT (v1.2.9). PCR and Sanger sequencing was performed to fill gaps in the genome. 5\u2019-RACE was performed to determine the 5\u2019-end of the genomes using<br/><br/>SMARTer RACE 5\u2019/3\u2019 Kit (Takara). Genomes were annotated using Clone Manager<br/><br/>Professional Suite 8 (Sci-Ed Software).<br/><br/>Phylogenetic analysis. Routine sequence management and analysis was carried out using DNAStar. Sequence alignment and editing were conducted using ClustalW and<br/><br/>GeneDoc. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic trees based on nucleotide sequences of full-length ORF1b and S genes were constructed using the Jukes-Cantor model with bootstrap values determined by 1000 replicates in the MEGA6 software package."

            "Since the SARS outbreak 18 years ago, a large number of severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Previous studies indicated that some of those bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans, in Wuhan, China.",
            "The epidemic, started from December 12th, 2019, has caused 198 laboratory confirmed infections with three fatal cases by January 20th, 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at the early stage of the outbreak. They are almost identical to each other and share 79.5% sequence identify to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was found that nCoV-2019 is 96%",
            "identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus. The pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.
