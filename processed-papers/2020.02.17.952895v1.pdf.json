It is made available under a CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license. Research in context Evidence before this study The response to the recent epidemic of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, now named SARS-CoV2, and its disease named COVID-2019, require elucidating the possible origin, gene functions and potential treatment options. The genome sequence released for SARS-CoV-2 is a key resource to these efforts. We used all available whole-virus genomes released for the Betacoronavirus to conduct a functional pangenomic analysis of these viruses, including that of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 was previously reported in publications as 2019-nCoV. NCBI produced a dedicated resource for SARS-CoV-2 related publications and sequence data (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/SARS-CoV-2-seqs/). We searched this resource for terms \u201c2019-nCoV AND envelope\u201d (1 hit), or \u201c2019-nCoV AND orf10\u201d (0 hits) or \u201c2019-nCoV pangenome\u201d (0 hits) to find any published work related to these genes in SARS-CoV-2. We retrieved all Betacoronavirus (taxon id 694002) whole genome sequences from NCBI (January 26, 2020 from web page https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly) using the search term \u201ctxid694002[Organism:exp]\u201d. This search retrieved a total of 22 whole genomes, of which 18 were unique genomes, including 4 that for SARS-CoV-2, see supplementary table 1. Added value of this study We report and make available an interactive pangenome analysis resource (defining core and accessory genome components) for the genus Betacoronavirus (https://pangenomedb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa), including SARS-CoV-2. We identify and define all core and accessory gene alignments and phylogenetic trees for this genus. We then explore these data to provide insights into potential functions for uncharacterized genes (ORFs 6,8,10) unique to SARS-like coronaviruses, and suggest potential options for detection and therapy of COVID2019. This analysis points at protein E, highly conserved across all SARS-like coronaviruses, as a promising candidate for COVID-2019 detection and therapy. Implications of all the available evidence The Betacoronavirus pangenome data we made public allows exploration of core and accessory elements of these viruses to understand the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, thereby expediting progress in responding to the pandemic. The characterization and functional assessment of SARS-CoV-2 envelope, E, protein, in gene cluster 6 together with previous findings on this protein for SARS, leads us to recommend that detection of COVID-2019 be developed based on the SARS-CoV-2 E protein and that treatment using mutated SARS-Cov-2 lacking the E protein be explored as a promising candidate for a vaccine."

            "Recent epidemic of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a rising global health emergency (WHO https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). Three major actions, confinement, detection and therapy, are required to contain this pandemic.<br/><br/>Detection and therapy can be guided by virus sequence data, which was first made available in 17<br/><br/>December, 2019 at gsaid.org, soon after detection of the first cases. This SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data is a pivotal resource on its own, but can gain greater value when embedded with those of other Betacoronavirus, allowing a comparative pangenomic analysis. This approach can help identify the core genome of Betacoronaviruses and extract accessory genomic features shared by a subset of these viruses or unique to SARS-CoV-2. Whereas core genomic features are required for the virus to be functional, accessory features are candidates to provide insights into the drivers of the unique capacities of SARS-CoV-2 explaining its spread and virulence. Genome annotation can then be used to assess the possible functions of these accessory features and guide approaches to detection and treatment.<br/><br/>Here we apply a comparative pangenomic approach of all Betacoronavirus genomes sequenced thus far to detect the core and accessory gene cluster of this genus, and then annotate the functions, further assessed through structural analysis and predict the potential location in the host cell of those accessory gene clusters present in SARS-CoV-2 that were uncharacterized to-date. The core gene clusters were then aligned to obtain SNPs allowing us to generate a phylogenetic tree of<br/><br/>Betacoronavirus, providing insight into its likely evolutionary origin. Whole-genome sequence similarity analysis was then used to compare SARS-CoV-2 with phylogenetically close relatives from Betacoronavirus to further detect the regions of dissimilarity that may explain the distinct virulence of SARS-CoV-2, and to suggest targets for detection and therapy."

            "The Betacoronavirus genomes available from NCBI (accessed 26 January, 2020) included 23 assemblies corresponding to 18 different strains, ranging in size from 29.9 to 31.5 Kb (Suppl.<br/><br/>Table 1). About 10% of the gene clusters (4 out of 37) defined by panX 1 were present across all genomes, thereby defining the core genome for the genus Betacoronavirus (Fig. 1A). A species tree constructed based on SNPs in the genes related to core-genome gene clusters from<br/><br/>Betacoronaviruses showed that the recently detected SARS-CoV-2 appears closest to the bat coronavirus, bat-SL-CoVZC45, followed by Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)<br/><br/>coronavirus (Fig. 1B).<br/><br/>From the accessory genome, we found 6 accessory gene clusters (18 % of the accessory genome of genus Betacoronavirus) common to SARS-like coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, out of total accessory gene clusters. Four of these gene clusters (ORF3, ORF6, ORF7, and ORF8, Fig. 1A), appear only in SARS-CoV-2, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and the SARS virus. A gene cluster, annotated as ORF10, appears to be unique to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1). However, a blast-based search of this putative protein against the DNA of all sequences in NCBI\u2019s NT database, shows this sequence to match with 100% coverage in the DNA of other SARS-like genomes, but there is no open-reading frame predicted for those genomes in the matching (Fig 1A). This suggests that this apparent uniqueness of ORF10 is a possible annotation artifact, for the SARS-CoV-2 genome or the annotation pipeline of GeneBank did not predict a gene for other matching genomes. An additional accessory gene cluster for envelope protein, E (cluster 6 with 7 strains) is found in the<br/><br/>SARS, SARS-CoV-2, bat-SL-CoVZC45 as well as in Bat Hp-betacoronavirus/Zhejiang2013, and here Bat Hp-betacoronavirus/Zhejiang2013 appears to be a parental clade in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B). There are two other and different envelope protein clusters (clusters 5 with 13 strains, cluster 22 with 2 strains) but none of these include SARS-like genomes that have been involved in human pandemics. SARS envelope protein (also present in our gene cluster 6) has been studied previously and shown to be involved in critical aspects of the viral life cycle (such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis) and that CoVs lacking E make promising vaccine candidates[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].<br/><br/>Among the gene clusters unique to the SARS clade, including SARS-CoV-2, only cluster 6, related to E protein, is well annotated. Others gene clusters (ORF3, ORF6, ORF7, ORF8 and ORF10)<br/><br/>appear to be uncharacterized according to existing<br/><br/>GenBank annotations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/proteins/86693?genome_assembly_id=760344).<br/><br/>Reannotation of proteins from all available Betacoronavirus genomes through KAUST metagenomic analysis platform (KMAP, www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/kmap, project 46) provided functional insights for five out of six accessory gene clusters present in SARS-CoV-2. These five clusters are now labelled with Protein Family (PFAM) domain IDs, as shown in Fig 1A. Two of these previously characterized gene clusters (ORF3a and ORF7a Fig 1A) appear to have a common function related to inducing apoptosis (cell death, see http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF11289 and http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF08779). Among other functions, ORF3a, also known as viroporin, modulates virus release and upregulates fibrinogen in host cells 3. ORF7a seems to have immunoglobulin-like fold, which suggests ligand binding activity, possibly to integrin I domains<br/><br/>. The remaining three accessory gene clusters, ORF6, ORF8 and ORF10, present in SARS-CoV2, SARS and bat-SL-CoVZC45 remain functionally uncharacterized. In the following section we provide results of function prediction using DeepGOPlus 5 and using several protein structural analyses.<br/><br/>Before using DeepGOPlus 5 to explore uncharacterized gene clusters further, we first tested its GO terms assignment for the well characterized envelope protein. As shown in Supplementary Fig 1, DeepGOPlus is able to assign functions such as interaction with host cell, virion assembly, budding, host cell disruption. Similar functions were described for SARS E protein previously[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] that differs from SARS-CoV-2 E protein for a single amino acid substitution and an insertion.<br/><br/>DeepGOPlus also predicted localization of the E protein function in the host cell to be associated with the Golgi apparatus, vacuoles, endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane cell periphery of the host cell. DeepGOPlus predicts a role for ORF6 in the regulation of molecular function, cellular component biogenesis and organization with potential cellular localization in membrane-forming protein complexes (Suppl. Figure 2). GO for ORF8 predicts potential functions as response to stimulus along with biological regulation with potential cellular localization in vacuoles, cell periphery and extracellular regions (Suppl. Figure 3). For the smallest protein ORF10, DeepGOPlus predicts a role as regulator of molecular function and response to stimulus, similar to ORF8, but is predicted to be localized only in the extracellular region of the host cell (Suppl.    Figure 4).<br/><br/>Our bioinformatic structural assessment showed that the structural architecture of protein E (a homopentameric single-pass transmembrane ion channel) is conserved compared to the 95%<br/><br/>identical protein E from other SARS-CoV (Supplementary Figures 5,6). ORF3a displayed a multipass transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic b-barrel or b-sandwich fold (Supplementary"

            "The comparative analysis of available Betacoronavirus genomes reported here helped us to identify the unique and shared features of SARS-CoV-2 virus and provided insights into its virulence while also providing guidance for their rapid detection and possible therapy. A comparative genomic analysis at a larger scale, including alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses, identified substitutions in specific amino acids among severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or SARS-like coronaviruses 7, potentially leading to functional and pathogenic divergence in SARS-CoV-2. We complement this effort through a pan-genomic approach focused on functional similarities and annotation, rather than amino acid substitution. Our analysis provides a unique, user-friendly and interactive resource (https://pangenomedb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa) of core and accessory gene clusters from the genus Betacoronavirus that sheds light on potential function of uncharacterized genes unique to SARS-like coronaviruses. Another recent study 8 described one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate genome from Wuhan and discussed phylogenetic analysis of its genes in context of comparison to Betacoronavirus genus, although protein E was not described in detail. Furthermore, in our Markov Chain Clustering (MCL), SARS ORF7, ORF8 and ORF11 (gene symbols taken from GenBank annotation file for accession AY274119) are clustering with ORF6, ORF7 and ORF8, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2. The conservation of<br/><br/>ORF11 from SARS with ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 is however weak, all alignments are available at our Betacoronavirus pangenome database.<br/><br/>Our analysis suggests no major function or gene cluster to be unique only to SARS-CoV-2, as the unique gene cluster related to ORF10 identified is not robust and likely to be an annotation artifact since TBLASTN of this protein finds matches with 100% coverage in all SARS-like genomes. The spike protein present in SARS-CoV-2, a replicase that is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and two proteases in coronavirus (namely proteinase (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro) have been proposed as therapeutic targets for possible treatments for SARS-CoV-2 9. The similarity of the spike protein between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS shown here implies that SARS antiviral drugs would also be effective in blocking the binding of SARSCoV-2 spike protein to human host cells 10. However, a recent study notes that some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, targeting human receptor ACE2, failed to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.28.923011). These results suggest that new antibodies that bind specifically to the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) need be developed. Our analysis provided potential functions for four previously uncharacterized accessory gene clusters (ORF3, 6, 7 and 8), which provide valuable novel insights into the function of the SARS clade, including SARS-CoV-2.<br/><br/>The assessment of gene clusters provided here suggests that one of the accessory gene clusters, cluster 6 (Fig 1A), present in SARS-CoV-2, the E envelope protein, may be of potential interest as a target for both SARS-CoV-2 detection and vaccine development. E-protein based detection has already been used for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, applying RT-PCR for this envelope protein, successfully reconfirming positive cases and allowing estimates of viral loads in carriers 11,12. A few studies have investigated the potential of vaccines based on either virus with mutated E protein or lacking E protein altogether, specifically focusing on SARS- and MERS-CoV. This approach, which resulted in robust immune responses in animal models for SARS- and MERS-CoV 2, together with our results, show the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 to be critical for both detection and therapy. Specifically, we suggest that a vaccine based on SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the E protein could be effective in inducing robust immune responses against this novel virus."

This approach can help identify the core genome of Betacoronaviruses and extract accessory genomic features shared by a subset of these viruses or unique to SARS-CoV-2. Whereas core genomic features are required for the virus to be functional, accessory features are candidates to provide insights into the drivers of the unique capacities of SARS-CoV-2 explaining its spread and virulence. Genome annotation can then be used to assess the possible functions of these accessory features and guide approaches to detection and treatment.",

Four of these gene clusters (ORF3, ORF6, ORF7, and ORF8, Fig. 1A), appear only in SARS-CoV-2, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and the SARS virus. A gene cluster, annotated as ORF10, appears to be unique to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1).

        "Discussion": [
            "The comparative analysis of available Betacoronavirus genomes reported here helped us to identify the unique and shared features of SARS-CoV-2 virus and provided insights into its virulence while also providing guidance for their rapid detection and possible therapy. A comparative genomic analysis at a larger scale, including alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses, identified substitutions in specific amino acids among severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or SARS-like coronaviruses 7, potentially leading to functional and pathogenic divergence in SARS-CoV-2. We complement this effort through a pan-genomic approach focused on functional similarities and annotation, rather than amino acid substitution. Our analysis provides a unique, user-friendly and interactive resource (https://pangenomedb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa) of core and accessory gene clusters from the genus Betacoronavirus that sheds light on potential function of uncharacterized genes unique to SARS-like coronaviruses. Another recent study 8 described one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate genome from Wuhan and discussed phylogenetic analysis of its genes in context of comparison to Betacoronavirus genus, although protein E was not described in detail. Furthermore, in our Markov Chain Clustering (MCL), SARS ORF7, ORF8 and ORF11 (gene symbols taken from GenBank annotation file for accession AY274119) are clustering with ORF6, ORF7 and ORF8, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2. The conservation of",
            "ORF11 from SARS with ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 is however weak, all alignments are available at our Betacoronavirus pangenome database.",
            "Our analysis suggests no major function or gene cluster to be unique only to SARS-CoV-2, as the unique gene cluster related to ORF10 identified is not robust and likely to be an annotation artifact since TBLASTN of this protein finds matches with 100% coverage in all SARS-like genomes. The spike protein present in SARS-CoV-2, a replicase that is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and two proteases in coronavirus (namely proteinase (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro) have been proposed as therapeutic targets for possible treatments for SARS-CoV-2 9. The similarity of the spike protein between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS shown here implies that SARS antiviral drugs would also be effective in blocking the binding of SARSCoV-2 spike protein to human host cells 10. However, a recent study notes that some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, targeting human receptor ACE2, failed to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.28.923011). These results suggest that new antibodies that bind specifically to the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) need be developed. Our analysis provided potential functions for four previously uncharacterized accessory gene clusters (ORF3, 6, 7 and 8), which provide valuable novel insights into the function of the SARS clade, including SARS-CoV-2.",
            "The assessment of gene clusters provided here suggests that one of the accessory gene clusters, cluster 6 (Fig 1A), present in SARS-CoV-2, the E envelope protein, may be of potential interest as a target for both SARS-CoV-2 detection and vaccine development. E-protein based detection has already been used for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, applying RT-PCR for this envelope protein, successfully reconfirming positive cases and allowing estimates of viral loads in carriers 11,12. A few studies have investigated the potential of vaccines based on either virus with mutated E protein or lacking E protein altogether, specifically focusing on SARS- and MERS-CoV. This approach, which resulted in robust immune responses in animal models for SARS- and MERS-CoV 2, together with our results, show the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 to be critical for both detection and therapy. Specifically, we suggest that a vaccine based on SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the E protein could be effective in inducing robust immune responses against this novel virus."
