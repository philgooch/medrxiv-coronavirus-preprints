            "The pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unclear. Current evidences indicate that it can invade multiple organ systems, including the respiratory system, digestive system and hematological system[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. But whether it can invade the urinary system has not been reported. In our study, urine, blood, anal swab and oropharyngeal swab from 9 patients were retested by qRT-PCR. It is the first time for the SARS-CoV-2 found in urine, though no urinary irritation was found. In addition, the quantity of the virus in the anal swab was closer to that of the oropharyngeal test, and those in the blood and urine were less than that of the oropharyngeal test, indicating that the \"clearing effect\" of the digestive tract on the virus is not obvious. Nevertheless, the relative symptoms, including diarrhea and urinary irritation did not happen to every patient with virus in anal swab and urine specimens. All samples were negative at the earliest time of the 10th day after onset in that mild patient. Therefore, we believed that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the urinary system, hematological system and digestive system other than the respiratory system, not always with relative symptoms. Mild patients can be self-limiting. This will prompt clinicians to pay attention to the clinical manifestations of multiple systems, even if the corresponding clinical symptoms do not appear. In addition, it is necessary to carry out multiple examinations of various specimens to assess changes in disease and prognosis."
