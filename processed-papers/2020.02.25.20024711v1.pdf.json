            "Patients and Data collection<br/><br/>To determine the ability of routine laboratory tests, measured at hospital admission, to differentiate NCIP from CAP due to other causes, we compared the hematological and biochemical data of NCIP patients and CAP patients. The 84 NCIP patients presented to our hospital from Dec 26, 2019, to Jan 30, 2020. The patients were laboratory confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR. The CAP group consisted of 316 patients who visited our hospital from January 2018 to December 2018. These patients had \u22652 symptoms and signs of CAP and had evidence of pneumonia revealed by the emergency department physician or internal medicine consultant. Healthy controls included 120 healthy people who made the physical check-up in our hospital from Dec 13, 2019, to Dec 17, 2019. The clinical data collection from patients was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission for emerging infectious diseases.<br/><br/>Hematological and serum biochemical examination<br/><br/>Routine hematological and serum biochemical examination was ordered at the discretion of the physicians and were measured using standard methods in our hospital. Fasting whole blood from every patient was collected in an EDTA anticoagulant-treated tube and analyzed within 30 minutes of collection. Routine peripheral blood cells, including hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and monocytes, were analyzed. Routine serum biochemical parameters, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), AST/ALT ratio, total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), unconjugated bilirubin (UBIL), total protein (TP), ALB, globulin (GLB), \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bile acid (TBA) were measured.<br/><br/>Statistical analysis<br/><br/>Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS version 22.0 software. Statistical analysis for the results was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for only two groups or using one-way analysis of variance when there were more than two groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Higher AUC were considered to show better discriminatory ability as follows: excellent, AUC of \u22650.90; good, 0.80 \u2264 AUC<0.90; fair, 0.70 \u2264 AUC< 0.80. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant."

        "results": [
            "Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone.",
            "The mean values of laboratory indexes at the time of hospital admission in NCIP patients and CAP patients were demonstrated in table 1 and figure 1. Both NCIP patients and CAP patients had lower mean lymphocyte counts and platelet counts than healthy control. NCIP patients had significantly lower mean values for WBC, neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet counts, and ALP than did patients with CAP. NCIP patients had significantly higher mean values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, ALB, ALT, and AST than did CAP patients. There were no significant differences in mean values of erythrocyte mean levels of globulin (GLB), \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and total bile acid (TBA) between NCIP patients and CAP patients.<br/><br/>The proportion of patients with abnormal laboratory features are presented in table 2. Both NCIP patients (81.0%) and CAP patients (59.5%) had lymphopenia. A significantly higher proportion of NCIP patients presented reduced WBC and eosinophil, normal basophile, and increased AST, whereas a significantly higher proportion of CAP patients had decrease of RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, ALB and increase of neutrophil, monocyte and RDW.<br/><br/>Multivariate analysis demonstrated the laboratory indexes independently discriminating NCIP from CAP. The OR of the factors to predict NCIP versus CAP were shown in table 3. The ROC curves and AUC (figures 2) demonstrated that RDW (AUC, 0.88) and HGB (AUC, 0.82) had good discriminatory ability. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Furthermore, the cutoff value for RDW could be 13.35 that provided a reasonable sensitivity (79.8%) or specificity (85.1%). When ROC curves were calculated for combinations of these three parameters, improvement in AUC was presented, with the maximum AUC being 0.90."

            "Background. The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP.",
            "Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability.",
            "Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone.",
            "Conclusions. Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of NCIP. Application of laboratory tests may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses."

            "To determine the ability of routine laboratory tests, measured at hospital admission, to differentiate NCIP from CAP due to other causes, we compared the hematological and biochemical data of NCIP patients and CAP patients. The 84 NCIP patients presented to our hospital from Dec 26, 2019, to Jan 30, 2020. The patients were laboratory confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR. The CAP group consisted of 316 patients who visited our hospital from January 2018 to December 2018. These patients had \u22652 symptoms and signs of CAP and had evidence of pneumonia revealed by the emergency department physician or internal medicine consultant. Healthy controls included 120 healthy people who made the physical check-up in our hospital from Dec 13, 2019, to Dec 17, 2019. The clinical data collection from patients was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission for emerging infectious diseases.",
            "Routine hematological and serum biochemical examination was ordered at the discretion of the physicians and were measured using standard methods in our hospital. Fasting whole blood from every patient was collected in an EDTA anticoagulant-treated tube and analyzed within 30 minutes of collection. Routine peripheral blood cells, including hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and monocytes, were analyzed. Routine serum biochemical parameters, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), AST/ALT ratio, total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), unconjugated bilirubin (UBIL), total protein (TP), ALB, globulin (GLB), \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bile acid (TBA) were measured.",
            "Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS version 22.0 software. Statistical analysis for the results was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for only two groups or using one-way analysis of variance when there were more than two groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Higher AUC were considered to show better discriminatory ability as follows: excellent, AUC of \u22650.90; good, 0.80 \u2264 AUC<0.90; fair, 0.70 \u2264 AUC< 0.80. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant."

        "Results": [
            "The mean values of laboratory indexes at the time of hospital admission in NCIP patients and CAP patients were demonstrated in table 1 and figure 1. Both NCIP patients and CAP patients had lower mean lymphocyte counts and platelet counts than healthy control. NCIP patients had significantly lower mean values for WBC, neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet counts, and ALP than did patients with CAP. NCIP patients had significantly higher mean values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, ALB, ALT, and AST than did CAP patients. There were no significant differences in mean values of erythrocyte mean levels of globulin (GLB), \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and total bile acid (TBA) between NCIP patients and CAP patients.",
            "The proportion of patients with abnormal laboratory features are presented in table 2. Both NCIP patients (81.0%) and CAP patients (59.5%) had lymphopenia. A significantly higher proportion of NCIP patients presented reduced WBC and eosinophil, normal basophile, and increased AST, whereas a significantly higher proportion of CAP patients had decrease of RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, ALB and increase of neutrophil, monocyte and RDW.",
            "Multivariate analysis demonstrated the laboratory indexes independently discriminating NCIP from CAP. The OR of the factors to predict NCIP versus CAP were shown in table 3. The ROC curves and AUC (figures 2) demonstrated that RDW (AUC, 0.88) and HGB (AUC, 0.82) had good discriminatory ability. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Furthermore, the cutoff value for RDW could be 13.35 that provided a reasonable sensitivity (79.8%) or specificity (85.1%). When ROC curves were calculated for combinations of these three parameters, improvement in AUC was presented, with the maximum AUC being 0.90."
