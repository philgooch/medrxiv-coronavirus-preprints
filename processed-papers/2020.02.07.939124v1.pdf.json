        "abstract": "Since its debut in mid-December, 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread from its origin in Wuhan, China, to several countries across the globe, leading to a global health crisis. As of February 7, 2020, 44 strains of the virus have been sequenced and uploaded to NCBI\u2019s GenBank [1], providing insight into the virus\u2019s evolutionary history and pathogenesis. Here, we present the WashU Virus Genome Browser, a web-based portal for viewing virus genomic data. The browser is home to 16 complete 2019-nCoV genome sequences, together with hundreds of related viral sequences including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus. In addition, the browser features unique customizability, supporting user-provided upload of novel viral sequences in various formats. Sequences can be viewed in both a track26 based representation as well as a phylogenetic tree-based view, allowing the user to easily compare sequence features across multiple strains. The WashU Virus Genome Browser inherited many features and track types from the WashU Epigenome Browser, and additionally incorporated a new type of SNV track to address the specific needs of viral research. Our Virus Browser portal can be accessed at https://virusgateway.wustl.edu, and documentation is available at https://virusgateway.readthedocs.io/.",

            "On December 12, 2019, the first case of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in<br/><br/>Wuhan, China, and by February 6, 2020, the virus spread to 24 additional countries, infecting more than 27,000 individuals and resulting in 565 fatalities, according to the World Health<br/><br/>Organization (WHO) [2]. The 2019-nCoV is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus, which is one of four genera of coronaviruses of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family<br/><br/>Coronaviridae, of the order Nidovirales [3, 4]. The species in this genus are enveloped, contain a positive single-stranded RNA genome, and are of zoonotic, likely bat, origins [5]. 2019-nCoV is one of the largest RNA virus genomes varying from 27kb to 32kb in size, with this particular strain ringing in at 29,903 bps long [6]. The virus is one of 7 coronaviruses known to infect humans, and along with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 2019-nCoV is one of the species responsible for severe respiratory distress in humans as well as other animals [4]. In an effort to better understand the pathogenesis of this family of viruses, several groups have sequenced individual strains, providing a powerful resource hosted by NCBI.<br/><br/>The WashU Epigenome Browser is a powerful tool for visualizing multiple functional genomic datasets and data types simultaneously [5-8]. The general layout of the Epigenome Browser displays the genome on the x-axis, and individual tracks encompassing many different varieties can be loaded and viewed in the context of the genome and accompanying metadata. Recent updates to the browser have incorporated new functionality, including live browsing, greatly enhancing its functionality [5]. With this powerful tool in-hand, we sought to adapt the browser for use of visualizing viral genomes, to support more efficient research and more rapid knowledge dissemination in response to the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak. To accomplish this, we created the WashU Virus Genome Browser, adapted from the WashU Epigenome Browser.<br/><br/>The Virus Genome Browser houses reference genomes for 2019-nCoV, MERS, SARS, and<br/><br/>Ebola virus, along with several annotation tracks including gene annotation, putative antibodybinding epitopes, CG density, and sequence diversity. Complete genomes of individual strains of each virus species (16, 551, 332, and 1574, respectively as of February 7, 2020, and periodically updated) are available as a database for instant viewing on the Virus Browser via multiple track types designed to display pairwise comparison to the references. Additionally, we aligned the genomes of all available strains in the database and generated a phylogenetic tree for each virus species that allows the user to directly select strains from the tree and view as tracks in the genomic display. In addition to all track types supported by the Epigenome<br/><br/>Browser, we designed a new SNV track type to display sequence variation. Users can upload their own alignment results from any aligner and display them as SNV tracks on the browser.<br/><br/>The functionality of the Virus Browser is not limited to the 4 species currently housed. Users can upload their own reference genome in FASTA format and display tracks in the context of the user-specified reference. While maintaining the same functionality as that of the Epigenome<br/><br/>Browser and providing novel functionality to aid specifically in viral genome research, we hope that the Virus Browser may facilitate research against new epidemic viruses."

            "Reference sequences, additional strains, and gene annotations: Genomic sequences of all viral strains were downloaded as FASTA files from NCBI [Supplementary Table 1]. All available sequences as of January 31, 2020, for 2019-nCoV, MERS, SARS, and Ebola were downloaded (n=16, 551, 332, and 1574, respectively). The reference genomic sequence of the selected virus (2019-nCoV: NC_045512.2; MERS: NC_019843.3; SARS: NC_004718.3, Ebola: KM034562.1) is automatically displayed as a color coded track when opening the genomic track browser viewing format. Genic annotations of reference genomes were downloaded as GFF3 files from NCBI and converted to refBed format for viewing on the browser.<br/><br/>author/funder. It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.<br/><br/>Sequence alignment and tree generation: The genomes of all individual strains of each virus were aligned to the reference genome using the pairwise alignment tool stretcher [9] with parameters \u201c-gapopen 16 -gapextend 4\u201d. To generate the phylogenetic trees, we used the MAFFT program, employing the fast option to align individual strains of each viral genome to its reference [10, 11]. Phylogenetic trees were built using FastTree with the GTR model [12, 13].<br/><br/>Data Tracks: Genome Comparison Track: We adopted the genome comparison tracks from the WashU Epigenome Browser. Any pairwise alignment results in markx3 or FASTA format can be converted with our publicly accessible script \u201caligned_fa_2_genomealign.py\u201d [14] and directly displayed as genome comparison tracks on the Virus Browser.<br/><br/>SNV Track: Congeneric (or Closely-related) Immune Epitope Locations: We wrote a text processing utility to import antibody-binding epitopes curated by the Immune<br/><br/>Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [15].<br/><br/>Subsequently, we used tblastn to align linear epitopes to the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (Taxonomy ID: 2697049; NCBI:txid2697049). We found 955 out of<br/><br/>2,817 linear epitopes identified in SARS had at least 1 \u201chit\u201d in the 2019-nCoV genome [Supplementary Data 1]. Three epitopes have 2 \u201chits\u201d each. However, the secondary hit is on the negative strand with very low percent identity (37.5% to 53.8%) to the 2019-nCoV genome and are hence filtered out as 2019-nCoV is a (+) ssRNA virus. Similarly, we found 1 hit out of 38 linear epitopes identified in MERS. We also provide scripts [14] that can be used to obtain a quick overview of the similarity of linear epitopes identified in other viruses in databases like<br/><br/>IEDB.

Variations from the reference genome, including mismatches and deletions, are displayed with customizable colors. Insertions compared to the reference genome can be expanded upon selecting to show the nucleotides inserted. When viewing large regions, such as the whole genome, it is not possible to display all individual variation events. Therefore, the frequency of variation events is also displayed in a \u201cdensity mode\u201d where a high value over a region signifies multiple sequence variation events within the region.<br/><br/>GC density tracks were created for each reference genome, displaying the percentage of G (guanine) and C (cytosine) bases in 5-bp windows.<br/><br/>In order to display a measure of sequence conservation across the genome, we calculated the percentage of each of the 4 nucleotides at each position in the genome across all strains for a given virus species. The resulting bed tracks display the percentages each nucleotide comprises across all strain for each genomic position. We also calculated Shannon entropy for each position along the genome using the percentages of each of the 4 nucleotides. A high<br/><br/>Shannon entropy at a position signifies that the 4 possible nucleotides are equally likely across all strains of this virus, and thus the position is likely divergent. A low Shannon entropy at a position means that the identity of the nucleotide at this position is highly conserved across all strains. The entropy() function of the R package \u201centropy\u201d was used for calculations.<br/><br/>Resources for User-Defined Bed and Categorical Tracks: In addition to our housed data tracks, we also offer scripts (\u201cpublicParseAlignment.py\u201d,<br/><br/>\u201cpublicAlignment.py\u201d, and \u201cpublicConvertMarkx3.py\u201d) to convert any markx3 or FASTAformatted alignment into displayable bed and categorical formats, and a script (\u201cpublicJsonGen.py\u201d) to generate a json file for uploading multiple data files together for display [https://github.com/debugpoint136/WashU-Virus-Genome-Browser].

            "Organization of the Virus Genome Browser<br/><br/>The WashU Virus Genome Browser houses consensus reference genomic sequences for 4 different pathogenic virus species: 2019-nCoV, MERS, SARS, and Ebola, as well as a comprehensive set of genome assemblies for the individual strains of each virus (16, 551, 332, and 1574, respectively). When users first navigate to the WashU Virus Browser and select \u201cBrowse Data\u201d, they are directed to a page with several customizable options, including a dropdown menu from which they may choose a reference genome [Figure 1]. Corresponding with the reference genome selected, a metadata table is displayed containing sortable features such as species, strain, isolate, isolation source, host, country, and collection date, to allow for quick and easy sorting of individual strains. The user may select viral isolates from the metadata table to be visualized in one of our two displayable platforms: the track view (green arrow, Figures 2 and 3) or the phylogenetic tree view (orange arrow, Figures 4 and 5).    The Track View<br/><br/>The track view option has a standard genome browser layout similar to that of the WashU<br/><br/>Epigenome Browser, in which a reference genome sequence is visualized as a sliding window.<br/><br/>Various annotation data tracks are hosted on the browser and can be loaded for visualization in a genomic context. For each virus, we downloaded publicly available annotations of the reference genome and converted these annotations into refBed tracks that can be visualized in the genome browser. Likewise, immune epitopes identified in SARS were aligned to the 2019nCoV reference [Materials and Methods], and a track displaying their coordinates in 2019-nCoV is provided. GC-density tracks were also created for each reference genome, and display the percentage of Gs (Guanines) and Cs (Cytosines) per 5bp window. An entropy track [Materials and Methods] showing the degree of sequence diversity at each position and a diversity track [Materials and Methods] showing the percentage of each of the 4 nucleotides at each position across all strains of the given virus species are also included in the database. In addition to hosting 4 virus species reference genomes, The Virus Genome Browser also supports displaying user-specified genomes provided in FASTA format, as shown in the top left part of<br/><br/>Figure 2A, under the browser logo.<br/><br/>The WashU Virus Browser supports a \u201czoomed-out\u201d view of the entire viral genome.

Recent updates to the browser have incorporated new functionality, including live browsing, greatly enhancing its functionality [5]. With this powerful tool in-hand, we sought to adapt the browser for use of visualizing viral genomes, to support more efficient research and more rapid knowledge dissemination in response to the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak.
