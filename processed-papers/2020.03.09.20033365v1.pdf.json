        "abstract": "Analysis of genetic sequence data from the pandemic SARS Coronavirus 2 can provide insights into epidemic origins, worldwide dispersal, and epidemiological history. With few exceptions, genomic epidemiological analysis has focused on geographically distributed data sets with few isolates in any given location. Here we report an analysis of 20 whole SARS-CoV 2 genomes from a single relatively small and geographically constrained outbreak in Weifang, People\u2019s Republic of China. Using Bayesian model-based phylodynamic methods, we estimate the reproduction number for the outbreak to be 1.99(95% CI:1.48-3.14). We further estimate the number of infections through time and compare these estimates to confirmed diagnoses by the Weifang Centers for Disease Control. We find that these estimates are consistent with reported cases and there is unlikely to be a large undiagnosed burden of infection over the period we studied.",

            "We report a genomic epidemiological analysis of one of the first geographically concentrated community transmission samples of SARS-CoV 2 genetic sequences collected outside of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China. These data comprise 20 whole genome sequences from confirmed<br/><br/>COVID19 infections in Weifang, Shandong Province, People\u2019s Republic of China. The data were collected over the course of several weeks up to February 10, 2020 and overlap with a period of intensifying public health and social distancing measures. Phylodynamic analysis allows us to evaluate epidemiological trends after seeding events which took place in mid to late January, 2020.<br/><br/>The objective of our analysis is to evaluate epidemiological trends based on national surveillance and response efforts by Weifang Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This analysis provides an estimate of the initial rate of spread and reproduction number in Weifang City. In contrast to the early spread of COVID19 in Hubei Province of China, most community transmissions within Weifang took place after public health interventions and social distancing measures were put in place. We therefore hypothesize that genetic data should reflect a lower growth rate and reproduction number than was observed in Wuhan. A secondary aim is to estimate the total numbers infected and to evaluate the possibility that there is a large unmeasured burden of infection due to imperfect case ascertainment and a large proportion of infections with mild or asymptomatic illness.<br/><br/>To analyze the Weifang sequences, we have adapted model-based phylodynamic methods which were previously used to estimate growth rates and reproduction numbers using sequence data from Wuhan and exported international cases(Volz et al, 2020). This analysis has several constraints and requirements: Importation of lineages from Wuhan. The outbreak in Weifang was seeded by multiple lineages imported at various times from the rest of China. We use a phylodynamic model that accounts for location of sampling. Migration is modeled as a bi-directional process with rates proportional to epidemic size in Weifang. The larger international reservoir of COVID19 cases serves as a source of new infections and is assumed to be growing exponentially over this period of time.<br/><br/>Nonlinear epidemiological dynamics in Weifang. The maximum number of daily confirmed COVID19 cases occurred on February 5, but it is unknown when the maximum prevalence of infection occurred. We use a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKeeling_2011_a\" href=\"#rKeeling_2011_a\">Keeling and Rohani, 2011</a>)<br/><br/>for epidemic dynamics in Weifang. The model accounts for a realistic distribution of generation times and can potentially capture a nonlinear decrease in cases following epidemic peak.<br/><br/>Variance in transmission rates(Lloyd-Smith et al, 2005).To estimate total numbers infected, the phylodynamic model must account for epidemiological variables which are known to significantly influence genetic diversity. Foremost among these is the variance in offspring distribution (number of transmissions per primary case). We draw on previous evidence based on the previous SARS epidemic which indicates that the offspring distribution is highly over-dispersed. High variance of transmission rates will reduce genetic diversity of a sample and failure to account for this factor will lead to highly biased estimates of epidemic size(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2017_a\">Li et al, 2017</a>). Recent analyses of sequence data drawn primarily from Wuhan has found that high over-dispersion was required for estimated cases to be consistent with the epidemiological record(Volz et al, 2020). Models assuming low variance in transmission rates between people would generate estimates of cases that are lower than the known number of confirmed cases. Separately, Grantz et al(Grantz et al, ????) have author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.<br/><br/>found that high over-dispersion is required to reconcile estimated reproduction numbers with the observed frequency of international outbreaks. In this study, we elaborate the SEIR model to include a compartment(J ) with higher transmission rates. The variance of the implied offspring distribution is calibrated to give similar overdispersion from the SARS epidemic."

            "Despite an initial rapid increase in confirmed cases in Weifang in late January and early February, the number of confirmed cases by Weifang CDC show that outbreak peaked quite early and maximum number of cases ocurred on February 5. Phylodynamic analysis supports the interpretation that control efforts reduced epidemic growth rates and contributed to eventual control. Figure 1A shows the estimated time scaled phylogeny (maximum clade credibility) including 20 lineages sampled from distinct patients in Weifang and 33 genomes sampled from Wuhan and internationally.<br/><br/>Figure 1B illustrates the phylodynamic model which was co-estimated with the phylogeny which provides estimates of epidemiological parameters summarized in Table 1.<br/><br/>The estimated number of infections is shown Figure 1C. The time series of confirmed cases should lag the estimated number of infected because of delays from infection to appearance of symptoms and delays from symptoms to diagnosis. We also expect that an unknown proportion of infections will be missed by the surveillance system due very mild, subclinical, or asymptomatic infection. Our estimates do not support the hypothesis that there was a very large hidden burden of infection in Weifang over the period that the sequence data were sampled. Indeed, our central estimate for the number infected on 10th February is 53, which is only slightly in excess of the 44 cumulative confirmed cases at the end of February.    Parameter    Prior    Posterior mean    95% HPD    Initial infected<br/><br/>Exponential(mean=1)<br/><br/>Log-normal(mean log=6, sd log=1)<br/><br/>Exponential(mean=10)<br/><br/>Log-normal(mean log=1.03, sd log =0.5)<br/><br/>Uniform(0.0007,0.003)<br/><br/>Transition/transversion<br/><br/>Log-normal(mean log=1,sd log=1.25)    Gamma shape<br/><br/>Initial susceptible    Migration rate<br/><br/>Reproduction number<br/><br/>Molecular clock rate<br/><br/>Units: Migrations per lineage per year.<br/><br/>Units: Substitutions per site per year.<br/><br/>While we do not have sufficient data to detect a large decrease in epidemic growth rates as the epidemic progressed, we do find that the growth rates are somewhat lower than estimated in other settings and during the early epidemic in Wuhan. We estimate R0 = 1.99 (95% HPD:1.48-3.14) and the growth rate in cases was approximately 6% per day. The relatively low value of R0 corresponds to growth during a period when Weifang was implementing a variety of public health interventions (points) reported by Weifan CDC. The shaded region shows the 95% HPD and the line shows the posterior median. D. A root to tip regression showing approximately linear increase in diversity with time of sampling.<br/><br/>and contact tracing to limit epidemic spread. These interventions included public health messaging, establishing phone hotlines, encouraging home isolation for recent vitors from Wuhan (January<br/><br/>23-26), optimizing triage of suspected cases in hospitals (January 24), travel restrictions(January 26), extending school closures, and establishing \u2018fever clinics\u2019 for consulatation and diagnosis(January    27)(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMao_2020_a\" href=\"#rMao_2020_a\">Mao, 2020</a>).<br/><br/>As well as providing novel epidemiological estimates, our results point to the significance of realistic modeling for fidelity of phylogenetic inference. The use of a model-based structured coalescent prior had large influence over estimated molecular clock rates and inferred TMRCAs. Figure<br/><br/>Supplement 1 shows that maximum likelihood inference of time-scaled phylogenies produces a distribution of TMRCAs which are substantially different than the Bayesian model-based analysis.<br/><br/>Choice of population genetic prior will have a large influence on phylogenetic inference based on sparse or poorly informative genetic sequence data. Among the 20 Weifang sequences included in this analysis, there is mean pairwise difference of only three single nucleotide polymorphisms and only approximately twice as much diversity observed among the remainder of the sequences we studied. There is correspondingly low confidence in tree topology (Figure Supplement 2), and only three clades had greater than 50% posterior support including one clade which had a monophyletic compoisition of 13 Weifang lineages. The earliest Weifang sequence was sampled on January 25 from a patient who showed first symptoms on January 16. These dates cover a similar range as the posterior TMRCA of all Weifang sequences (Figure Supplement 3)."

        "discussion": [
            "Our analysis of 20 SARS-CoV 2 genomes from Weifang, China has confirmed independent observations regarding the rate of spread and burden of infection in the city. Surveillance of COVID19 is rendered difficult by high proportions of illness with mild severity and an unknown proportion of asymptomatic infection(Guan et al, 2020). The extent of under-reporting and case ascertainment rates has been widely debated. Analysis of genetic sequence data provides an alternative source of information about epidemic size which can be more robust to imperfect case ascertainment.

As of 10 February 2020, 136 suspected cases, and 214 close contacts were diagnosed by Weifang Center for Disease Control and<br/><br/>Prevention. 28 cases were detected positive with SARS-CoV-2. Viral RNA was extracted using Maxwell<br/><br/>Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Promega AS1150) by magnetic bead method and RNeasy<br/><br/>Mini Kit (QIAGEN 74104) by column method. RT-qPCR was carried out using 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China) to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral<br/><br/>RNA with cycle threshold (Ct) values range from 17 to 37, targeting the high conservative region (ORF1ab/N gene) in SARS-CoV-2 genome. Metagenomic sequencing: The concentration of RNA samples was measurement by Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).<br/><br/>DNase was used to remove host DNA. The remaining RNA was used to construct the single-stranded circular DNA library with MGIEasy RNA Library preparation reagent set (MGI, Shenzhen, China).<br/><br/>Purified RNA was then fragmented. Using these short fragments as templates, random hexamers were used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA, followed by the second strand synthesis. Using the short double-strand DNA, a DNA library was constructed through end repair, adaptor ligation, and PCR amplification. PCR products were transformed into a single strand circular DNA library through DNA-denaturation and circularization. DNA nanoballs (DNBs) were generated with the single-stranded circular DNA library by rolling circle replication (RCR). The DNBs were loaded into the flow cell and pair-end 100bp sequencing on the DNBSEQ-T7 platform 8 (MGI, Shenzhen, China).<br/><br/>genomes were assembled with length from 26,840 to 29,882 nucleotides. The median age of patients was 36 (range:6-75). Two of twenty patients suffered severe or critical illness. Weifang sequences were combined with a diverse selection of sequences from China outside of Weifang and other countries provided by GISAIDElbe and Buckland-Merrett (2017). The new Weifang sequences are deposited in GISAID (XXXX-XXXX).<br/><br/>Mathematical model. The phylodynamic model is designed to account for nonlinear epidemic dynamics in Weifang, a realistic course of infection (incubation and infectious periods), migration of lineages in and out of Weifang, and variance in transmission rates which can influence epidemic size estimates. The model of epidemic dynamics within Weifang is based on a susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) model. We elaborate the model with with an additional compartment<br/><br/>J which has a higher transmission rate (\u03c4-fold higher) than the I compartment. Upon leaving the incubation period individuals progress to the J compartment with probability ph , or otherwise to I.<br/><br/>The model is implemented as a system of ordinary differential equations: S(t)<br/><br/>S(t) + I(t) + J (t) + R(t)    \u0307<br/><br/>E(t) = \u03b2 (\u03b2I(t) + \u03b2\u03c4J (t))    \u2212 \u03b30 E(t)<br/><br/>\u0307 = \u2212\u03b2 (\u03b2I(t) + \u03b2\u03c4J (t))    (1)    (2)<br/><br/>\u0307 = \u03b30 (1 \u2212 ph )E(t) \u2212 \u03b31 I(t)    I(t)    (3)<br/><br/>J (t) = \u03b30 ph E(t) \u2212 \u03b31 J (t)    (4)<br/><br/>\u0307 = \u03b31 (E(t) + J (t))    R(t)    (5)<br/><br/>We also model an exponentially growing reservoir Y (t) for imported lineages in to Weifang. The equation governing this population is<br/><br/>\u1e8e (t) = (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03bc)Y (t).    (6)<br/><br/>Migration is modeled as a bidirectional process which only depends on the size of variables in the Weifang compartment and thus migration does not influence epidemic dynamics; it will only influence the inferred probability that a lineage resides within Weifang. For a compartment X (E,I, or J), \u03b7 is the per lineage rate of migration out of Weifang and the total rate of migration in and out of Weifang is \u03b7X.<br/><br/>During phylodynamic model fitting \u03b2 and \u03c1 are estimated. Additionally, we estimate initial sizes of Y , E, and S. Other parameters are fixed based on prior information. We fix 1\u2215\u03b30 = 4.1days and<br/><br/>1\u2215\u03b31 = 3.8 days. We set ph = 0.20 and \u03c4 = 74 which yields a dispersion of the reproduction number that matches a negative binomial distribution with k = 0.22 if R0 = 2, similar to values estimated for the 2003 SARS epidemic (Lloyd-Smith et al, 2005).<br/><br/>Phylogenetic analysis.

        "Introduction": [
            "We report a genomic epidemiological analysis of one of the first geographically concentrated community transmission samples of SARS-CoV 2 genetic sequences collected outside of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China. These data comprise 20 whole genome sequences from confirmed",
            "COVID19 infections in Weifang, Shandong Province, People\u2019s Republic of China. The data were collected over the course of several weeks up to February 10, 2020 and overlap with a period of intensifying public health and social distancing measures. Phylodynamic analysis allows us to evaluate epidemiological trends after seeding events which took place in mid to late January, 2020.",
            "The objective of our analysis is to evaluate epidemiological trends based on national surveillance and response efforts by Weifang Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This analysis provides an estimate of the initial rate of spread and reproduction number in Weifang City. In contrast to the early spread of COVID19 in Hubei Province of China, most community transmissions within Weifang took place after public health interventions and social distancing measures were put in place. We therefore hypothesize that genetic data should reflect a lower growth rate and reproduction number than was observed in Wuhan. A secondary aim is to estimate the total numbers infected and to evaluate the possibility that there is a large unmeasured burden of infection due to imperfect case ascertainment and a large proportion of infections with mild or asymptomatic illness.",
            "To analyze the Weifang sequences, we have adapted model-based phylodynamic methods which were previously used to estimate growth rates and reproduction numbers using sequence data from Wuhan and exported international cases(Volz et al, 2020). This analysis has several constraints and requirements: Importation of lineages from Wuhan. The outbreak in Weifang was seeded by multiple lineages imported at various times from the rest of China. We use a phylodynamic model that accounts for location of sampling. Migration is modeled as a bi-directional process with rates proportional to epidemic size in Weifang. The larger international reservoir of COVID19 cases serves as a source of new infections and is assumed to be growing exponentially over this period of time.",
            "Nonlinear epidemiological dynamics in Weifang. The maximum number of daily confirmed COVID19 cases occurred on February 5, but it is unknown when the maximum prevalence of infection occurred. We use a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKeeling_2011_a\" href=\"#rKeeling_2011_a\">Keeling and Rohani, 2011</a>)",
            "for epidemic dynamics in Weifang. The model accounts for a realistic distribution of generation times and can potentially capture a nonlinear decrease in cases following epidemic peak.",
            "Variance in transmission rates(Lloyd-Smith et al, 2005).To estimate total numbers infected, the phylodynamic model must account for epidemiological variables which are known to significantly influence genetic diversity. Foremost among these is the variance in offspring distribution (number of transmissions per primary case). We draw on previous evidence based on the previous SARS epidemic which indicates that the offspring distribution is highly over-dispersed. High variance of transmission rates will reduce genetic diversity of a sample and failure to account for this factor will lead to highly biased estimates of epidemic size(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2017_a\">Li et al, 2017</a>). Recent analyses of sequence data drawn primarily from Wuhan has found that high over-dispersion was required for estimated cases to be consistent with the epidemiological record(Volz et al, 2020). Models assuming low variance in transmission rates between people would generate estimates of cases that are lower than the known number of confirmed cases. Separately, Grantz et al(Grantz et al, ????) have author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
            "found that high over-dispersion is required to reconcile estimated reproduction numbers with the observed frequency of international outbreaks. In this study, we elaborate the SEIR model to include a compartment(J ) with higher transmission rates. The variance of the implied offspring distribution is calibrated to give similar overdispersion from the SARS epidemic."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Despite an initial rapid increase in confirmed cases in Weifang in late January and early February, the number of confirmed cases by Weifang CDC show that outbreak peaked quite early and maximum number of cases ocurred on February 5. Phylodynamic analysis supports the interpretation that control efforts reduced epidemic growth rates and contributed to eventual control. Figure 1A shows the estimated time scaled phylogeny (maximum clade credibility) including 20 lineages sampled from distinct patients in Weifang and 33 genomes sampled from Wuhan and internationally.",
            "Figure 1B illustrates the phylodynamic model which was co-estimated with the phylogeny which provides estimates of epidemiological parameters summarized in Table 1.",
            "The estimated number of infections is shown Figure 1C. The time series of confirmed cases should lag the estimated number of infected because of delays from infection to appearance of symptoms and delays from symptoms to diagnosis. We also expect that an unknown proportion of infections will be missed by the surveillance system due very mild, subclinical, or asymptomatic infection. Our estimates do not support the hypothesis that there was a very large hidden burden of infection in Weifang over the period that the sequence data were sampled. Indeed, our central estimate for the number infected on 10th February is 53, which is only slightly in excess of the 44 cumulative confirmed cases at the end of February.",
            "Units: Migrations per lineage per year.",
            "Units: Substitutions per site per year.",
            "While we do not have sufficient data to detect a large decrease in epidemic growth rates as the epidemic progressed, we do find that the growth rates are somewhat lower than estimated in other settings and during the early epidemic in Wuhan. We estimate R0 = 1.99 (95% HPD:1.48-3.14) and the growth rate in cases was approximately 6% per day. The relatively low value of R0 corresponds to growth during a period when Weifang was implementing a variety of public health interventions",
            "and contact tracing to limit epidemic spread. These interventions included public health messaging, establishing phone hotlines, encouraging home isolation for recent vitors from Wuhan (January",
            "23-26), optimizing triage of suspected cases in hospitals (January 24), travel restrictions(January 26), extending school closures, and establishing \u2018fever clinics\u2019 for consulatation and diagnosis(January",
            "27)(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMao_2020_a\" href=\"#rMao_2020_a\">Mao, 2020</a>).",
            "As well as providing novel epidemiological estimates, our results point to the significance of realistic modeling for fidelity of phylogenetic inference. The use of a model-based structured coalescent prior had large influence over estimated molecular clock rates and inferred TMRCAs. Figure",
            "Supplement 1 shows that maximum likelihood inference of time-scaled phylogenies produces a distribution of TMRCAs which are substantially different than the Bayesian model-based analysis.",
            "Choice of population genetic prior will have a large influence on phylogenetic inference based on sparse or poorly informative genetic sequence data. Among the 20 Weifang sequences included in this analysis, there is mean pairwise difference of only three single nucleotide polymorphisms and only approximately twice as much diversity observed among the remainder of the sequences we studied. There is correspondingly low confidence in tree topology (Figure Supplement 2), and only three clades had greater than 50% posterior support including one clade which had a monophyletic compoisition of 13 Weifang lineages. The earliest Weifang sequence was sampled on January 25 from a patient who showed first symptoms on January 16. These dates cover a similar range as the posterior TMRCA of all Weifang sequences (Figure Supplement 3)."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "Our analysis of 20 SARS-CoV 2 genomes from Weifang, China has confirmed independent observations regarding the rate of spread and burden of infection in the city. Surveillance of COVID19 is rendered difficult by high proportions of illness with mild severity and an unknown proportion of asymptomatic infection(Guan et al, 2020). The extent of under-reporting and case ascertainment rates has been widely debated. Analysis of genetic sequence data provides an alternative source of information about epidemic size which can be more robust to imperfect case ascertainment. We do not find evidence for a large hidden burden of infection within Weifang. The relatively low estimate of R0 is consistent with a slower rate of spread outside of Wuhan and effective control strategies implemented in late January.",
            "While the value of pathogen genomic analyses is widely recognized for estimating dates of emergence(Verity Hill, 2020; Gire et al, 2014) and identifying animal reservoirs(Zhou et al, 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDudas_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rDudas_et+al_2018_a\">Dudas et al, 2018</a>), analysis of pathogen sequences also has potential to inform epidemic surveillance and intervention efforts.

        "To analyze the Weifang sequences, the authors have adapted model-based phylodynamic methods which were previously used to estimate growth rates and reproduction numbers using sequence data from Wuhan and exported international cases(Volz et al, 2020)",
        "This analysis has several constraints and requirements: Importation of lineages from Wuhan.",
        "Variance in transmission rates(Lloyd-Smith et al, 2005).To estimate total numbers infected, the phylodynamic model must account for epidemiological variables which are known to significantly influence genetic diversity",
