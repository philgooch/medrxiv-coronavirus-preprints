Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks in order to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and SARS.

            "Phylogenetic Analysis<br/><br/>We collected 53 full genomic 2019-nCoV sequences from the Gisaid database (Supplementary Table S1), plus the GenBank-deposited sequence from the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate WuhanHu-1 (NC_045512.2) and two partial sequences from Italian isolates (EPI_ISL_406959 and<br/><br/>EPI_ISL_406960). To compare 2019-nCoVs with closely related viral species, we obtained six sequences from distinct human SARS genomes from GenBank (the reference NC_004718.3, plus the genomes<br/><br/>AY274119.3, GU553363.1, DQ182595.1, AY297028.1 and AY515512.1). We also obtained six Bat coronavirus genomic sequences (DQ022305.2, DQ648857.1, JX993987.1, KJ473816.1, MG772934.1, EPI_ISL_402131). Finally, as more distantly related beta-CoVs we analyzed also MERS genomes from<br/><br/>GenBank entries JX869059.2 and KT368829.1.<br/><br/>We aligned all the 70 coronavirus sequences using MUSCLE [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] and inferred the evolutionary relationships between these sequences with a Tamura-Nei Maximum Likelihood estimation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] with 100 bootstraps for model robustness estimation.<br/><br/>The results are shown in Figure 1 as a phylogenetic tree representation. All the human 2019-nCoV appear very similar to each other, despite the different locations of sampling. Bat coronaviridae appear to be the closet homologs. Two specific specimens gathered in 2013 and 2015 in China from the bat species<br/><br/>Rhinolophus affinis and Rhinolophus sinicus appear to be located between the Bat coronavirus and the human 2019-nCoV groups, supporting the notion of a zoonotic transfer from bats to humans. Human SARS sequences group with Bat coronavirus sequences more distantly related to 2019-nCoV genomes. Finally, MERS genomes are the most genetically distinct amongst the other sequences.<br/><br/>A purely topological representation of a bootstrapped Maximum Likelihood tree (Supplementary Figure<br/><br/>S1) shows that 2019-nCoV sequences are highly similar to each other, with poor support to the existence of distinct subgroups.<br/><br/>The global Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is available as Supplementary File S1.<br/><br/>Global Genomic Variance<br/><br/>Our analysis shows similar results to phylogenetic tree representations. In Figure 2A, we show the catPCA of the first components for all analyzed genomes. The MERS/nonMERS grouping accounts for the largest variance, while SARS and SARS-like BCoVs cluster together). While 2019-nCoV constitute a tightly similar cluster, the two bat virus sequences MG772934.1 and EPI_ISL_402131 appear to be linking the human<br/><br/>2019-nCoV to the bat coronaviridae.<br/><br/>Given the high homogeneity between 2019-nCoV genomes, we developed a novel method to classify genomic sequences, based on categorical Principal Component Analysis (CATPCA, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]). Briefly, this analysis finds the eigenvectors describing the highest variance within a categorical dataset, like ours. Our dataset derived from the MUSCLE MSA of of 70 genomes and generated 32,206 positions: the categories in each coordinate could be A (Adenine), C (Cytosine), G (Guanine), (Thymine, although being a ssRNA virus, it would be more appropriate to use U - Uracil), N (Nucleotide, uncertain location: very rare in this dataset, and accounting for only 9 positions, or 0.0004% of all the data).<br/><br/>author/funder. It is made available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license.<br/><br/>A catPCA analysis on the sole 2019-nCoV sequences highlights some internal variability (Figure 2B), with two likely outliers identified in the genome EPI_ISL_406862 (collected in Germany) and EPI_ISL_406592<br/><br/>(collected in Shenzhen, China).<br/><br/>Although the variability within the 2019-nCoV genomes is very low, we set out to discover possible hot spots of hypervariability within the viral population. We analyzed the ~30,000nt of multiple genome alignments performed on the 54 full 2019-nCoV genomes. Our analysis shows that these viruses have largely the same genomic arrangement as the SARS species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. A large gene encoding for a polyprotein (ORF1ab) at the 5\u2019 end of the genome is followed by 4 major structural protein-coding genes: S = Spike protein, E = Envelope protein, M = Membrane protein and N = Nucleocapsid protein. There are also at least 6 other accessory ORFs (Open Reading Frames) (Figure 3A).<br/><br/>For each position of the multi-aligned 54 2019-nCoV, we calculated Shannon Entropy as a measure of the position variability [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Apart from the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends, likely non-protein coding and less homogeneous, we identified two hot spots of hyper variability at positions 8789 and 28151 (Figures 3B and C).<br/><br/>Position 8789 witnesses the presence of either T (U) or C, and it falls within the polyprotein gene. It causes a synonymous variation in the nucleotide triplet encoding for Serine 2839 (aminoacid coordinates based on the reference genome NC_045512.2), so it is likely not to introduce phenotypical differences between the different strains.<br/><br/>On the other hand, position 28151 falls within ORF8 and is characterized by the presence of either a C or a<br/><br/>U. This causes a Ser/Leu change in aminoacid 84, which can affect the conformation of the peptide, given that Serine is a polar aminoacid, and Leucine is nonpolar. The aminoacid appears to be non-conserved also across other coronaviridae (Figure 4, black arrow on ORF8 panel).<br/><br/>Entropy estimation within 2019-nCoV genomes<br/><br/>Protein Conservation within 2019-nCoV and between other beta-coronaviridae<br/><br/>We performed a cross-species analysis for all proteins encoded by the 2019-nCoV and its relatives.
