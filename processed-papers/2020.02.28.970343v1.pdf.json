        "abstract": "2 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory 3 coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Till date, 4 no vaccine or completely effective drug is available for the cure of COVID-19. Therefore, an 5 effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is needed to be design. This study was conducted to 6 design an effective multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven antigenic 7 proteins were taken as a target and epitopes (B cell, IFN- \u03b3 and T cell) were predicted. Highly 8 antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected T cell epitopes indicated significant 9 interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the world\u2019s population. 10 Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class I and twelve MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. Linkers and adjuvant were added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the vaccine. The allergenicity, physiochemical properties, antigenicity and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic and antigenic. Molecular docking demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and in silico cloning ensured increased expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 system. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed vaccine needs to be experimentally validated.",

            "Viruses are dangerous and can cause irreparable losses to human. The world hardly learns to deal with a virus when new emerges and threatens the future of humanity. A similar situation arose when a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans was reported last year 1.<br/><br/>Positive-sense RNA viruses called corona viruses belong to the Coronaviridae family that are distributed broadly among human and mammals. In the last two decades there have been more than 10,000 reported infections of two types of coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-COV) or Middle East Coronavirus (MERS-COV) 2. The type of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease and an ongoing epidemic has been declared by WHO as a global health emergency. COVID-19 pneumonia was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and subsequently occurred in Hubei province and other parts of the country through deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples, and later termed as<br/><br/>SARS-COV-2 6. SARS-COV-2 strain, according to World Health Organization, is almost 70%<br/><br/>like the SARS-COV strain, and 40% similar to the MERS-COV strain 7. Symptoms of SARS-<br/><br/>COV-2 may occur within 2 days or upto 14 days after exposure. Symptoms such as fever, diarrhea and respiratory disorder are present in infected people 4. According to the recent research SARS-CoV-2 has an identical genomic organization as of beta-coronaviruses, 5\u2019-<br/><br/>untranslated region (UTR) includes orf1ab (replicas complex), nsps (encoding non-structural proteins), S (spike protein) and 3\u2019-UTR includes E- protein (envelope protein), M-protein (membrane protein), Oraf6, orf7a, orf8, N-protein (nucleocapsid protein), orf10, and a lot of unknown non-structural open reading frames 3,8.<br/><br/>. A novel coronavirus was indicated root cause of COVID-19<br/><br/>There is currently no vaccine or approved treatment for humans, but the treatment options for<br/><br/>ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsules. Nonetheless, no clinical trials support the safety and efficacy of these medicinal products 9,10. Many other options could be used for the treatment of COVID-19 such as peptides, vaccines, small molecule drugs and monoclonaloligonucleotides based therapies but these preventive methods need month to years for development 11. There is no clinical trial-based vaccine present. To prevent viral diseases vaccine is the most effective method.

Antigenicity of these epitopes was checked. Finally, multiepitope vaccine (MEV) was designed using the most potent epitopes with suitable adjuvant and linkers. Online tools analyze the antigenicity, allergenicity, structural detail and physiochemical properties of the MEV. Molecular docking analyzed the binding interaction and stability of the vaccine-receptor complex. At the end, the vaccine codon was optimized for E. coli system and in silico cloning was performed (Figure 1)."

        "methods": [
            "2.1. Sequence retrieval<br/><br/>In the first step, the sequence of target proteins was retrieved from GENBANK 26. Then all the sequences were stored as FASTA format for further analysis.<br/><br/>2.2. Antigenicity and physiochemical properties evaluation<br/><br/>The Expassy Protparam tool was used to determine the physical and chemical properties of proteins<br/><br/>. To check protein antigenicity, the Vaxijen 2.0 software was also used<br/><br/>. The threshold value was held at 0.5, and the secondary structure of proteins was predicted by using<br/><br/>SOPMA (Alignment self-optimized prediction method) tool 29.<br/><br/>2.3. Tertiary structure prediction of target proteins<br/><br/>Different online tools such as Swiss model, Phyre 2, and Raptor X were used for the tertiary structure prediction of SARS-COV-2 proteins 30-32. Models retrieved were then refined by galaxy refine server and validated by Ramachandran plot analysis.<br/><br/>2.4. Epitope prediction<br/><br/>Inducing epitope (MHC I and II and IFN-\u03b3) is shown in the sequence of amino acids of all proteins.<br/><br/>2.4.1. B-cell epitope prediction<br/><br/>A surface receptor of B-cell recognizes B-cell epitopes, resulting the generation of antigenspecific immunoglobulins 33. In immune system the B-Cell epitope helps to detect viral infection and activities. An online database of ABCPred was used to predict 14-mer B-cell epitopes<br/><br/>Conformational epitopes were predicted by Ellipro server 36.<br/><br/>2.4.2. T-cell Epitope prediction<br/><br/>The most important step to develop an epitope-based vaccine is selection of T-cell epitopes with strong binding affinity to appropriate HLA molecules [4]. Current challenge in the immunological prediction of T-cell epitope sequences is the accurate prediction of interacting molecules. Most popular method considered, for epitope prediction is binding affinity prediction for a range of MHC molecules [5]. It is necessary for recognition by cytotoxic T-cells through molecular binding between antigenic peptides and MHC molecules. Therefore, it is crucial to identify MHC-binding peptides by any T-cell epitope prediction algorithm. For a functional T-<br/><br/>cell response, peptide binding to MHC and the interaction of this complex with a specific T-cell receptor are required [6]. The IEDB consensus method was used to predict 12 mer MHC classes<br/><br/>I and 15 mer MHC II epitopes. Due to a large number of HLA alleles used in this method, results are very important. Sequence was given in a FASTA format, selecting all alleles for prediction.<br/><br/>To be considered a good binder, epitopes with a consensus score of less than 2 was used, and selected for further research [7]<br/><br/>2.5. Immunogenicity prediction of peptides<br/><br/>To evaluate the antigenicity of T-cell and B cell epitope, Vaxijen v2.0 was used. 0.5 was used as default value. Non-antigenic epitopes were removed, and antigenic epitopes were selected.<br/><br/>2.6. Conservation of peptides analysis<br/><br/>Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) Conservancy Analysis tool was used, to monitor the degree of conservation in the protein sequence of B cell and T cell epitopes [8]. Epitopes showing 100 percent conservation were selected for further analysis.<br/><br/>2.7. Interferon-Y epitope prediction<br/><br/>IFN-\u03b3 is acknowledged to elicit intrinsic safe responses and can directly detain viral duplication.<br/><br/>Besides, they can validly actuate the versatile immune reaction by preparing cytotoxic T cells and T helper cells. IFN epitope server calculates IFN-\u03b3 epitopes of selected proteins of SARS-<br/><br/>CoV-2 using SVM hybrid algorithms along with Motif 37.<br/><br/>2.8. Population coverage analysis of selected epitopes<br/><br/>Predicting a T-cell epitope is not sufficient to become a good candidate for a vaccine.<br/><br/>predicted peptide(s) should effectively cover people in major areas. For population coverage, the separate epitopes of selected T-cells (class I and II) with the related HLA alleles were submitted to the IEDB population coverage analysis tool by maintaining the default analysis parameters 38.<br/><br/>The population coverage analysis tool forecast and calculates each epitope of various regions of the world based on the distribution of human alleles that bind to MHC.    The<br/><br/>2.9. Construction of multi epitope vaccine<br/><br/>To construct a vaccine sequence, a high scoring CTLs, high-affinity HTLs epitopes and simultaneously B cell epitope predicted by ABCPRED were selected. It was observed some sequence may act as both B and T cell epitope. The chosen epitopes should be preserved overlapping and immunogenic. The adjuvant and first CTL epitope were combined with the support of the EAAAK while different epitopes were connected using AAY and GPGPG linkers.<br/><br/>2.10. Structural analysis of vaccine construct<br/><br/>To determine the physiochemical properties of MEV the ProtParam tool was used. It analyzes various physical and chemical attributes that depended on the pK of amino acids involved. The theoretical pI, Grand Average Hydropathy, Stability Profiling, Instability Index, Half-Life, and<br/><br/>Aliphatic Index were checked. AllerTOP V2.0 server was used to evaluate the allergic and nonallergic nature of the vaccine server was used. This identification depends on various protein physicochemical characteristics and is alignment-free in VaxiJen. Secondary structure was predicted by GOR4 and PSIPRED<br/><br/>2.11. Tertiary structure and validation of MEV<br/><br/>The swiss model server was used to develop final MEV structure. The protein homology model was developed based on the quality of the QMEAN model. It gives results as QMean value and<br/><br/>GMQE value. GMQE (Global Model Quality Estimation) reflects the certainty of a model by taking into account the coverage, template, and arrangement of the target. It also offers a<br/><br/>. To check the antigenicity of vaccine construct the vaxijen2.0<br/><br/>calculation of quality by combining target-template alignment properties with the template search method. The higher the GMQE value, the better the model's quality. It is usually calculated in 0 and 1 range. Globally, QMean Z-score provides an intuitive level of basic highlights present in a model. If the score is around zero, the apprehension among the virtually identical size model structures and test structures ought to be remarkable. However, if this value is below or -4.0 the model is considered a low-quality model 32. The Galaxy Refine server has been used for strong and delicate methods for refining the structure. It produces several models with structure deviations from the given structure. Ramachandran plot was created to approve the tertiary structure of the vaccine developed by the online server RAMPAGE42. Consequently, ProSA-web has been used as a quality score for the whole structure of the modified vaccine protein 43. The quality score outside the usual range of native proteins indicates possible errors in the predicted protein structure. To evaluate the statistics of Non-bonded interactions ERRAT server was used 44.<br/><br/>2.12. Molecular docking of immune receptor<br/><br/>The interaction of vaccine molecule with the immune receptor was analyzed by the molecular docking. HDOCK carried out the molecular docking of the MEV with TLR3 and TLR8, to confirm the immune reaction. Protein-protein docking and protein-DNA/RNA docking was performed in HDOCK 45.<br/><br/>2.13. In silico cloning and codon optimization<br/><br/>Codon use differs from species to species in the organism and therefore unadapted codon can lea d to a lower host rate of expression. It should, therefore, be optimized to improve the gene expression by the host translation machinery. Codon optimization and reverse translation are examined by the tool of java codon adaptation to allow for proper vector translation expression and cloning efficiency. Escherichia coli (K12 strain) was identified as a host organism for the expression of MEV. Data were collected in graphical representations and the CAI values 46."

            "3.1. Pre-vaccine design analysis<br/><br/>The amino acid sequence of target protein (ORF1 [QHD43415.1], S [QHD43416.1], ORF3a [QHD43417.1], E [QHD43418.1], M [QHD43419.1], ORF6 [QHD43420.1], ORF7a [QHD443421.1], ORF8 [QHD43422.1], N [QHD43423.2] and ORF10 [QHI42199.1]) of SARS-<br/><br/>CoV-2 were retrieved from Genbank in FASTA format. Vaxijen was used to check the antigenicity of these target proteins. Total 7 highly antigenic proteins were detected. The most antigenic ORF10 protein has been found followed by the E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, and N having antigenic values of 0.7185, 0.6502, 0.6441, 0.6131, 0.6025, 0.5102 and 0.5059 respectively. ORF1, surface glycoprotein, and ORF3 proteins had antigenic values less than 0.5, so they were excluded. In addition, Blast p analysis was performed against Homo sapiens with predetermined parameters to identify non-homologous proteins. Proteins with less than 37%<br/><br/>identity were considered non-homologous proteins. None of the protein showed significant similarity with the human proteins.<br/><br/>Five non-structural proteins (M, N, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF10) and two structural proteins (E, ORF8) were selected as targets for further analysis. Other physicochemical characters like Theoretical pi, molecular weight, half-life, stability profile, aliphatic index, etc were predicted from protparam (Table 1) and secondary structure was predicted by SOPMA (Table 2).<br/><br/>3.2. Tertiary structure and validation<br/><br/>The 3D models obtained using Phyre 2, Raptor X and Swiss model homology approaches were evaluated through Ramachandran plot analysis. The model specifications and reliability were assessed using different homology modeling tools. The structures retrieved from Swiss model were of better quality than those from other homology modeling tools like the Raptor X and<br/><br/>Phyre-2. There was no suitable template found for ORF10 because of small number of residues so its structure was predicted by PEPFOLD<br/><br/>. The target protein pattern alignment was also observed with precise statistics. Besides, Galaxy refine server was used to optimize the models (Table 3).<br/><br/>3.3. Prediction of B-cell epitope<br/><br/>ABCpred was used to predict the target protein Linear B cell epitopes. Vaxijen was used to check the antigenicity. Screened out B cell epitope were 100% conserved in protein sequence and are antigenic. All the target proteins were predicted to have a total 55 linear epitopes (E-4, M-12, ORF6-1, ORF7a- 6, ORF8-9, N- 22, and ORF10-1) (Table 4). For determination of conformational epitopes, the Ellipro server was used. A total of 24 (E-4, M-2, ORF6-3, ORF7a-<br/><br/>4, ORF8-4, NC- 4, and ORF10-3) conformational epitopes were forecast of all proteins (Table    5).<br/><br/>3.4. T-cell prediction<br/><br/>T-cell epitopes of the target proteins were predicted by using the IEDB consensus method. 100%<br/><br/>conserved in protein sequence and antigenic epitopes were selected. Peptides that can bind to multiple alleles because of their strong defense capabilities are considered the most appropriate peptide. Total 31 MHC class I (E-9, M-4, ORF6-2, ORF7a-3, ORF8-7, N-4, ORF10-2) (Table 6)<br/><br/>and 40 MHC class II (E-4, M-5, ORF6-4, ORF7a-7, ORF8-12, N-4, ORF10-4) epitopes were chosen for further study (Table 7).<br/><br/>3.5. Population coverage<br/><br/>The distribution and expression of HLA alleles vary by ethnic groups and regions of the world.<br/><br/>Therefore, it affects the successful development of an epitope-based vaccine. The IEDB population tool was used to check the population coverage of the designed vaccine.<br/><br/>Selected epitopes showed the 99.29% world population coverage. The highest coverage of population found within a country Sweden 99.79% however, the least population coverage<br/><br/>5.72% was predicted in the United Arab Emirates. SARS-CoV-2 showed the population coverage of 84.51% in China where it was first identified (Figure 2).<br/><br/>3.6. MEV construction<br/><br/>A total 28 T cell epitopes were selected to form a vaccine construct.16 epitopes of MHCI (E-1, M-3,ORF6-1,ORF7a-3,ORF8-5,N-2,ORF10-1) and 12 epitopes of MHCII (E-1, M-13, ORF6-1, ORF7a-1, ORF8-2, N-3, ORF10-1) were merge with the AAY and GPGPG linkers respectively.<br/><br/>GPGPG prevents the generation of junctional epitopes, which is a major concern in the design of epitope vaccines; On the other hand, it facilitates the immunization and presentation of HTL epitopes 48,49. To join the CTL epitope, the AAY motif was used as a linker. The final length of the vaccine was 460 after long merging of adjuvant. Besides, the EAAAK connector was used as an adjuvant to the N-end of the vaccine to attach 45 amino acid long \u03b2-defensin. The vaccine's immunogenicity was increased with an adjuvant. An adjuvant and a CTL epitope were connected to the N-terminal of the structure of the vaccine by using the EAAAK linker to reduce interaction with other protein regions with efficient separation adjuvant final construct was 505 amino acid long (Figure 3).<br/><br/>3.7. Linear and conformational B epitopes and other physiochemical properties of MEV<br/><br/>ABCPred 2.0 and Ellipro servers have been used to predict linear/continuous and conformational/discontinuous B cell epitopes of the vaccine model without changing the prediction parameters. 92 continuous/ linear and 3 conformational/discontinuous B cell epitopes were predicted by servers (Table 8 & 9). The physiochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine construct computed via Protparam so it contains 505 amino acid with molecular weight 55426.35<br/><br/>KDa which reflects good antigenic nature. Theoretical isoelectric point (PI) of MEV was 9.12 which indicates negative in nature. The isoelectric point less than 7 showed negatively charged protein. Instability index computed by the protparam is 33.41, this categories protein as a stable.<br/><br/>Aliphatic index 82.75 which devotes a thought of proportional volume hold by aliphatic side chain and GRAVY value for protein sequence is 0.105 which indicates the hydrophobic nature of MEV. Half-life of protein depicted as the total time taken for its vanishing after it has been synthesized in cell, which was computed as 30 h for mammalian-reticulocytes, > 20 h for yeast,<br/><br/>> 10 h for Escherichia coli. Total number of Carbon (C), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H) and Sulfur (S) were entitled by formula C2549H3850N666O669S28.<br/><br/>3.8. Prediction of allergenicity and antigenicity<br/><br/>. After the addition of linkers and<br/><br/>AllerTOP was used to check the allergenicity of the vaccine construct which describe the nonallergenic behavior of vaccine. The vaccine antigenicity was 0.6741 at 0.5% threshold, indicating the antigenic nature of the vaccine, according to the VaxiJen.<br/><br/>3.9. Prediction of Secondary structure<br/><br/>Secondary structure of MEV was predicted by PSIPRED and GOR4. Among the 505 amino acids, the formation of \u03b1-helix is comprised of 113 amino acids representing 22.38%, 0 in \u03b2strands and 271 amino acids forms the coils which are 53.66% of the whole MEV construct.<br/><br/>3.10. Tertiary structure prediction and refinement<br/><br/>To determine the tertiary structure of vaccine Swiss model was used. GMQE was 0.04 and Q -<br/><br/>2.88, which indicates the high quality of the vaccine. Structure was improved by Galaxy refine.<br/><br/>After examining the modifications of 5 models, Model 2 was found to be the best model and was selected for further analysis (Figure 4). The improved model exhibits 95% favored region in<br/><br/>RAMPAGE and qRMSD as 0.428, poor rotamers as 0%, MolProbity as 1.889, clash score as<br/><br/>13.6 and RAMPAGE server analyzes and validates the tertiary structure by producing<br/><br/>Ramachandran plot. In the more favorite region, 96.3% of residues are generated, 3.7% of amino acids are resident in the permitted region, and 0.0% are present in outer regions according to the vaccine construct Ramachandran plot. ProSA-web also gives\u22122.25 Z, which is within an acceptable range of values. In addition, the refined model showed 0 errors with PROCHECK.<br/><br/>The refined model was 85.7143 in total quality (ERRAT score). These results show that the refined model is of good quality.<br/><br/>3.11. Molecular docking with TLR3 and TLR8<br/><br/>An appropriate association between immune receptor molecules and the antigen molecule is necessary to activate an immune responsiveness. HDOCK server has thus been used to perform the docking of the MEV with TLR3 and TLR8. The blue and red color shows the MEV in the docked complex, whereas TLR3 and TLR8 are depicted by a rainbow color respectively. The docking score and RMSD value of TLR3 and TLR8 with MEV were -244.88, -204.07 and 75.80, 80.46 respectively (Figure 5).<br/><br/>3.12. In silico cloning<br/><br/>The codon adaptation tool, an online server, was used for codon optimization analysis evaluating a cDNA sequence followed by a codon adaptation index (IAC) and GC data. The GC content of the structure is in the ideal range 55.51% (30-70%), and CAI 1.0 (0.8-1.0), indicating the effective expression of the protein reliability.",

            "Vaccination has many useful effects for improving people health in a low-cost manner and best aid to inhibit transmission of diseases around the world. Today researchers are searching methods for the development of subunit vaccines for complete genome. Vaccines are basically consisting of different immunogenic ingredients of disease (pathogens), comparatively the whole pathogenic agent advancement of the computational tools for designing a vaccine 53. In the field of bioinformatics<br/><br/>Immuno-informatics is a sub-branch that includes a lot of tools & databases. Immunological datasets prediction and in silico analysis are done with the help of those tools. With the advancement of tools and a variety of data availability like genomic, proteomic, and different<br/><br/>. Epitope prediction for antibodies becomes more significant with the algorithms made it more effective for scientists to predict epitopes that are much effective in the development of the sub-unit vaccines 12,13,54.<br/><br/>An outbreak of Wuhan SARS-COV-2 in late December 2019 resulted in hundreds of deaths in China 6. After the outbreak of Wuhan, remarkable progress has been made towards the identification, genome, and structure of virus and the development of effective drugs against<br/><br/>SARS-COV-2, yet its injection mechanism is still unclear. Till date, no vaccine or effective drug is available for the cure of COVID-19. Coronavirus vaccines need to be designed so that they can be eradicated form the globe entirely.<br/><br/>The recent study was conducted to design a multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against SARS-<br/><br/>COV-2 by using immunoinformatics approach. MEV is advantageous compared to monovalent vaccine because it can elicit cellular and humoral immunity<br/><br/>SARS-COV-2 was reported where they have used one and three proteins respectively for vaccine development, but this study included more number of proteins and epitopes vaccine subunit is therefore more effective and immunogenic against COVID-19. Amino acid sequences of ten proteins of SARS-COV-2 were taken from Genbank and their antigenicity was checked. Highly antigenic proteins were selected for further analysis. After the complete physiochemical analysis of antigenic proteins, B cell and T cell epitopes were predicted.<br/><br/>Predicting the B-cell and T-cell epitopes is an important step in vaccine development that\u2019s why both types of epitopes were predicted form protein sequences and their antigenicity was evaluated 56. After that antigenic T-cell epitopes were screened to overlap with B-cells and IFN-\u03b3 epitopes. Vaccine was designed with the help of linkers and adjuvant. An adjuvant was added to the N-end of the vaccine and epitopes were linked with the help of AAY and GPGPG linkers.<br/><br/>Adjuvant was added to increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Linkers were added to help<br/><br/>. Two subunit vaccines against<br/><br/>. The current maintain the function of each epitope so that after being imported into the human body they can function independently 31.<br/><br/>Finally, 505 amino acids long vaccine was designed including adjuvant. The vaccine protein was 55426.35 kDa in molecular weight. MEV was basic, according to the theoretical pI value, which can ensure stable physiological pH interaction. The calculated aliphatic index and instability index scores showed that the vaccine protein may be stable and thermostable. Positive score of grand average of hydropathy suggests its hydrophobic nature. MEV was found to be highly antigenic, immunogenic and non-allergenic indicating an epitope vaccine\u2019s potential to cause robust immune responses without any allergic reactions. The effectiveness of MEV depends on the population in which the vaccine is used. T cell epitopes included in the MEV showed 99.29% of the world\u2019s population, indicating that the vaccine developed would be effective for most of the world population. The strong binding affinity of the vaccine with immune receptor (TLR3 & TLR8) is necessary to effectively transport vaccine into the body. For this purpose, docking between the TLR3, TLR8 and MEV was performed. The translation efficiency of foreign genes within the host system differs due to the incompatibility of mRNA codons, which require codon optimization for higher expression 31. CAI value obtained was 1.0 and GC content 55.51% was also within the optimum limit indicating possible higher expression within E. coli K-12 system. Thus, MEV designed with caution using such a methodology could become an integral asset in the fight against tumors and viral contaminations. The results of recent study suggest that the vaccine being designed may undergo in vivo and in vitro experimental analysis to develop a potential vaccine against COVID-19."

        "conclusion": [
            "A serious global problem is morbidity and mortality, nowadays COVID-19 has, unfortunately, affected several precious lives in various regions of the world due to a lack of SARS-COV-2 vaccination. Several antiviral medicines have been tested but none have shown effective results against the infection. In this study, an attempt was made to design an MEV against SARS-COV-<br/><br/>that targets its antigenic proteins. Immunoinformatics and in silico approached were used to develop potential and safe MEV that can trigger three types of the immune responses: humoral, innate and cellular. However, current research is the result of an integrated vaccinomics approach. Therefore, experimental validation is necessary to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the designed vaccine."

Till date, no vaccine or completely effective drug is available for the cure of COVID-19. Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is needed to be design. This study was conducted to design an effective multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2.",
            "proteins were taken as a target and epitopes (B cell, IFN- \u03b3 and T cell) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected T cell epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the world\u2019s population.",
            "Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class I and twelve",

The allergenicity, physiochemical properties, antigenicity and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic and antigenic. Molecular docking demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and in silico cloning ensured increased expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 system. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed vaccine needs to be experimentally validated.",

MEV was found to be highly antigenic, immunogenic and non-allergenic indicating an epitope vaccine\u2019s potential to cause robust immune responses without any allergic reactions. The effectiveness of MEV depends on the population in which the vaccine is used. T cell epitopes included in the MEV showed 99.29% of the world\u2019s population, indicating that the vaccine developed would be effective for most of the world population. The strong binding affinity of the vaccine with immune receptor (TLR3 & TLR8) is necessary to effectively transport vaccine into the body. For this purpose, docking between the TLR3, TLR8 and MEV was performed. The translation efficiency of foreign genes within the host system differs due to the incompatibility of mRNA codons, which require codon optimization for higher expression 31. CAI value obtained was 1.0 and GC content 55.51% was also within the optimum limit indicating possible higher expression within E. coli K-12 system.

        "5. Conclusion": [
            "A serious global problem is morbidity and mortality, nowadays COVID-19 has, unfortunately, affected several precious lives in various regions of the world due to a lack of SARS-COV-2 vaccination. Several antiviral medicines have been tested but none have shown effective results against the infection. In this study, an attempt was made to design an MEV against SARS-COV-",
            "that targets its antigenic proteins. Immunoinformatics and in silico approached were used to develop potential and safe MEV that can trigger three types of the immune responses: humoral, innate and cellular. However, current research is the result of an integrated vaccinomics approach. Therefore, experimental validation is necessary to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the designed vaccine."
