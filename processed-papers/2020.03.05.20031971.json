        "abstract": "The recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) require fast, simple, and sensitive onsite nucleic acid diagnostics that can be developed rapidly to prevent the spread of diseases. We have developed a SENsitive Splint-based one-step isothermal RNA detection (SENSR) method for rapid and straightforward onsite detection of pathogen RNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. SENSR consists of two simple enzymatic reactions: a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that induces fluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that SENSR is an effective and highly sensitive method for the detection of the current epidemic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We also show that the platform can be extended to the detection of five other pathogens. Overall, SENSR is a molecular diagnostic method that can be developed rapidly for onsite uses requiring high sensitivity, specificity, and short assaying times.",

            "Increasing global trade and travel are considered the cause of frequent emergence and rapid dissemination of infectious diseases around the world. Some life-threatening infectious diseases often have signs and symptoms similar to cold or flu-like syndromes. Early diagnosis is therefore essential to identify the diseases and provide the correct treatment. Immediate and onsite diagnostic decisions also help to prevent the spread of epidemic and pandemic infectious diseases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. In order to rapidly diagnose infectious diseases, a nucleic acid-based diagnosis has emerged as an alternative to the conventional culture-based, or immunoassaybased, approaches due to their rapidity or specificity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].<br/><br/>To increase sensitivity, current nucleic acid detection methods generally involve a target amplification step prior to the detection step. The conventional amplification method is based on PCR, which requires a thermocycler for delicate temperature modulation. As an alternative to the thermal cycling-based amplification, isothermal amplification methods are available, which rely primarily on a strand-displacing polymerase or T7 RNA polymerase at a constant temperature[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. However, the complex composition of the isothermal amplification mixtures often renders these approaches incompatible with detection methods and whole diagnosis generally becomes a multi-step process[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. The diagnostic regimen with multi-step procedures requires additional time, instruments, and reagents, as well as skilled personnel to perform the diagnostic procedure.

Because the reaction components of the ligation-dependent methods are relatively simple, we hypothesized that the ligationdependent method could be exploited to establish a one-step RNA detection platform when combined with compatible amplification and signal generation methods in a single reaction mixture.",
            "In this study, we developed a one-step, ligation-dependent isothermal reaction cascade that enables rapid detection of RNAs with high sensitivity, termed SENsitive Splintbased one-step isothermal RNA detection (SENSR).

We further applied this platform to detect various pathogens, Vibrio vulnificus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Middle East Respiratory Syndromerelated Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Influenza A viruses, by merely redesigning the hybridization regions of the probes.

            "We designed a reaction cascade that allows the one-step diagnostic test, in which all reaction steps for nucleic acid detection occur simultaneously in a single tube (Fig. 1). The cascade consists of four core components, which includes only two enzymes: a set of oligonucleotide probes, SplintR ligase, T7 RNA polymerase, and a fluorogenic dye. The components were mixed in a buffer solution with ribonucleotides. Upon addition of the pathogen-derived RNA sample, the reaction steps of ligation, transcription, and dye-aptamer binding enabled detection, amplification, and signal production, respectively.",
            "Two single-stranded DNA probes were designed to include several functional parts involved in amplification, detection, and signal generation, thereby eliminating the need for human intervention during the entire diagnostic process (Fig. 1). First, the promoter probe consists of an upstream hybridization sequence (UHS) and a stem-loop T7 promoter. The",

            "The 5\u2032-end of the promoter probe was then phosphorylated for ligation. Next, a reporter probe consists of a downstream hybridization sequence (DHS) and a template sequence for a dyebinding RNA aptamer. The DHS contains the complementary sequence to the other half of the target RNA region. Similar to the UHS, the DHS was selected to have minimal predicted secondary structure (Supplementary Table 2).",
            "Once both UHS and DHS probes hybridize correctly to the target RNA, SplintR ligase can initiate the cascade by connecting the probes that have all features built for the onestep diagnostic test. Subsequently, T7 RNA polymerase can synthesize the RNA aptamer using the full-length, ligated probe as a DNA template, which can be bound with the fluorogenic dye to emit fluorescence as an output (Fig. 1). Notably, the reaction scheme of",
            "SENSR inherently supports two mechanisms that could amplify the signal: 1) multiple transcription events from the full-length, ligated probe by T7 RNA polymerase and 2) the presence of target RNA sequence on the full-length transcript which could be utilized as an additional splint for unligated probes in the reaction mixture. Accordingly, SENSR could enable sensitive RNA detection without any pre-amplification steps.",

Various isothermal amplification methods for RNA have been introduced to replace traditional methods[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], but they generally require numerous reaction components, often making them expensive and incompatible with the signal production step.",
            "In contrast, SENSR satisfies many desirable requirements for onsite diagnostic tests for pathogens, such as short turnaround time (30 min), low limit of detection (0.1 aM), inexpensive instrumentation and reagents, and a simple diagnostic procedure. SENSR integrates all component reaction steps using the specially designed probes that contain all required functional parts: promoter, hybridization sequence to target, and an aptamer template. Even with the multifaceted features of the SENSR probes, the design process is systematic and straightforward. Therefore, new SENSR assay can be promptly developed for emerging pathogens as exemplified by the successful design of SENSR assay for SARS-",

            "37\u00b0C.

The efficient hybridization between the probes and target RNA is one of the reasons for enabling high sensitivity during the isothermal reaction.",
            "RNA polymerase. Since the two strands of T7 promoter part are physically connected by the loop, the probability of formation of a functional double-stranded promoter is higher in the stem-loop structured design than when each strand of the promoter is not connected by the loop. Thus, the hairpin structured, self-assembling promoter sequence in the promoter probe can facilitate hybridization and subsequent transcription more efficiently.",
            "The initiated transcription elongates through the single-stranded DNA as a template to amplify target RNAs containing aptamer RNAs. The use of a fluorogenic RNA aptamer facilitated SENSR development by enabling fast and straightforward signal generation.",

            "The simple enzyme composition is another reason to enable one-step and one-pot detection. The fewer the enzymes, the easier it is to optimize in terms of temperature and buffer composition. In designing the detection scheme, we deliberately tried to reduce the number of enzymes, thus creating one of the simplest isothermal detection schemes based on two enzymes: SplintR ligase for target detection and T7 RNA polymerase for amplification.",

First, SENSR can be easily implemented in the initial screening of infectious diseases at places where a large number of people gather and transfer[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>].

In this work, we demonstrated the successful application of SENSR to six pathogens, using minimal redesign based on the highly modular structure of the probes. In theory, SENSR detection probes can be designed for any RNA as long as the target nucleic acid sequence is available.",
            "This feature provides SENSR a significant advantage over antibody-based diagnostics to rapidly respond to the outbreak of infectious disease. The nucleic acid probe synthesis is more scalable than animal antibody production. Therefore, SENSR is more suitable for rapid mass production of diagnostic kits than antibody-based diagnostics. Future efforts on automated probe design will be needed to accelerate the development of SENSR assays for newly emerging pathogens.",
            "In conclusion, SENSR is a powerful diagnostic platform for RNA detection, which offers a short turnaround time, high sensitivity and specificity, and a simple assay procedure, and eliminates the need for expensive instrumentations and diagnostic specialists. Given the simple probe design process, and its rapid development, SENSR will be a suitable diagnostic method for emerging infectious diseases."
