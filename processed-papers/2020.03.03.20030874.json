        "abstract": "Introduction Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 3000 (including clinical diagnosis) healthcare workers (HCWs) have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China. This study is aimed to investigate the risk perception and immediate psychological state of HCWs in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. \nMethods This study utilized a cross-sectional survey designed on a convenient sample of 4357 HCWs in China. Its data were collected using anonymous structured questionnaires distributed through social software. 6 questions were set to evaluate the participants' risk perception of COVID-19, and a General Health Questionnaire was used to identify the participants' immediate psychological status. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Risk perception and psychological status were compared by demographic characteristics and COVID-19 exposure experiences.\nResult A total of 4,600 questionnaires were distributed, and 4,357 qualified ones (94.7%) were collected. The main concerns of HCWs are: infection of colleagues (72.5%), infection of family members (63.9%), protective measures (52.3%) and medical violence (48.5%). And 39.1% of the HCWs had psychological distress, especially working in Wuhan, participating in frontline treatments, having been isolated and having family members or colleagues infected.\nConclusions The finding indicating that, faced with the COVID-19 epidemic, HCWs, especially in Wuhan, were worried about the risks of infection and protective measures, resulting in psychological distress, so further actions should be taken.",

        "conclusion": [
            "In the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic, HCWs, especially in Wuhan, were worried about the risk of infection and protective measures, causing 39.1% of them to have developed psychological distress. The prevention and control of epidemics should not rely on the sacrifice of a single group. In the subsequent fight against COVID-19 epidemic, adequate protective materials, enough rests, standard operations, protection training for non-infectious medical professionals and strengthening the family support for HCWs are urgent issues. Until this paper was submitted, the novel coronavirus has spread to 73 countries on all continents except Antarctic, European Union raised coronavirus risk level to high from moderate. HCWs in other countries may be confronted with similar difficulties as those in China, and we hoped that their demands and psychological state would be concerned early.<br/><br/>Contributors: Yuhong Dai is first author.

            "Through the analysis of the basic demography and COVID-19 exposure experience, the relevant factors affecting the mental health of the HCWs were confirmed. Through one-way ANOVA test, 8 demographic data (gender, age, location, occupation, work life, hospital level, marital status and fertility status) and 6 work exposure conditions (participating in the frontline treatment, having been isolated, getting infected, having family members infected, having colleagues infected, and volunteering for treatment) were all related to the psychological state. Through multiple factor regression analysis, it was found that women, working in Wuhan area and working in primary hospitals were poor prognostic factors. In terms of COVID-19 exposure history, poor prognostic factors include participating in frontline treatment, involuntarily participating in treatment work, having been isolated, and having family members or colleagues infected, while whether the respondents themselves have got infected or not was not an independent prognostic factor of psychological disorder. Risk factors for GHQ are depicted in Table 3."

Its impressing ability of spreading contagion exceeds SARS in 2003.12",
            "In the initial stage, this disease didn\u2019t arouse enough attention from administration departments, and the Chinese traditional Spring Festival accelerated the spread of epidemic across the whole nation, because the Spring Festival is the largest population migration annually. The arrival of the Spring Festival cut the medical protection industry\u2019s capacities, which further aggravated the phenomenon of insufficient protection. The rapidly uprising number of patients, and the public panics after it proved highly contagious, plus shortage of protective supplies and frequent occurrences of violent events in medical facilities 13, seemed to make medical burdens even heavier. 1,716 HCWs were infected and 6 staff died of this disease, according to the Chinese official announcement, which is thought to be incomplete statistics. We should pay more attention to HCWs' psychological tolerance, especially those fighting at the frontline of controlling the plaque. In this study, we used GHQ-12 to identify the mental health of HCWs. The criterion for determining suspected mental health problems is defined as a score of \u22653 points. The survey results of Chinese residents by using the GHQ-12 questionnaire showed that the positive rate of residents with a GHQ-12 score of \u22653 points is about 12.8%-21.18%.14 Many studies have used this scale to evaluate scores of HCWs in different countries, showing a positive rate of 25% -32%.14-16 A survey of frontline HCWs in Hong Kong during the period of SARS through GHQ-12 questionnaire showed 57% having experienced psychological distress.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] In this study, 39.1% of respondents were with GHQ-12 score \u22653, it is suggested that the incidence of psychological abnormality was significantly higher than that in normal times. A higher proportion of HCWs from Wuhan showed psychological abnormalities. As Wuhan is the epidemic focus of COVID-19, there are a huge number of patients, high rate of severe illness and high mortality. Due to the shortage of HCWs in Wuhan, they have to work with high workload for a long time. In addition, 10.2% of HCWs in Wuhan reported that their relatives were infected, while only 2.5% and 0.9% in other regions of Hubei and other provinces, respectively. And in Wuhan, the COVID-19 infecting rate among HCWs is much higher than other regions, reaching 20.2%. 58.3% respondents in Wuhan indicated their colleagues were infected, while only 18.4% and 3.7% in other regions of Hubei and other provinces, respectively. In Wuhan, 38.5% of the HCWs directly participated in the frontline treatment of the COVID-19 patients. And through multiple regression analysis, we found that psychological abnormality rate was much higher in the frontline HCWs. It is easy to understand that the frontline HCWs needed to contact COVID-19 patients directly and might be equipped with insufficient protective measures at any time, so they show more concerns for their own safety. Similarly, nurses had longer periods of contacts with patients; and in the infectious departments, because of no caregivers allowed in, nurses needed to take care of all the life of patients, thus more worried about getting infected. However, although the proportion of nurses with psychological disorder was higher than that of other professions, there was no significant difference. In primary hospitals, the lack of protective measures was more obvious, and primary HCWs lacked experience in treating critical illness, so there was a higher rate of psychological distress. Before and during the period of COVID-19 epidemic, incidents of violence against HCWs occurred in some parts of the country, including in Wuhan. In answering the questions on risk perception, 56.8% of the health workers said they were very worried about the medical violence, while 43.7% and 48.3% in other regions of Hubei and other provinces, respectively. How to prevent the medical violence and protect the",
            "HCWs in the upfront line of defense against COVID-19 is another critical problem for Chinese health administration. Our study showed that 10.1% of HCWs enrolled were not willing to participate in the COVID-19 treatment tasks, and the risk of abnormal mental state of these respondents was 2.3 times higher than that of voluntary ones. There was a higher risk of psychological abnormality among HCWs who had been or were being isolated or had family members or colleagues infected. Familial clusters of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were also observed in and out of Wuhan.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] More than half of the respondents expressed concerns about their family and colleagues in risk perception questionnaire. Impressively high contagion rates, long incubation periods and numerous asymptomatic virus carriers[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] may mainly contribute to the HCWs\u2019 concern over their family members, since doctors can\u2019t distinguish the COVID-19 infector in their common clinical work. Some communities even prohibited HCWs from entering the community after work, believing that they may be the potential source of infection, which further aggravated the remorse of HCWs and their concern for their families. As a result, most HCWs have to separate from their families, which further weakens the support from their families. Nevertheless, 89.9% of HCWs voluntarily participated in the frontline treatment of COVID-19. Only 34.7% of HCWs expressed in the risk perception questionnaire they were very worried about the risk of self-infection. Interestingly, it seems that there is no significant difference in psychological state between respondents with or without self-infection, which is quite unexpected for us. Previous studies of SARS have shown that supports from colleagues, clear instructions and strict precautions helped HCWs cope better with SARS and that they were less likely to develop psychological abnormalities.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] A number of studies have suggested that when medical workers are overburdened, their feeling too much responsibility for work, facing the uncertainty of work and ambiguity of role, short of training, and lack of support from superiors and colleagues, are all important exogenous factors causing occupational stresses on medical workers.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in a large number of patients in need of admission and treatment; other professional doctors were also engaged in infectious disease work; medical facilities were incomplete; materials were in short supply; management processes were out of order; and medical personnel were in great shortage due to colleagues\u2019 infection and quarantine-- all of these cases aggravated the occupational tension. However, in the context of epidemic disease such as SARS and COVID-19, HCWs fell into a state of unstainable work that they could not give up, resulting in the moral heroism and altruism of the medical group 22, as well as the extreme sacrifice of the group, which led to the decline of HCWs\u2019 attention to themselves. LIMITATIONS This study has several limitations. First, because of the disease outbreak, we were unable to conduct face-to-face interviews; second, the results are limited by the use of convenience sampling , which could not reflect the overall status of HCWs in China; and third, due to the time constraints, the scale we used is so simple that it can only provide a preliminary screening, further confirmation and intervention are needed."

        "CONCLUSION": [
            "In the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic, HCWs, especially in Wuhan, were worried about the risk of infection and protective measures, causing 39.1% of them to have developed psychological distress. The prevention and control of epidemics should not rely on the sacrifice of a single group. In the subsequent fight against COVID-19 epidemic, adequate protective materials, enough rests, standard operations, protection training for non-infectious medical professionals and strengthening the family support for HCWs are urgent issues. Until this paper was submitted, the novel coronavirus has spread to 73 countries on all continents except Antarctic, European Union raised coronavirus risk level to high from moderate. HCWs in other countries may be confronted with similar difficulties as those in China, and we hoped that their demands and psychological state would be concerned early.",
