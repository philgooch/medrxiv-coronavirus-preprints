        "abstract": "New coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 poses a big challenge for global public health in early 2020. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus rapidly spreads all over the world and takes thousands of lives in just two months. It is critical to refine the incidence and mortality risks of COVID-19 for the effective management of the general public and patients in the outbreak. In this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our result shows a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.",

            "COVID-19 patients and the public reference is presented in Table 1. Compared to the general public, the COVID-19 cases had higher average age, and there was a higher proportion of people aged 30 to 69 years.",
            "We collected detailed information of 76 mortality cases (45 cases from Hubei province and 31 cases from other parts of China) and plotted the age composition of the cases and the general public in Figure 1. It is evident that death occurs more frequently in older people but rare for patients under 40 years old. The mortality cases were from to 89 years old, with an average age of 71.47 and a standard deviation 12.49. Due to the limit sample size, conditional effect of gender on ages was not investigated for the mortality cases in the present study.",
            "Individuals were grouped and presented on x-axis. For the general public, proportion of each age group was shown on left-hand side; number of fatality cases in each group was present on right-hand side.",
            "Based on the age composition of COVID-19 cases and the general public, we assessed the relationship between the illness risk and age in a Bayesian approach. Given the age composition of the general public and illness risk of different age groups, age composition of infected individuals can be achieved in",
            "P(illness | Agei ) P ( Agei ) .",
            "Where P(illness | Agei ) is the illness risk of age group i; P ( Agei ) is the proportion of age group i in general public. We assumed that the illness risk for different age groups could be obtained by a function of age, for example, a logistic function in this study.",
            "Therefore, the risk can be estimated in a maximum likelihood approach when the age composition of both COVID-19 cases and the general public is known.",
            "Our result shows that the disease can happen in all age groups, and there lacks a significant difference between males and females (Figure 2). The illness risk is low for children and teenagers but rapidly increases for adults. For adults over 40-years old, the risk is higher than 0.9 when they have full exposure to the virus. The difference in illness risk for different gender is observed only for the groups between 15 and 50 years old. After the age of 15, males have slightly higher illness risk than women but the increase is ignorable for people over 50 years old. Our result does not support a previous report that COVID-19 generally affects more male than female in the epidemic[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "It should be mentioned that the illness risk in this study should be interpreted with the aforementioned Bayesian approach. Otherwise, it may mislead the understanding of our analysis. There is no evidence that any individual can be free from infection after full exposure to the virus. Infected young people may not become ill but asymptomatic during the course of infection.",
            "P( Death | Infection, Agei ) is the probability of death condition on an individual's age and infection state; P( Agei | Infection, Death) is age composition of fatality cases of COVID-19. In this study, we assumed that infection happens in all age groups for the general public. In other words, we have P( Agei | Infection) = P ( Agei ) .",
            "With the assumption fatality risk of COVID-19 for the general public is a logistic function of age of each individual, we applied the maximum likelihood approach to estimate the fatality risk of COVID-19 in the general public P( Death | Infection, Agei ) .",
            "Our result shows that there is a significantly higher fatality risk in older adults (Figure 3). The estimated fatal probability is less than 0.01 for individuals under 40 years old, but it is more than 0.51 for people older than 90 years. The estimated risk is much higher than the previous reports. To eliminate the concern that the high fatality risk of older people may inflate the mortality rate of infected population, we further imputed the mortality rate of infected people by summation of the proportion of death groups of different ages, i.e. P( Death | Infection) = \u2211 P ( Death, Agei | Infection) .Our i result is consistent with most of the previous studies, supporting the hypothesis that older age is associated with an increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Age has been reported as the independent predictor of adverse outcome in SARS and MERS.",
            "Comorbidities and low immune function of older people might be the major cause of higher mortality of coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Our analysis suggests a mortality rate of 2.38%",
            "for general infection. It agrees with previous reports for the raw mortality of COVID19 in China. However, we noticed that raw mortality of COVID-19 is significantly different between identified cases of Hubei province and that of other parts of China.",
            "To compare fatality risk between Hubei and other provinces of China, we divided mortality cases into two subsets, 45 cases from Hubei province and 31 cases from other parts of China. The aforementioned Bayesian analysis for fatality risk is applied to the two subsets with nine age groups each. We obtained standard deviation of estimations by applying the same method on 1000 simulated data sets that generated with initial estimation. Our result shows that fatality risk is no more than 0.13 \u00b1 0.10 for people over 80 years old outside Hubei province, but the risk is as high as 0.60\u00b10.15 for the corresponding age group in Hubei province. Fatality risk falls under 0.05 for people younger than 70 years in other parts of China, while only people under 50 years old have a risk under 0.05 in Hubei province. We also calculated the mortality rate for a general infection inside and outside Hubei province as 4.78% and 0.95%. On the one hand, this difference may be partially explained by insufficient medical resources due to such a large amount of patients in Wuhan city in the breakout. On the other hand, detailed information on the majority part of fatal cases (40 of 45 in total) from Hubei province was published before January 25th, 2019. The fatality rate of early reported cases may be overstated because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases, and the risk may be decreased with the improvement of medical service.",
            "Our analysis was based on the composition of the age of the different populations, and therefore it is less affected by the disease progression of patients, especially the increasing death of critically ill patients. As of February 23th 2020, there were still",
            "10,968 COVID-19 patients in severe condition in China. In contrast to a row mortality rate of 2.3% reported by a research group of Chinses CDC, our analysis on their age data of mortality cases suggests a higher mortality rate as 5.63% for COVID-19 patients.",
            "It is higher than the fatality risk of infection for the general public in both Hubei province and other parts of China. The difference may be explained by the existence of asymptomatic carriers in infection cases of the general public.",
            "In conclusion, we investigate the illness and fatality risk of the infection by analyzing the age composition of COVID-19 patients and the general public in China.",
            "Our data shows a relatively low illness risk for young people but a very high fatality risk for old adults. Therefore, it is prudent to strengthen the tertiary preventive and clinical care of old aged patients to reduce mortality. Furthermore, our results also support that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less. Our study could be of value to medical authorities to implement effective medical service. The lack of complete data for all COVID-19 cases potentially increases the occurrence of selection and measurement biases in this study. Therefore, further large-scale epidemiological studies are necessary to elucidate the risk factors of",
