        "abstract": "Objective The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposed a substantial health burden in mainland China and remains a global epidemic threat. Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group.\nMethod We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases. \nResults Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p&lt;0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients.\nConclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.",

            "Our study only addresses CFR among detected cases. The level of ascertainment of mild cases remains unclear. More estimates that include fatality risk among syndromic patients and asymptomatically infected individuals can only be available through enhanced routine surveillance, such as increased testing of patients with influenza-like-illnesses, and by analysis of future sero-epidemiological studies.",
            "Hubei province are higher than the crude CFRs reported by WHO and China CDC, which is 0.4-0.7%5,14. It is expected that the crude CFR obtained by dividing the cumulative number of reported deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases is an underestimate due to the inevitable delay between symptom onset and death. Our findings reveal that older individuals and male patients experience higher fatality risk, which is consistent with the WHO report 14.",
            "Additionally, WHO reported that patients with underlying conditions had much higher fatality rates[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Our study was unable to address the relative risk of fatal outcome among patients with underlying diseases compared to healthy people, because limited information on underlying conditions was available from publicly available data sources.",
            "A clinical study conducted in Wuhan showed that 4.3% of hospitalized patients died[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Another study relying on patients from 552 hospitals across 30 provinces, found that 1.4% of patients died 16, in which less study participants (28%) were from Wuhan. The estimates of these clinical studies would be the lower bounds for the CFR since separately 62% and 94% of patients were still in hospitals. The fatality risk from these clinical studies is higher than our CFR estimates, probably due to shortage of health services in Wuhan, e.g., advanced health care facilities for critically ill patients as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of other diseases caused by zoonotic coronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which had an estimated CFR of 34.4% globally[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with an estimated CFR of 10.9% across the world and 7% in mainland",
            "China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. In contrast, the CFR of SARS-CoV is in the same order of magnitude as that of pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus hospitalizations, which has an estimated CFR of 1.4% among hospitalized patients in Asia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. In the long run, depending on how much of the severity pyramid of SARS-CoV2 is captured in our data, the absolute severity of SARS-CoV2 may prove to be similar, to somewhat more severe, than the 2009 influenza pandemic, albeit with a different age profile.",
            "Comparison of clinical data from China and other countries will prove useful to settle this question.",
            "Outside Hubei province, close contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases were kept in quarantine for 14 days, and local hospitals tested patients with respiratory symptoms (e.g., fever and cough) and epidemiological links to Hubei province or other cases. This strategy would have enabled detection of many mild cases.",
            "However, a small number of mild cases were captured. In our aggregated dataset for Guangdong province for instance, only 8% of reported cases were mild, while the majority (83%) of reported cases had moderate disease severity with presence of pneumonia. And thus, our CFR estimates could approximately represent the fatality risk among laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with chest x-ray confirmed pneumonia. Even though clinical information for these patients was not available from publicly available sources, we believe that our",
            "CFR estimates could be viewed as the fatality risk among hospitalized COVID-19 cases. Chest x-ray confirmed pneumonia is a threshold for hospital admissions in in China. This may vary among countries due to different clinical practices and health service capacity.",
            "Clinical studies have reported a higher proportion of severe patients among older age group (29% vs. 14%)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. No specialized treatment for COVID-19 patients has been identified, and the mainstay clinical management has been supportive care.",
            "For non-critically ill patients, close follow-up is likely to be sufficient to manage the disease. But critically ill patients were more likely to develop ARDS and require ICU admission[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. That could explain our findings that severe patients had a higher fatality risk. The high observed CFRs of COVID-19 in older adults is consistent with the age profile of MERS, SARS, pandemic H1N1 2009, and seasonal influenza.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]",
            "Compared to the Eastern region, cases detected in the less developed Central region had a 2.45-fold higher risk of death, and those in West and Northeast region had a 2.93-fold higher risk. It is important to note that those variations in",

            "China shifted from a narrow clinical criteria based on three symptoms early in the outbreak (fever; radiographic findings of pneumonia; normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count at early onset of symptoms), to a broader criteria including any two of three symptoms by January 27. This would bias our sample towards more clinically severe cases before January 27. In addition to improvement in therapeutic capacity, the shift in surveillance definition could partially explain the declining trend of CFR from 8% to around 1%",
