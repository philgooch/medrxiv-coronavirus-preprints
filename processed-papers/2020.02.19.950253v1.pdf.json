Raw reads were first adaptor- and quality-trimmed using the Trimmomatic program (version 0.39)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. For removing host contamination, Bowtie2 (version 2.3.4.3) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]was used to map clean reads to the host reference genome of Manis javanica (NCBI Project ID: PRJNA256023). Only unmapped reads were mapped to 2019-nCoV reference genome (GenBank Accession<br/><br/>MN908947) for identifying virus reads.<br/><br/>Read Assembly and construction of consensus sequence<br/><br/>Virus-targeted reads were assembled de novo using MEGAHIT (v1.1.3)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Read remapping to assembled contigs was performed by using Bowtie2[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Mapping coverage and depth were produced using Samtools (version 1.9)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Contigs were taxonomically annotated using BLAST 2.9.0+ against 2845 Coronavirus reference genomes (Table S1).<br/><br/>Bat-Cov-RaTG13 genome was downloaded from NGDC database (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/)<br/><br/>(Accession no. GWHABKP00000000)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. 2019-nCoV reference genome was downloaded from NCBI (Accession no. MN908947)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Other coronavirus genomes were downloaded<br/><br/>ViPR database (https://www.viprbrc.org/brc/home.spg?decorator=corona) on 6 February<br/><br/>2020. We further used reference-guided strategy to construct draft genome based on those contigs taxonomically annotated to 2019-nCoVs, SARS-CoV, and Bat SARS-like CoV.<br/><br/>Each contig was aligned against 2019-nCoV reference genome with MUSCLE software (version 3.8.31)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Aligned contigs were merged into consensus scaffold with BioEdit version alignment-editor.html) following manually quality checking. Small fragments with less than length 25bp were discarded, if these fragments were not covered by any large fragments. The potential open reading frames (ORFs) of finally obtained draft genome were annotated by the alignment to 2019-nCoV reference genome (Accession no.    MN908947).<br/><br/>Phylogenetic relationship analysis (http://www.mybiosoftware.com/bioedit-7-0-9-biological-sequence-<br/><br/>Sequence alignment was carried out using MUSCLE software[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Alignment accuracy was checked manually base-by-base. Gblocks[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] was used to process the gap in aligned sequence. Using MegaX (version 10.1.7)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], we inferred all maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees under the best-fit DNA/anima acid substitute model with 1000 bootstrap replications. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the nucleotide sequences of various CoV gene data sets: the whole genome and ORF1a, ORF1b, Membrane (M) gene, spike (S) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. The best model of M is GTR+G and all others are GTR+G+I. Two additional protein-based trees were constructed under WAG+G (S1 subunit of S protein) and JTT+G (N-protein), respectively. Branches with values< 70% bootstrap were hidden in all phylogenetic trees."
