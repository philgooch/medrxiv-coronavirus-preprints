        "abstract": "Many detection methods have been used or reported for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of SARS-CoV2. Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive, claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, probably due to loss or degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrate its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produces clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allows for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific strain discrimination, which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a global health imperative. Finally, we also developed in parallel and tested a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method that is amenable to detect SARS-CoV-2, with the additional benefit of its potential for uncovering mutational diversity and novel pathogens at low sequencing depth.",

            "A severe epidemic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection, now just characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), started in December of 2019 in Wuhan China and quickly spread to many countries in the world[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. It has caused over 4000 deaths thus far and made daily impacts on various aspects of societal life around the globe[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA about 30kb in length. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is currently under careful investigation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and being extensively modeled according to the Chinese National Center for Biological information (2019 New Coronavirus Information Database, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). Of note, SARSCoV-2 exhibits over 99% sequence similarity among many sequenced isolates, and is also highly similar to other coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].<br/><br/>Present methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and discussed[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>], including RTPCR, serological testing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] and reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Currently, RT-PCR is considered the gold standard of diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 due to its ease of use and high sensitivity. RT-PCR has been reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], pharyngeal swab, blood, anal swab[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], urine, stool[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], and sputum specimens[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. In laboratory conditions, the RT-PCR methodology has been shown to detect 4-8 copies of virus, through amplification of targets in the Orf1ab, E and N viral genes, at 95% confidence intervals[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. However, only about 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, and 75% of RT-PCR negative results were actually found to be positive, with repeated tests required[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. In addition, there is evidence suggesting that heat inactivation of clinical samples causes loss of virus particles, thereby hindering the efficiency of downstream diagnostic evaluation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>].<br/><br/>Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to develop robust, sensitive, specific and highly quantitative methods for the delivery of reliable diagnostic assays[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. The urgency to develop an effective surveillance method that can be easily used in a variety of laboratory settings is underlined by the wide and rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-228-30. In addition, such method should also distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, SARS coronavirus, etc., as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. Furthermore, providing nucleotide sequence information through next generation sequencing (NGS) will prove to be essential for the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2\u2019s evolution[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic studies through genome sequence analysis have provided better understanding of the transmission origin, time and routes, which has guided policy-making and management procedures[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>].<br/><br/>For this type of technology, we reveal the development of a highly sensitive and robust detection assay incorporating the use of multiplex PCR technology to identify SARS-CoV-2. Theoretically, the multiplex PCR strategy, by amplifying hundreds of targets, has significantly higher sensitivity than RT-PCR and may even detect DNA molecules resulting from degraded virus genome fragments. Multiplex PCR has been shown to be an efficient and low-cost method to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections, with high coverage (median 99%), specificity (99.8%) and sensitivity. Moreover, this solution can be tailored to simultaneously address multiple questions of interest within various epidemiological settings[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. Similar to a recently described metagenomic approach for SARS-CoV-2 identification[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>], we also establish a user-friendly multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method that is not only able to detect SARS-CoV-2, but could also be applied for the identification of significant sequence mutations within known viruses and to uncover novel pathogens with a limited sequencing depth of approximately 1 million reads."

            "Mathematical model of RT-PCR<br/><br/>Several RT-PCR methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to date[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Among them, two groups reported the detection of 4-5 copies of the virus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. To investigate the opportunity for further improvement on the sensitivity of RT-PCR, we built a mathematical model to estimate the limit of detection (LOD) for SARS-CoV-2. The reported RT-PCR amplicon lengths are around 78-158bp, and the SARS-CoV-2 genome is 29903bp (NC_045512.2). Thus, in this mathematical modeling, we chose 100bp amplicon length and 30kb SARS-CoV-2 genome size for the estimation. With the assumption of 99% RTPCR efficiency[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], we found that RT-PCR assays could detect 4.8 copies of SARS-CoV-2 at 95% probability (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with the experimental results obtained in a previous report[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. In this model, the probability of RT-PCR assays to detect one copy of SARS-CoV-2 is only 26%. This finding may explain, at least in part, the low reported 47-56% detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in positive samples by RTPCR17,22. We further found that the LOD appears to be independent of the virus genome size. For genomes of 4 to 100kb, the detection limit remains 4.8 copies at 95% probability (Supplemental Fig. 1).<br/><br/>One way to elevate the sensitivity is to amplify multiple targets on the same virus genome in a multiplex PCR reaction, thereby increasing the frequency of occurrence in the mathematical model. Amplifying multiple targets has the advantage of potentially detecting fragments of degraded virus genome while withstanding sequencing variations, thus allowing for the detection of upcoming mutants. The amplification efficiency of multiplex PCR is critical for LOD. We estimated that the efficiency of our multiplex PCR technology is about 26% by using Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI)-labeled primers to count the amplified products after NGS sequencing (Supplemental Fig. 2). However, the amplification efficiency could be lower, and not all amplicons amplified successfully if the template used is one single strand of cDNA. Thus, more amplicons are potentially required for multiplex PCR to detect limited copies of viruses.<br/><br/>Mathematical model of multiplex-PCR-based detection method<br/><br/>We thus designed a panel of 172 pairs of multiplex PCR primers for the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV2 (Fig. 1B). The average amplicon length is 99bp. The amplicons run across the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome with a 76bp gap (76\u00b110bp) between each amplicon. Since the observed efficiency of multiplex PCR is about 26% in amplifying the four DNA strands of a pair of human chromosomes, we assumed an efficiency of 6% in amplifying a single-strand of cDNA. In addition, it has already been reported that 79% of variants are recovered when directly amplifying 600 amplicons from a single cell using our technology[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]. Therefore, we assume that 80% of amplicons would be amplified successfully. Using the same mathematical model described above, we estimated that our specific SARS-CoV-2-designed panel can detect 1.15 copies of the virus at 95% probability (Fig. 1C). Again, the LOD is independent of virus genome size.<br/><br/>We also designed a second pool of 171 multiplex PCR primers. These primers overlap with those in the previous 172-primer pool. Together, these two overlapping pools of primers deliver full coverage of the entire virus genome. If using both pools in detection, the calculated detection limit is 0.29 copies at 95% probability.<br/><br/>Detecting limited copies of SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>The workflow was designed so that the multiplex PCR products are further amplified in a secondary PCR, while sample indexes and NGS sequencing primers are added (Fig. 1D). The PCR products were first analyzed by electrophoresis for identifying potential positives. Since dozens of amplicons could be amplified from a single copy of SARS-CoV-2, an electrophoresis peak with defined peak size was expected. Multiplex PCR amplifies SARS-CoV-2, as well as other coronaviruses due to their high sequence similarities. In that context, electrophoresis analysis provides a fast and sensitive indication of infection from that family of viruses. In addition, the generated library allows for further investigation through NGS sequencing to provide definitive identification of the specific virus family member.<br/><br/>Two plasmids, containing the full sequence of S and N genes of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, were used to validate our multiplex PCR method. 28 amplicons are expected to be amplified within our 172amplicon panel. To simulate the use of real clinical samples, these two plasmids were spiked into the cDNA made from human total RNA. The copy number of each plasmid was determined by droplet-based digital PCR in QX200 from Bio-Rad\u00ae45. The two plasmids were diluted from approximately 9,000 copies to below one copy, and were amplified in multiplex PCR reactions. The library peaks of expected sizes were obtained from 9,000 to 2.8 copies of plasmids (Fig. 2A). Quantification of peaks demonstrated a wide dynamic range from 1 to about 1,000 copies of plasmids (Fig. 2B). The yield of the libraries started to saturate when the copy number was 1,700. It is possible that the saturation point could be even lower when all of the 172 amplicons are amplified from positive clinical samples, and the library peak could be observed with even fewer copies of virus. In contrast, the detected quantities of a single target on N gene by RT-PCR rapidly dropped when using 2.85 copies (Fig. 2B and Supplemental Fig. 3).<br/><br/>Estimated from the aforementioned mathematical model, 28 amplicons have a 16% chance to detect one single copy. To test this hypothesis, we amplified about one copy of plasmid in multiplex PCR reactions. Considering a multiplex PCR efficiency of 6%, the theoretical calculation gives a 66% probability to sample 1.1 copies, and a 12% chance to detect them. In reality, we experimentally observed a significantly higher 56% probability to detect 1.1 copies (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the efficiency of multiplex PCR is actually higher than the previously estimated 6% when single-stranded cDNA was amplified.<br/><br/>When the amplified products were sequenced, we found that the recovered reads were within a range of 20-fold relative depth with about 1.4 to 2.8 plasmids, and uniformly distributed across the GC range (Fig. 2D). When detecting down to 1.4 copies of plasmids, only the reads of one amplicon were about 100-fold lower than the average. Approximately 96% of the amplicons were recovered with 14 copies of plasmids, 77% with 2.8 copies, and 37% with 0.6 copies (Fig. 2E).<br/><br/>Metagenomic method design for novel pathogens<br/><br/>In order to discover highly mutated viruses and unknown pathogens, we subsequently developed a userfriendly multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method. In this method, random hexamer-adapters were used to amplify DNA or cDNA targets in a multiplex PCR reaction. The large amounts of non-specific amplification products were removed by using Paragon Genomics\u2019 proprietary background removing reagent, thus resolving a library suitable for sequencing. For RNA samples, our reverse transcription reagents were additionally used to convert RNA into cDNA, resulting in significantly reduced amount of human ribosomal RNA species.<br/><br/>We sequenced a library made with 4,500 copies of N and S gene-containing plasmids spiked into 10 ng of human gDNA, which roughly represents 3,300 haploid genomes. Even though the molar ratios of viral targets and human haploid genomes were comparable, N and S genes which encompass about 4kb of targets, were a negligible fraction of the 3 billion base pairs of a human genome. If every region of the human genome was amplified and sequenced at 0.6 million reads per sample, only one read of viral target would be recovered. Our results show that 16% of the recovered bases, or 13% of the recovered reads, were within the viral N and S genes (Fig. 3A and Supplemental Table 1). 80% and 78% of SARS-CoV-19 and mitochondrial targets were covered, respectively (Fig. 3B), and the base coverage was significantly higher than human targets (Fig. 3C). In contrast, only 0.08% of regions in human chromosomes were amplified. Furthermore, the human exonic regions were preferentially amplified (Fig. 3D). This suggested that the random hexamers deselected a large portion of the human genome, while favorably amplifying regions that were more \u201crandom\u201d in base composition. Indeed, long gaps and absence of coverage in very large repetitive regions were observed in human chromosomes (Fig. 3E). On the contrary, the gaps in SARS-CoV-19 and mitochondrial regions were significantly shorter (Fig. 3F), whereas the amplified targets overlapped and were longer than human targets (Fig. 3G).<br/><br/>The coverage was from 1000- to 10,000-fold for S and N genes, and 30- to 500-fold for the mitochondrial chromosome (Fig. 3F). The coverage is roughly within a 10-fold range, as is observed in human chromosomes (Fig. 3E). Therefore, increasing sequencing depth might not significantly improve the coverage. This 10-fold difference in coverage has been routinely observed with our multiplex PCR technology (Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Fig. 5). We were able to detect 80% of the regions from S and N genes in libraries generated using 4,500 copies of plasmids, with an average base coverage of 5,000 for a total sequencing depth of 0.6 million reads. A few targets of 150 to 200 bp in length from S and N genes were preferentially amplified. Even when copy number went down to a few copies (3-14), these targets were still detected (Fig.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]). They represented 14% and 11% of the target regions when 14 and 2.8 copies of plasmids were amplified, respectively."

            "Tremendous efforts have been made from around the world to provide a fast and reliable diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-19. RT-PCR is currently the preferential and most frequently used detection strategy. Yet, we found that the LOD for RT-PCR sits at around 5 copies with 95% confidence, independent of the size of the target genome. Consequently, to overcome the instability of RNA and the genomic sequence variability of virus genome due to evolution, more sensitive and robust methods are required.<br/><br/>Here, we report the development of a multiplex PCR assay for accurate identification of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. With 172 pairs of primers, this method enables the detection of low copy numbers, potentially degraded fragments of the viral genome, or even a mutated variant, with high confidence. The 172 pairs of primers cover about 56% of the genome of SARS-CoV-19. When detecting limited copies of virus, fewer targets are successfully amplified. In the case of one copy of virus, we estimate that 20% of the viral genome, or 6kb of sequences, can be amplified. These are sufficient to produce a conspicuous peak in electrophoresis for an initial indication of positives. The use of NGS sequencing can provide nucleic acid-level information to further confirm the identification, and provide additional evidence for phylogenetic analysis. In addition, our method is robust, accurate and easily performed from different levels of expertise in various laboratory settings.<br/><br/>Furthermore, we also propose a metagenomic method for the potential identification of unknown pathogens. Metagenomic technology usually requires about 20 to 100 million of sequencing reads in order to detect minuscule numbers of targets embedded in the massive amounts of human background. However, our method appears to selectively amplify target sequences. This bias permits the obtention of around 16% of target bases by sequencing at a depth of about 1 million total reads. It is thus especially suitable for the detection of novel pathogens and highly genetically unstable pathogens, such as influenza viruses. The exact mechanism of deselecting human sequences is currently under investigation. The random hexamer preference, chromosomal structure, sequence composition, target length, circularity, methylation status, telomeric and centromeric regions, as well as the edge effect, may influence such outcome. Ultimately, the observed preferential amplification towards more \u201crandom\u201d sequences could provide us with an advantageous edge for the continuous improvement of this method."

The plasmids containing either S or N gene of SARS-CoV-2 (pUC-S and pUC-N, respectively) were purchased from Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China. The PCR primers used in ddPCR and RT-PCR reactions for S gene are 5\u2019TGTACTTGGACAATCAAAAAGAGTTGAT and 5\u2019-AGGAGCAGTTGTGAAGTTCTTTTC; for N gene are 5\u2019GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT and 5\u2019-CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG, respectively. 343 pairs of multiplex PCR primers covering the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2 (the panel) were designed by Paragon Genomics, Inc. and separated into two pools. Pool 1, containing 172 pairs of primers, was used in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by multiplex PCR.<br/><br/>Reverse transcription 50ng of Universal Human Reference RNA was converted into cDNA using random primers and SuperScriptTM IV Reverse Transcriptase by following the supplier recommended method (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 18090050). After reverse transcription, cDNA was purified with 2.4X volume of magnetic beads, and washed twice with 70% ethanol. Finally, the purified cDNA was dissolved in 1X TE buffer and used per multiplex PCR reaction.<br/><br/>Multiplex PCR panel design Panel design is based on the SARS-CoV-2 sequence NC_045512.2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2/). In total, 343 primer pairs, distributed into two pools, were selected by a proprietary panel design pipeline to cover the whole genome except for 92 bases at its ends. Primers were optimized to preferentially amplify the SARS-CoV-2 cDNA versus background human cDNA or genomic DNA. They were also optimized to uniformly amplify the covered genome.<br/><br/>Multiplex PCR Plasmids pUC-S and pUC-N were combined with human cDNA and used in each multiplex PCR reaction. Paragon Genomics\u2019 CleanPlex\u00ae multiplex PCR reagents and protocol were used. Briefly, a 10\u03bcl multiplex PCR reaction was made by combining 5X mPCR mix, 10X Pool 1 of the panel, plasmid pUC-S, pUC-N and cDNA. The reaction was run in a thermal cycler (95\u00b0C for 10min, then 98\u00b0C for 15sec, 60\u00b0C for 5min for 10 cycles), then terminated by the addition of 2\u03bcl of stop buffer. The reaction was then purified by 29\u03bcl of magnetic beads, followed by a secondary PCR with a pair of primers for 25 cycles. The secondary PCR added sample indexes and sequencing adapters, allowing for sequencing of the resulting products by high throughput sequencing.

The PCR thermal cycling protocol used was 95\u00b0C for 10min, then 98\u00b0C for 15sec, 25\u00b0C for 2min, 60\u00b0C for 5min for 10 cycles. The reaction was then terminated by the addition of 2\u03bcl of stop buffer, and purified by 29\u03bcl of magnetic beads. The resulting solution was treated with 2\u03bcl of CleanPlex\u00ae reagent at 37\u00b0C for 10min to remove non-specific amplification products. After a magnetic bead purification, the product was further amplified in a secondary PCR with a pair of primers for 25 cycles to produce the metagenomic library. This metagenomic library was further purified by magnetic beads before sequencing.<br/><br/>ddPCR ddPCR was performed on QX200 from Bio-Rad\u00ae. Plasmids pUC-S and pUC-N at the estimated copy numbers 1 (6 repeats), 2 (3 repeats), and 100 (3 repeats) were tested.

            "Many detection methods have been used or reported for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of SARS-CoV2. Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive, claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, probably due to loss or degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrate its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produces clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allows for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific strain discrimination, which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a global health imperative. Finally, we also developed in parallel and tested a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method that is amenable to detect SARS-CoV-2, with the additional benefit of its potential for uncovering mutational diversity and novel pathogens at low sequencing depth."

        "Introduction": [
            "A severe epidemic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection, now just characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), started in December of 2019 in Wuhan China and quickly spread to many countries in the world[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. It has caused over 4000 deaths thus far and made daily impacts on various aspects of societal life around the globe[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA about 30kb in length. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is currently under careful investigation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and being extensively modeled according to the Chinese National Center for Biological information (2019 New Coronavirus Information Database, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). Of note, SARSCoV-2 exhibits over 99% sequence similarity among many sequenced isolates, and is also highly similar to other coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].",
            "Present methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and discussed[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>], including RTPCR, serological testing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] and reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Currently, RT-PCR is considered the gold standard of diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 due to its ease of use and high sensitivity. RT-PCR has been reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], pharyngeal swab, blood, anal swab[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], urine, stool[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], and sputum specimens[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. In laboratory conditions, the RT-PCR methodology has been shown to detect 4-8 copies of virus, through amplification of targets in the Orf1ab, E and N viral genes, at 95% confidence intervals[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. However, only about 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, and 75% of RT-PCR negative results were actually found to be positive, with repeated tests required[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. In addition, there is evidence suggesting that heat inactivation of clinical samples causes loss of virus particles, thereby hindering the efficiency of downstream diagnostic evaluation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>].",
            "Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to develop robust, sensitive, specific and highly quantitative methods for the delivery of reliable diagnostic assays[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. The urgency to develop an effective surveillance method that can be easily used in a variety of laboratory settings is underlined by the wide and rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-228-30. In addition, such method should also distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, SARS coronavirus, etc., as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. Furthermore, providing nucleotide sequence information through next generation sequencing (NGS) will prove to be essential for the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2\u2019s evolution[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic studies through genome sequence analysis have provided better understanding of the transmission origin, time and routes, which has guided policy-making and management procedures[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>].",
            "For this type of technology, we reveal the development of a highly sensitive and robust detection assay incorporating the use of multiplex PCR technology to identify SARS-CoV-2. Theoretically, the multiplex PCR strategy, by amplifying hundreds of targets, has significantly higher sensitivity than RT-PCR and may even detect DNA molecules resulting from degraded virus genome fragments. Multiplex PCR has been shown to be an efficient and low-cost method to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections, with high coverage (median 99%), specificity (99.8%) and sensitivity. Moreover, this solution can be tailored to simultaneously address multiple questions of interest within various epidemiological settings[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. Similar to a recently described metagenomic approach for SARS-CoV-2 identification[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>], we also establish a user-friendly multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method that is not only able to detect SARS-CoV-2, but could also be applied for the identification of significant sequence mutations within known viruses and to uncover novel pathogens with a limited sequencing depth of approximately 1 million reads."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Several RT-PCR methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to date[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Among them, two groups reported the detection of 4-5 copies of the virus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. To investigate the opportunity for further improvement on the sensitivity of RT-PCR, we built a mathematical model to estimate the limit of detection (LOD) for SARS-CoV-2. The reported RT-PCR amplicon lengths are around 78-158bp, and the SARS-CoV-2 genome is 29903bp (NC_045512.2). Thus, in this mathematical modeling, we chose 100bp amplicon length and 30kb SARS-CoV-2 genome size for the estimation. With the assumption of 99% RTPCR efficiency[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], we found that RT-PCR assays could detect 4.8 copies of SARS-CoV-2 at 95% probability (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with the experimental results obtained in a previous report[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. In this model, the probability of RT-PCR assays to detect one copy of SARS-CoV-2 is only 26%. This finding may explain, at least in part, the low reported 47-56% detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in positive samples by RTPCR17,22. We further found that the LOD appears to be independent of the virus genome size. For genomes of 4 to 100kb, the detection limit remains 4.8 copies at 95% probability (Supplemental Fig. 1).",
            "One way to elevate the sensitivity is to amplify multiple targets on the same virus genome in a multiplex PCR reaction, thereby increasing the frequency of occurrence in the mathematical model. Amplifying multiple targets has the advantage of potentially detecting fragments of degraded virus genome while withstanding sequencing variations, thus allowing for the detection of upcoming mutants. The amplification efficiency of multiplex PCR is critical for LOD. We estimated that the efficiency of our multiplex PCR technology is about 26% by using Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI)-labeled primers to count the amplified products after NGS sequencing (Supplemental Fig. 2). However, the amplification efficiency could be lower, and not all amplicons amplified successfully if the template used is one single strand of cDNA. Thus, more amplicons are potentially required for multiplex PCR to detect limited copies of viruses.",
            "We thus designed a panel of 172 pairs of multiplex PCR primers for the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV2 (Fig. 1B). The average amplicon length is 99bp. The amplicons run across the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome with a 76bp gap (76\u00b110bp) between each amplicon. Since the observed efficiency of multiplex PCR is about 26% in amplifying the four DNA strands of a pair of human chromosomes, we assumed an efficiency of 6% in amplifying a single-strand of cDNA. In addition, it has already been reported that 79% of variants are recovered when directly amplifying 600 amplicons from a single cell using our technology[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]. Therefore, we assume that 80% of amplicons would be amplified successfully. Using the same mathematical model described above, we estimated that our specific SARS-CoV-2-designed panel can detect 1.15 copies of the virus at 95% probability (Fig. 1C). Again, the LOD is independent of virus genome size.",
            "We also designed a second pool of 171 multiplex PCR primers. These primers overlap with those in the previous 172-primer pool. Together, these two overlapping pools of primers deliver full coverage of the entire virus genome. If using both pools in detection, the calculated detection limit is 0.29 copies at 95% probability.",
            "The workflow was designed so that the multiplex PCR products are further amplified in a secondary PCR, while sample indexes and NGS sequencing primers are added (Fig. 1D). The PCR products were first analyzed by electrophoresis for identifying potential positives. Since dozens of amplicons could be amplified from a single copy of SARS-CoV-2, an electrophoresis peak with defined peak size was expected. Multiplex PCR amplifies SARS-CoV-2, as well as other coronaviruses due to their high sequence similarities. In that context, electrophoresis analysis provides a fast and sensitive indication of infection from that family of viruses. In addition, the generated library allows for further investigation through NGS sequencing to provide definitive identification of the specific virus family member.",
            "Two plasmids, containing the full sequence of S and N genes of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, were used to validate our multiplex PCR method. 28 amplicons are expected to be amplified within our 172amplicon panel. To simulate the use of real clinical samples, these two plasmids were spiked into the cDNA made from human total RNA. The copy number of each plasmid was determined by droplet-based digital PCR in QX200 from Bio-Rad\u00ae45. The two plasmids were diluted from approximately 9,000 copies to below one copy, and were amplified in multiplex PCR reactions. The library peaks of expected sizes were obtained from 9,000 to 2.8 copies of plasmids (Fig. 2A). Quantification of peaks demonstrated a wide dynamic range from 1 to about 1,000 copies of plasmids (Fig. 2B). The yield of the libraries started to saturate when the copy number was 1,700. It is possible that the saturation point could be even lower when all of the 172 amplicons are amplified from positive clinical samples, and the library peak could be observed with even fewer copies of virus. In contrast, the detected quantities of a single target on N gene by RT-PCR rapidly dropped when using 2.85 copies (Fig. 2B and Supplemental Fig. 3).",
            "Estimated from the aforementioned mathematical model, 28 amplicons have a 16% chance to detect one single copy. To test this hypothesis, we amplified about one copy of plasmid in multiplex PCR reactions. Considering a multiplex PCR efficiency of 6%, the theoretical calculation gives a 66% probability to sample 1.1 copies, and a 12% chance to detect them. In reality, we experimentally observed a significantly higher 56% probability to detect 1.1 copies (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the efficiency of multiplex PCR is actually higher than the previously estimated 6% when single-stranded cDNA was amplified.",
            "When the amplified products were sequenced, we found that the recovered reads were within a range of 20-fold relative depth with about 1.4 to 2.8 plasmids, and uniformly distributed across the GC range (Fig. 2D). When detecting down to 1.4 copies of plasmids, only the reads of one amplicon were about 100-fold lower than the average. Approximately 96% of the amplicons were recovered with 14 copies of plasmids, 77% with 2.8 copies, and 37% with 0.6 copies (Fig. 2E).",
            "In order to discover highly mutated viruses and unknown pathogens, we subsequently developed a userfriendly multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method. In this method, random hexamer-adapters were used to amplify DNA or cDNA targets in a multiplex PCR reaction. The large amounts of non-specific amplification products were removed by using Paragon Genomics\u2019 proprietary background removing reagent, thus resolving a library suitable for sequencing. For RNA samples, our reverse transcription reagents were additionally used to convert RNA into cDNA, resulting in significantly reduced amount of human ribosomal RNA species.",
            "We sequenced a library made with 4,500 copies of N and S gene-containing plasmids spiked into 10 ng of human gDNA, which roughly represents 3,300 haploid genomes. Even though the molar ratios of viral targets and human haploid genomes were comparable, N and S genes which encompass about 4kb of targets, were a negligible fraction of the 3 billion base pairs of a human genome. If every region of the human genome was amplified and sequenced at 0.6 million reads per sample, only one read of viral target would be recovered. Our results show that 16% of the recovered bases, or 13% of the recovered reads, were within the viral N and S genes (Fig. 3A and Supplemental Table 1). 80% and 78% of SARS-CoV-19 and mitochondrial targets were covered, respectively (Fig. 3B), and the base coverage was significantly higher than human targets (Fig. 3C). In contrast, only 0.08% of regions in human chromosomes were amplified. Furthermore, the human exonic regions were preferentially amplified (Fig. 3D). This suggested that the random hexamers deselected a large portion of the human genome, while favorably amplifying regions that were more \u201crandom\u201d in base composition. Indeed, long gaps and absence of coverage in very large repetitive regions were observed in human chromosomes (Fig. 3E). On the contrary, the gaps in SARS-CoV-19 and mitochondrial regions were significantly shorter (Fig. 3F), whereas the amplified targets overlapped and were longer than human targets (Fig. 3G).",
            "The coverage was from 1000- to 10,000-fold for S and N genes, and 30- to 500-fold for the mitochondrial chromosome (Fig. 3F). The coverage is roughly within a 10-fold range, as is observed in human chromosomes (Fig. 3E). Therefore, increasing sequencing depth might not significantly improve the coverage. This 10-fold difference in coverage has been routinely observed with our multiplex PCR technology (Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Fig. 5). We were able to detect 80% of the regions from S and N genes in libraries generated using 4,500 copies of plasmids, with an average base coverage of 5,000 for a total sequencing depth of 0.6 million reads. A few targets of 150 to 200 bp in length from S and N genes were preferentially amplified. Even when copy number went down to a few copies (3-14), these targets were still detected (Fig.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]). They represented 14% and 11% of the target regions when 14 and 2.8 copies of plasmids were amplified, respectively."

        "Discussion": [
            "Tremendous efforts have been made from around the world to provide a fast and reliable diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-19. RT-PCR is currently the preferential and most frequently used detection strategy. Yet, we found that the LOD for RT-PCR sits at around 5 copies with 95% confidence, independent of the size of the target genome. Consequently, to overcome the instability of RNA and the genomic sequence variability of virus genome due to evolution, more sensitive and robust methods are required.",
            "Here, we report the development of a multiplex PCR assay for accurate identification of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. With 172 pairs of primers, this method enables the detection of low copy numbers, potentially degraded fragments of the viral genome, or even a mutated variant, with high confidence. The 172 pairs of primers cover about 56% of the genome of SARS-CoV-19. When detecting limited copies of virus, fewer targets are successfully amplified. In the case of one copy of virus, we estimate that 20% of the viral genome, or 6kb of sequences, can be amplified. These are sufficient to produce a conspicuous peak in electrophoresis for an initial indication of positives. The use of NGS sequencing can provide nucleic acid-level information to further confirm the identification, and provide additional evidence for phylogenetic analysis. In addition, our method is robust, accurate and easily performed from different levels of expertise in various laboratory settings.",
            "Furthermore, we also propose a metagenomic method for the potential identification of unknown pathogens. Metagenomic technology usually requires about 20 to 100 million of sequencing reads in order to detect minuscule numbers of targets embedded in the massive amounts of human background. However, our method appears to selectively amplify target sequences. This bias permits the obtention of around 16% of target bases by sequencing at a depth of about 1 million total reads. It is thus especially suitable for the detection of novel pathogens and highly genetically unstable pathogens, such as influenza viruses. The exact mechanism of deselecting human sequences is currently under investigation. The random hexamer preference, chromosomal structure, sequence composition, target length, circularity, methylation status, telomeric and centromeric regions, as well as the edge effect, may influence such outcome. Ultimately, the observed preferential amplification towards more \u201crandom\u201d sequences could provide us with an advantageous edge for the continuous improvement of this method."

        "SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic studies through genome sequence analysis have provided better understanding of the transmission origin, time and routes, which has guided policy-making and management procedures[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. For this type of technology, we reveal the development of a highly sensitive and robust detection assay incorporating the use of multiplex PCR technology to identify SARS-CoV-2",
        "The multiplex PCR strategy, by amplifying hundreds of targets, has significantly higher sensitivity than reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and may even detect DNA molecules resulting from degraded virus genome fragments",
        "With the assumption of 99% RTPCR efficiency[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], we found that reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays could detect 4.8 copies of SARS-CoV-2 at 95% probability (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with the experimental results obtained in a previous report[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]",
        "We further found that the limit of detection appears to be independent of the virus genome size",
        "Amplifying multiple targets has the advantage of potentially detecting fragments of degraded virus genome while withstanding sequencing variations, allowing for the detection of upcoming mutants",
        "The amplification efficiency of multiplex PCR is critical for limit of detection",
        "More amplicons are potentially required for multiplex PCR to detect limited copies of viruses",
        "Since the observed efficiency of multiplex PCR is about 26% in amplifying the four DNA strands of a pair of human chromosomes, we assumed an efficiency of 6% in amplifying a single-strand of cDNA",
        "The limit of detection is independent of virus genome size",
        "The workflow was designed so that the multiplex PCR products are further amplified in a secondary PCR, while sample indexes and next generation sequencing sequencing primers are added (Fig. 1D)",
        "Since dozens of amplicons could be amplified from a single copy of SARS-CoV-2, an electrophoresis peak with defined peak size was expected",
        "The generated library allows for further investigation through next generation sequencing sequencing to provide definitive identification of the specific virus family member",
        "It is possible that the saturation point could be even lower when all of the 172 amplicons are amplified from positive clinical samples, and the library peak could be observed with even fewer copies of virus",
        "When the amplified products were sequenced, we found that the recovered reads were within a range of 20-fold relative depth with about 1.4 to 2.8 plasmids, and uniformly distributed across the GC range (Fig. 2D)",
        "We sequenced a library made with 4,500 copies of N and S gene-containing plasmids spiked into 10 ng of human gDNA, which roughly represents 3,300 haploid genomes",
        "Our results show that 16% of the recovered bases, or 13% of the recovered reads, were within the viral N and S genes (Fig. 3A and Supplemental Table 1). 80% and 78% of SARS-CoV-19 and mitochondrial targets were covered, respectively (Fig. 3B), and the base coverage was significantly higher than human targets (Fig. 3C)",
        "The human exonic regions were preferentially amplified (Fig. 3D). This suggested that the random hexamers deselected a large portion of the human genome, while favorably amplifying regions that were more \u201crandom\u201d in base composition",
        "Long gaps and absence of coverage in very large repetitive regions were observed in human chromosomes (Fig. 3E)",
        "We found that the limit of detection for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction sits at around 5 copies with 95% confidence, independent of the size of the target genome",
        "With 172 pairs of primers, this method enables the detection of low copy numbers, potentially degraded fragments of the viral genome, or even a mutated variant, with high confidence",
        "In the case of one copy of virus, we estimate that 20% of the viral genome, or 6kb of sequences, can be amplified. These are sufficient to produce a conspicuous peak in electrophoresis for an initial indication of positives",
        "We propose a metagenomic method for the potential identification of unknown pathogens",
        "Metagenomic technology usually requires about 20 to 100 million of sequencing reads in order to detect minuscule numbers of targets embedded in the massive amounts of human background",
        "Our method appears to selectively amplify target sequences. This bias permits the obtention of around 16% of target bases by sequencing at a depth of about 1 million total reads",
        "The PCR primers used in ddPCR and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction reactions for S gene are 5\u2019TGTACTTGGACAATCAAAAAGAGTTGAT and 5\u2019-AGGAGCAGTTGTGAAGTTCTTTTC; for N gene are 5\u2019GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT and 5\u2019-CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG, respectively. 343 pairs of multiplex PCR primers covering the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2 were designed by Paragon Genomics, Inc. and separated into two pools"
