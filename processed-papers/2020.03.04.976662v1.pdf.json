            "As the largest non-segmented genomes among all the RNA viruses (about 30 kb in length), Coronaviruses (CoVs) own the plasticity due to the mutation and recombination, which increased the potential risks of spread across species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The<br/><br/>COVID-19 (original named 2019-nCOV) is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus (subgenus Sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. In early<br/><br/>December, 2019, an unexplained pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].<br/><br/>The emergence and rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 between infected and healthy people became so devastating as a large population within Wuhan was getting infected [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. There's evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bats, but there is no clear information about the intermediate host that transferred it to humans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across the six continents (source: World Health Organization report).<br/><br/>Despite the worldwide rapid spread, the genomic variation dynamics, evolutionary rate, and virus transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet well understood. In several recent studies, phylogenetic relationships, variations, evolutionary rates, and propagation dynamics were analyzed using limited genomic data from the SARS-CoV-2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. As the epidemic progresses, many research institutes around the world have obtained and submitted SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, increasing the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in the Data<br/><br/>Centers (i.e, GISAID). Given the extremely rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, an updated analysis with significantly larger sample sizes by incorporating cases throughout the world is urgently needed. This would allow for more accurate identification of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 variant dynamics, evolutionary rates, virus transmission dynamics, and epidemic history in order to effectively implement public health measures, promote drugs and vaccines development and to efficiently prevent similar epidemics in the future.<br/><br/>Recent research findings have suggested bat and other non-bat intermediate mammals (such as pangolin) as potential intermediate host for the SARS-CoV-2 that have so far been widely transmitted to humans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. According to the medical information of the first patients to be infected in Wuhan, 27 out of 41 patients were found to be traders of wild mammals in the Huanan seafood market, which directly suggests that the Huanan seafood market as the possible source of origin of the<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2, and later got transmitted it to other areas by the infected people [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].<br/><br/>However, due to some infected persons having no relation or access to the Huanan food market, some researchers are skeptical of the market as the only actual origin or the source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Therefore, up to date, in the absence of key potential intermediary host, the origin and transmission pattern of SARS-CoV-2 still need to be thoroughly probed for a more reliable and accurate information on the origin and transmission mechanisms of the virus.<br/><br/>In this study, 56 full genome sequences of outgroups and 136 genomes of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 from GISAID EpiFluTM database (access date 22 February 2020) were collected. Ten new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained by macrogenomic sequencing. The time origin, genetic diversity, transmission dynamics and evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed based on the genomic data to provide understanding on the origin, transmission pathway, and evolutionary characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak."

            "Patients and samples<br/><br/>In this study, ten patients with unexplained viral pneumonia from five hospitals in Hubei Province were included. Four samples were collected in December, four in<br/><br/>January as well as two samples in February. The December samples were examined by LightCycle 480II fluorescent PCR instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for investigating 26 respiratory pathogens and detection of the virus using SARS-Cov and<br/><br/>MERS-Cov primer probes. All the ten samples were detected by the SARS-CoV-2 primer probes. Two samples were used in the virus isolation. The 10 samples were also subjected to metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Specific sample information is presented in Table 1.    Virus isolation<br/><br/>Virus were isolated by HUH7 cells from one lavage fluid sample and one pharynx swab sample. The cells were monitored daily for cytopathic effects by light microscopy. HUH7 cells were harvested after 6 days of culturing at 37 supernatant was collected to extract the total RNA nucleic acid through EZ1 virus mini kit v2.0 (955134; Qiagen, Heiden, Germany), detection was performed by Light<br/><br/>Cycle 480II fluorescent PCR instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) followed by subsequent sequencing.    \u00b0C. The<br/><br/>Library preparation and sequencing<br/><br/>Total RNA extracted from 10 samples were subjected to metagenomic next generation sequencing testing by EZ1 virus mini kit v.2.0 (955134; Qiage, Heiden, Germany). TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to remove rRNA, reverse transcription and synthesize the double-stranded DNA. The fragmenting, modifying the ends, connecting the joints and enriching of DNA were done by NexteraXT library prepkit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), then the DNA library was obtained. IseqTM 100 i1 Cartridge, Miseq v2 reagent kit, and High output Reagent Cartridge (illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) were used for deep sequencing in Iseq100, Miseq, and Miniseq platforms (illumina, San<br/><br/>Diego, CA, USA), respectively. About 11.5 GB data were obtained for each sample.<br/><br/>Virus genome analysis<br/><br/>Using CLC Genomics Workbench 12 and Geneious 12.0.1 software (QIAGEN<br/><br/>Bioinformatics, Redwood City, CA, USA) and using reference sequence<br/><br/>BetaCoV/Wuhan-Hu-2019 (EPI_ISL_402125), the raw sequencing data of illumina were analyzed. The open reading frames of the verified genome sequences were predicted using Geneious and annotated using the Conserved Domain Database [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].<br/><br/>Phylogenetic reconstructions<br/><br/>In this study, for confirmation of the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>(Table S1), 136 complete genomes were retrieved from GISAID (Table S1, access on<br/><br/>February, 2020), and combined with our sequenced 10 genomes of this virus. In total, 56 outgroups were collected following the previous study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Mafft v.7.450 was used to align the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with reference sequences [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>].<br/><br/>Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome and major coding regions were done with RAxML v.8.2.9 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] in 1000 bootstrap replicates, employing the general time reversible nucleotide substitution model. The tree was visualized with FigTree v.1.4.3    [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>].<br/><br/>Population structure<br/><br/>On this analysis technique, to precisely decode the evolutionary history of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2, the genome EPI_ISL_402131 (bat-RaTG13-CoV) from GISAID was also included as the outgroup following the procedure outlined in the previous study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], because it is the closest sister betacoronavirus to SARS-CoV-2.3. The 136 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and an outgroup (bat-RaTG13-CoV)<br/><br/>were aligned using MAFFT then the alignment was manually checked using Geneious.<br/><br/>For probing the haplotypes relationships among localities, the Network v.4.6.1<br/><br/>(Fluxus Technology, Suffolk, UK) was used to construct the minimum-spanning network based on the full median-joining algorithm [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. During the alignment, 10 genomes containing ambiguous sites or \u201cN\u201d bases or more degenerated bases were excluded in this study (Table S1). In addition, 4 genome sequences (EPI_ISL_409067, EPI_ISL_412981, EPI_ISL_407071 and EPI_ISL_408489) with one degenerated bases were included, which were divided into two sequences without degenerated bases. For ensuring the accuracy of this analysis, the 5\u2019UTR and 3\u2019UTR contain missing and ambiguous sites of both regions were excluded in the following alignment analyses. DnaSP v.5.10 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] was used to convert the relevant format.<br/><br/>Population genetic indices in was estimated in DnaSP, including nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) and haplotype diversity (Hd). FST between haplotypes was calculated in Mega 6.0 based on haplotype frequency differences with 10,000 permutations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>].<br/><br/>Additionally, a sliding window of 500 bp and steps of 50 bp were used to estimate nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) for the entire alignment this data. Nucleotide diversity for the entire alignment was plotted against midpoint positions of each window. To indicate the relative position of the mutations in the genome, we selected the EPI_ISL_402124 sequence as the reference genome.<br/><br/>Population demography<br/><br/>The alignment was then imported into DnaSP for haplotype analyses. Population size changes were estimated based on a constant population size hypothesis using<br/><br/>DnaSP, in combination with neutrality tests (Tajima\u2019s D and Fu\u2019s Fs). The mismatch distribution was estimated based on the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in Arlequin to test the hypothesis of recent population growth. The Harpending's raggedness index (Rag) and the sum of squares deviation (SSD) were used to determine the smoothness of observed mismatch distribution and the degree of fit between observed and simulated data [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Because of the sensitivity to demographic changes of neutral tests, Tajima\u2019s<br/><br/>D [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] and Fu's Fs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>] were estimated using 10,000 coalescent simulations to assess the significance in Arlequin. In addition, the Extended bayesian skyline plot (EBSP)<br/><br/>analysis was conducted to examine past population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 based on 146 genomes by BEAST v.1.8 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. The divergence times were estimated in<br/><br/>BEAST using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with a strict clock. In this study, the substitution rate was set as 0.92\u00d710-3 (95% CI, 0.33\u00d710-3-1.46\u00d710-3) substitution/site/year based on the most recent estimation for<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. The other parameters were set as follows: extended Bayesian skyline process, 10 million MCMC generations, sampling every 1,000th iteration, the initial 25% burn-in. Tracer was used to check the convergence of the MCMC analyses (ESS values >200). Convergence of the two independent MCMC runs was assessed in<br/><br/>Tracer, as was convergence of model parameter values (effective sample size [ESS])<br/><br/>to ensure ESS values >200."

            "<strong>Results and discussion</strong><br/><br/>Genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>According to the database, the genome size of SARS-CoV-2 varied from 29,409 bp to 29,911 bp. In the network dataset, the aligned matrix was 29,130 bp in length including 183 variable sites, of which 27 were parsimony-informative and 156 were singletons, which were classified as 80 haplotypes (Table S2). Nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) was 0.16\u00d710-3 \u00b1 0.02\u00d710-3 (Standard Deviation, SD) and haplotype diversity (Hd) was<br/><br/>0.954 \u00b1 0.013 (SD) and variance of Hd was 0.16\u00d710-3 (Table S3). In this study, our new sequenced 10 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 represented 10 haplotypes (H3, H8, H10, H14, H16, H28, H29, H30, H76 and H78; Table S1). Among these 10 genomes, four samples were collected from those patients who had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Additionally, the HBCDC-HB-03/2019 belonged to the core H3 haplotype and most of them represented new haplotype. Sliding window analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed significant regional variation across the alignment (Fig. 1). The plot readily showed a relative high degree of nucleotide variation amongst the aligned SARS-CoV-2 genomes for any given window of 500 bp and steps of 50 bp, with the \u03c0 ranging from 0.00005 to 0.0014. Additionally, based on the curve, there were several relative high variation area, compared with other fragments (Fig. 1). The FST analyses among 80 haplotypes ranged from 0.00003 (e.g, H3 and H9; H14 and H15; H3 and H20) to 0.00134 (H19 and H80), which indicated genetic differentiation among these haplotypes (Fig. 2, Table S4). Overall, the H19 showed relatively large genetic distance with other haplotypes, while the H3 showed opposite pattern, and was also confirmed by the network figure (Fig. 2, Table S4). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 maintain the relatively rich mutations that has occurred across the world, which may be the main reason of the numerous subgenomic RNAs generated during the viral replication [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. This phenomenon also provides the possibility of widespread and adaptation for this virus. Fortunately, under the strict quarantine policy in China since 23 January 2020, the circulation and spreading of some haplotypes may have relatively reduced in circulation frequency relatively, compared with the early stage of COVID-19.<br/><br/>Phylogenetic relationship of SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>The virus's popularity and its intermediate host has been a topic of great concern.<br/><br/>Some researchers have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 originated from the bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].<br/><br/>However, some other researchers have proposed that the non-bat intermediate mammals (e.g. pangolins) may be the transmission path of this genus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. However, other studies have also failed to confirm the pangolins as the intermediate host to this viral genus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. In this study, based on the phylogenetic tree, bat-RaTG13-CoV was the sister group to the SARS-CoV-2 and the two pangolin samples collected from<br/><br/>Guangdong which showed a relatively large genetic distance from the SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>(Fig. 3 and S1). Based on this finding, , the study suggested that pangolin may not be the intermediate host, as had been reiterated by other previous study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. As the<br/><br/>Huanan seafood market was closed on 1 January 2020, this created many challenges in identifying the first intermediate hosts (whether people or animal) of SARS-CoV-2.<br/><br/>Therefore, more sampling and analysis of the sample from this area may suggest clearer results for more concrete conclusions in future studies.<br/><br/>Evolutionary relationships of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes<br/><br/>The evolutionary network of 80 haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2, with bat-RaTG13-CoV as the outgroup, is shown in Figure 4. The network analysis showed typical star network, with several core haplotype node (H3, H14, H15) and edge haplotype nodes.<br/><br/>In the network, fifty-five satellite haplotypes and H14 connected to the H3 haplotype; eighteen satellite haplotypes and H15+H3 connected to the H14 haplotype; and five satellite haplotypes and H14 connected to H15. Most of these haplogroups were separated by one to six mutations, except two haplotypes (H19 and H80, Fig. 4). The evolutionary network showed that bat-RaTG13-CoV to be connected through a hypothesized haplotype (mv6) to the H15 and H31 haplotypes by single mutations (Fig. 4). However, the mutations between mv6 and bat-RaTG13-CoV was more than<br/><br/>800, which indicated that SARS-CoV-2 still has a relative distant kinship with the outgroup (bat-RaTG13-CoV).<br/><br/>As the most abundant haplotype, H3 included 28 samples, while 55 satellite haplotypes are directly derived from the H3 haplotype (Fig. 4 and Table S1).<br/><br/>Moreover, many haplotypes from other countries should also be derived from the H3 haplotype. The current samplings showed that the H3 haplotype has been found to be in 28 samples, but 12 of 28 samples were collected from Wuhan in Hubei Province.<br/><br/>Fifteen of the 55 satellite haplotypes were also collected from Hubei Province (Fig. 4).<br/><br/>One possible explanation was that a common haplotype from the Huanan seafood market (Fig. 4) was rapidly circulated at an early stage of human-to-human transmissions. It is worth noting that in the H14, there are two samples (EPI_ISL_406801 and EPI_ISL_ 412979) from Wuhan. Although these two hosts didn\u2019t directly link with the Huanan market, one of the host (EPI_ISL_ 412979)<br/><br/>having lived in a residential area about 2 kilometers from the Huanan seafood market.<br/><br/>This also provides the possibility of them having indirect possible contact with the<br/><br/>Huanan seafood market.<br/><br/>Additionally, the networks of 24th December, 2019 - 30th December, 2019 and<br/><br/>24th December, 2019 - 6th January, 2020 also suggested that the most frequent haplotype (H3) occurred. All the haplotypes were collected from Wuhan, which indicated that Wuhan may have acted as the important origin center (Fig. 4). On the other hand, in this study, 16 sequences of Huanan seafood market (4 new sequenced and 12 GISAID data) were collected. Fifteen of out of the sixteen samples were collected before 1st Januray, 2020 and one samples was collected on 8th Januray, 2020.<br/><br/>These samples were represented ten haplotypes (H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H10, H11, H16), which indicated the high proportion of haplotype diversity in Huanan seafood market. Among those haplotypes, the H3 haplotype, the most abundant, was present in 6 samples from Huanan seafood market, while the other haplotypes were directly derived from the H3 haplotype. All the samples from the Huanan seafood market had the H3 haplotype and other 9 derived haplotypes (Fig. 4), indicating that there were circulated infections within the market in a short term. Noteworthy, in the network, a total of 65 virus samples from 15 other countries were assigned to 43 haplotypes. Among them, 27 haplotypes were satellite haplotypes of H3 haplotype, 11 haplotypes were satellite haplotypes of H14 haplotype, and 3 haplotypes were satellite haplotype of H15 haplotype. Indeed, most of haplotypes originated from the H3, which may hint the phenomenon was related to the input of virus carriers from    Wuhan.<br/><br/>Based on the outgroup (bat-RaTG13-CoV) having a possible direct connection with outgroup H15 and H31, it indicates that both the H15 and H31 were the suggested ancestral haplotypes (Fig. 4), as had also been suggested by other previous study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. The H15 was only recovered from five Shenzhen (Guangdong) samples, while H31 included 3 United States samples and 1 Fujian sample from China (Fig. 4).<br/><br/>Based on the epidemiological statistics, all the patients from the H15 were ever traveled to Wuhan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. As to the H31, three genomes from the same patient in Unite<br/><br/>State [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] and 1 genome from Fujian of China (Table S1) were included. For the patient in Unite State, He may have infected during the period of visiting his family in<br/><br/>China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. The travel history of Fujian sample was unclear, but we cannot deny that it has a history of unconscious Wuhan contacts. Based on the theory in the previous study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], this current study also supported two main evolutionary paths, that the available haplotypes could be from H15 through H14 to H3, or from H31 through<br/><br/>H14 to H3 (Fig. 4). Both these two path demonstrate that H14 was the key connection from an ancestral haplotype to H3. However, unlike the previous research, in H14, two individuals (EPI_ISL_406801 and EPI_ISL_ 412979) were collected from Wuhan.<br/><br/>Additionally, there was another new haplotype (H28, EPI_ISL_412980), which originated from the H14, and was also collected from Wuhan. Although the three hosts of these two haplotypes didn\u2019t directly link with the Huanan seafood market, one of the hosts (EPI_ISL_ 412979) lived in a residential area about 2 kilometers from the Huanan seafood market. This also provides the possibility for that host to have unconsciously indirect contact with the Huanan seafood market. Overall, it cannot further be proved the SARS-CoV-2 in the Huanan seafood market had been transmitted from other places or that Huanan seafood market did not host the original source of SARS-CoV-2. Due to the closing up of the Huanan seafood market on 1st of<br/><br/>January, 2020, it made it difficult to determine whether there were intermediate hosts in the market. To accurately determine whether this market was the central origin, further collection of early SARS-CoV-2 samples within/around the Huanan seafood market is needed to provide genomic information and epidemiological survey data needed in integration analysis. However, based on the facts provided in the current study undertaken in the early days of the outbreak of the pneumonia infection in<br/><br/>Wuhan, the Huanan seafood market promoted the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and since then, infected travelers have spread to throughout China and other countries.<br/><br/>Population size expansion of SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>As to population demography of SARS-CoV-2, the EBSP results revealed that it experienced an expansion of effective population size for the last 66 days prior to 11th of February, 2020 (Fig. 5). With the latest one being sampled on 11th February 2020, the first expansion date is estimated to had begun from 7th December 2019. The mismatch in the distribution of the total populations was also clearly shown through unimodal (Fig. 6) and the neutral tests (Tajima\u2019s D and Fu\u2019s Fs) revealed statistically significant population expansion of SARS-CoV-2 (Table S3), which also supported the EBSP results. In addition, with the change of time, multiple evidence (i.e.<br/><br/>haplotype number, Tajima's D, Fu's FS) indicated a relatively highest population growth at around 21st - 27th of January (Table S3). The demographic expansion of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 during this period was consistent with the patients first diagnosed on 8th<br/><br/>December, 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and the previously suggested most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) dates for SARS-CoV-2 at 6th December, 2019) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Additionally, considering that the virus has longest reported incubation period of up to 24 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], the virus may had first infected humans in mid to late November, which is basically consistent with the results of previous studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Therefore, in this study, EBSP revealed that SARS-CoV-2 experienced an effective population size expansion since<br/><br/>7th December 2019, which was also supported by a star-like network, EBSP, the neutral tests (Fu's and Tajima's D test) and mismatch analysis.

Additionally, based on the curve, there were several relative high variation area, compared with other fragments (Fig. 1). The FST analyses among 80 haplotypes ranged from 0.00003 (e.g, H3 and H9; H14 and H15; H3 and H20) to 0.00134 (H19 and H80), which indicated genetic differentiation among these haplotypes (Fig. 2, Table S4). Overall, the H19 showed relatively large genetic distance with other haplotypes, while the H3 showed opposite pattern, and was also confirmed by the network figure (Fig. 2, Table S4).
