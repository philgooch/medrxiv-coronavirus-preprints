        "abstract": "ABSTRACT \nOBJECTIVE\nTo study the clinical characteristics of non-surviving hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and tracked the causes of the death.  \nDESIGN\nRetrospective case series.\nSETTING\nTwo campus of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, and is responsible for the treatments for COVID-19 assigned by the government\nPARTICIPANTS\n101 non-surviving hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. Data were collected from 1 January 2020 to 15 February 2020. \nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nClinical data were collected using a standardized case report form. If information was not clear, the investigators in Wuhan contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patients or family members of non-survivors for clarification.  \nRESULTS\nOf 121 died patients with confirmed COVID-19, 101 cases with relatively complete medical records were included. The median age of the 101 non-survivors were 71 years (IQR, 59-80), 60 (59.41%) were men. 82 (81.19%) had fever, 82 (81.19%) had 1 or more comorbidities including hypertension (59 [58.42%]) and diabetes (22 [21.78%]) etc. The median course from hospitalization to death was 4d (IQR, 2-7d). Of 101 died patients, 100 (99.01%) suffered respiratory failure, 53 (52.48%) developed acute myocardial injury, acute kidney and liver injury occurred in 23 (22.77%) and 18 (17.82%) patients, respectively. Chest computed tomographic scans of non-survivors showed vast and fused ground-glass shadows. Compared to patients who survived 3 days, no statistical difference was noticed on lung severity score (11.91 vs 12.07) in patients who died within 3 days. Furthermore, significant elevated laboratory indicators including hypersensitive troponin (1.98 vs 0.2ng/ml), blood urea nitrogen (15.20 vs 10.08mmol/l), neutrophil count (11.23 vs 6.48 *109/L), procalcitonin (2.26 vs 0.58ng/ml) and lactic acid (3.80 vs 2.62 mmol/l) etc. were noted in patients who died with 3 days while PaO2 (54.75 vs 67.45mmHg), CD3% (51.57 vs 60.43%) and CD8% (16.42 vs 23.42%) were significantly depressed. \nCONCLUSION \nOlder patients (&gt;70 years) with comorbidities had a steeply increased risk of death when they suffered COVID-19. Besides respiratory failure, acute cardiac and kidney damage or failure, secondary to COVID-19, played a crucial role in causing death of patients.",

As of March 4, 2020, a total of 80420 COVID-19 cases in China have been confirmed and over 2900 lost their life.

            "Epidemiological, demographic and clinical characteristics By February 15, 2020, 121 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 had died in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (including Shouyi campus and Eastern campus), of whom 20 cases were excluded due to incomplete medical record. 101 cases were finally included in this study. 60 (59.41%) were males. The median age was 71 years (IQR, 59-80; range, 35-100 years). From the age distribution, the results showed that there were 56.44% cases (57/101) whose age over 70 years (31 cases in 70-79y; 20 cases in 80-89y; and 6 cases in more than 90y). The median duration from hospital admission to death was 4 days (IQR, 2-7d). The most common symptoms were fever (82 cases [81.19%]), dyspnea (59 cases [58.42%]), dry cough (56 cases [55.45%]), fatigue (36 cases [35.64%]), expectoration (21 cases [20.79%]) and diarrhea (10 cases [9.90%]). Other less common symptoms were anorexia, myalgia, abdominal pain and distension, headache, nausea and vomiting, pharyngalgia, haematemesis and melena, hemoptysis. (Table 1)",
            "Of the 101 patients, 82 (81.19%) had at least one comorbidity including hypertension (59 cases [58.42%]), cardiovascular disease (24 cases [23.76%]), diabetes (22 cases [21.78%]), chronic pulmonary disease (14 cases [13.86%]), cerebrovascular disease (13 cases [12.87%]), chronic kidney disease (11 cases [10.89%]) and malignancy (7 cases [6.93%]). (Table 2)",
            "Regarding to organ functions, 100 patients (99.01%) developed acute respiratory failure, 53 (52.48%) had acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury were developed in 23 cases (22.77%), acute liver dysfunction were found in 18 cases (17.82%) and 14 (13.86%) suffered coagulation disorders among which one patient was died of massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

            "Then we compared the demographic characteristics, presenting characteristics, and vital signs at presentation between patients died within 3 days of admission and after 3 days of admission. 48 cases (47.52%) died within 3 days of admission, median age was 72 years (IQR, 59-78; range, 30-94 years), 28 (58.33%) were males. 53 cases (52.48%) died after 3 days, median age was 71 years (IQR, 59-81; range, 31-100 years), 32 (60.38%) were males.",
            "Compared with patients who survived 3 days, patients who died within 3 days exhibited significantly higher respiration rate (25 vs 20) and heart rate (97 vs 84) at presentation. There were no significant differences of self-report symptoms between two groups including fever, dyspnea, cough, fatigue etc. (Table 1)",
            "Laboratory findings There were quite a lot differences of laboratory parameters between patients who died within 3 days of admission and those survived 3 days. Those died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (12.36 \u00d7109 vs 7.72\u00d7109/L), neutrophil count (11.23\u00d7109 vs 6.48\u00d7109/L) and lower eosinophils count (0.009 \u00d7109 vs 0.028\u00d7109/L).

For other biochemical indexes, procalcitonin (2.26 vs 0.58 ng/ml), hsTnI (1.98 vs 0.2 ng/ml), Creatine kinase-MB (6.14 vs 2.78 ng/ml), myoglobin (437.7 vs 216.8 ug/L) and blood urea nitrogen (15.2 vs 10.08 mmol/L) were over normal range and significantly higher in patients died within 3 days of admission.

            "Blood gas analyses showed patients died within 3 days presented with significantly lower oxygen saturation (80.58% vs 88.37%), higher lactate level (3.80 vs 2.62 mmol/L) and lower pH value (7.40 vs 7.42) compared with those survived 3 days. Although patients died within 3 days of admission had higher PaCO2 (38.97 vs 35.44 mmHg) and lower PaO2 (54.75 vs 67.45 mmHg), but there were no significant differences between two groups (Table 4). Cellular and humoral immunity analysis also revealed several differences between patients died within and over 3 days including percentage of CD3+ cells and CD8+ cells, concentrations of IgE antibody and C3 complement. Although only percentage of CD3+ cells in patients died within 3 days was below normal range, the percentage of CD3+ cells (51.57% vs 60.43%) and CD8+ cells (16.42% vs 23.42%) were significantly lower in patients died within 3",
            "days of admission compared with those survived 3 days. Patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher level of IgE antibody over normal range compared with those survived 3 days (157.3 vs 86.44 IU/ml). Level of C3 complement was within normal range in both groups with a significantly higher titration in patients died within 3 days compared with those survived 3 days (1.03 vs 0.89g/L). Other immune parameters did not show significant differences between patients died within 3 days of admission and over 3 days. (Table 5)",
            "Radiographic changes Chest CT scans were used to evaluate the features of lung injury. Only 38 cases had chest CT image in our medical system (11 cases in within 3 days subgroup and 27 cases in over 3 days subgroup). Patients suffered severe lung damage and their lung imaging features presented the vast or merged glass shadow, but quantitation of lung lobe injury and injury score revealed no significant difference between the two subgroups.

            "COVID-19 were included in this study. We aim to present the clinical features, organ dysfunction, laboratory indicators of the 101 non-survivors, and analyze possible causes accounted for the rapid progress of disease and death. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical features and treatment measures of COVID-19 posed huge challenge for our clinical practice. Although previous study reported the mortality of patients with COVID-19 is 1.4% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], some special population including the aged and individuals with underlying comorbidities may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our cohort, the median age of non-survivor was 71 years, 81.19% of them combined with one or more underlying medical conditions including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and malignancy. This study suggested that patients aged over 70 years with chronic medical conditions were more likely to suffer a severe attack and death.",
            "Common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 were fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue etc. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In our cohort, we observed that, besides fever and cough, dyspnea (58.42%) presented early in most non-survivors with confirmed COVID-19, similar finding has also been observed in critically ill patients reported by Yang etc. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. In these non-survivors, featured complications during hospitalization including ARDS and respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury (ACI), AKI, acute liver injury (ALI) and abnormal coagulation. In terms of SARS, severe respiratory failure was the leading cause of mortality, with little other organ failure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. It is surprised that we observed 52.48% and 22.77% non-survivors suffered heart failure and AKI, respectively. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial SARS-CoV-2 receptor, distributed widely in heart, kidney and intestine etc. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Whether SARS-CoV-2 attack heart and kidney or other vital organs directly need to be confirmed further.",
            "The most common laboratory abnormalities observed in this study were elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, high sensitivity troponin, blood urea nitrogen and decreased lymphocytes percentage etc. (Table 3, 5).",
            "Compared with those died after 3 days of admission, non-survivors died within 3 days had numerous different findings including depressed percentages of lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD8+ cells, and elevated white blood cell count, high sensitivity troponin and urea nitrogen etc. These evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with cellular immune deficiency, acute myocardial injury and kidney injury etc. These results also support the described organ failure above. In addition, the characteristic chest CT imaging of these non-survivors were evaluated by previous described method [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. The CT features demonstrated extensive infection and severe damage, regarded as \u201cwhite lung\u201d, in five lobes, but no significant difference was found between the two groups. These characteristics combined with above repented organ failure, laboratory abnormalities suggested that early organ dysfunction or failure were responsible for rapid progression of disease and death of the patients.",
            "Up to now, no antiviral treatment has been recommended for coronavirus treatment except supportive care and organ support [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. In current clinical practice, arbidol was used as an antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, but the curative effect remains unclear. Other antiviral medications including remdesivir and lopinavir etc. are still being verified in clinical trials. Furthermore, use of intravenous immunoglobulin is recommended to enhance the ability of anti-infection for severely ill patients and steroids are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short duration of treatment as possible [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. In this study, 96.04% patients received antiviral therapy, 98.02% received antibacterial therapy. Use of glucocorticoid mainly depended on the severity of inflammatory response. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, all the non-survivors received oxygen inhalation therapy including high flow oxygen inhalation (77.23%), but quite a low proportion of patients received machine ventilation partly due to limited medical resources against the steeply increasing number of patients.",
            "Limitations of this study Several limitations existed in this study. Firstly, nearly two thirds of these non-survivors had no chest CT data in our medical system (because most of these patients were transferred from other hospitals without electronic version of imaging data) and evaluation of these imaging features partly depended on the experience of clinicians and radiologists. Secondly, incomplete medical information of some non-survivors may lead to the occurrence of bias. Thirdly, patients died within a short time after admission is unfavorable to track risk factors for this poor outcome. Finally, in the early outbreak of COVID-19, relatively inadequate medical resources may affect the observation of the natural course of disease."

            "Previous studies concentrated to show the epidemiological findings, clinical characteristics, and clinical outcome of patient with COVID-19 involved in mild and severe cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]",
            "Those infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are vulnerable to suffer severe attack or death, the causes that lead to the occurrence of rapid death are necessary to be addressed further"
        ],
        "Methods": [
            "Study Design and Participants All died patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, China, were enrolled.",
            "Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals and is responsible for the treatments for COVID-19 assigned by the government.",
            "All patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
            "To analyze the reasons accounted for patients died in a short time after admission, the authors compared demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics between patients died within 3 days of admission with those who survived 3 days"
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Of 121 died patients with confirmed COVID-19, 101 cases with relatively complete medical records were included.",
            "The median age of the 101 non-survivors were 71 years (IQR, 59-80), 60 (59.41%) were men.",
            "Epidemiological, demographic and clinical characteristics By February 15, 2020, 121 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 had died in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, of whom 20 cases were excluded due to incomplete medical record.",
            "The median duration from hospital admission to death was 4 days (IQR, 2-7d).",
            "Other less common symptoms were anorexia, myalgia, abdominal pain and distension, headache, nausea and vomiting, pharyngalgia, haematemesis and melena, hemoptysis. (Table 1)"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Older patients (>70 years) with comorbidities had a steeply increased risk of death when they suffered COVID-19.",
            "Acute cardiac and kidney damage or failure, secondary to COVID-19, played a crucial role in causing death of patients.",
            "The findings of the study suggested that older patients (>70 years) with comorbidities are at higher risks for poor outcomes.",
            "Acute heart injury and kidney injury, secondary to COVID-19, played a crucial role in causing death of patients",
            "All authors reviewed and approved the final version of the manuscript"
