            "Ethics statement. This study was undertaken as part of the national disease outbreak and the response and the protocols were approved by the ethics committee of the National Healthcare<br/><br/>Group. Patient samples were collected under PROTECT (2012/00917), a multi-centred<br/><br/>Prospective Study to Detect Novel Pathogens and Characterize Emerging Infections. Work undertaken at the Duke-NUS Medical School ABSL3 laboratory was approved by the Duke-<br/><br/>NUS ABSL3 Biosafety Committee, National University of Singapore and Ministry of Health    Singapore.<br/><br/>Virus culture, RNA extraction and sequencing. Clinical samples from infected patients were collected from public hospitals in Singapore from January\u2013February 2020. Material from clinical samples was used to inoculate Vero-E6 cells (ATCC\u00aeCRL-1586TM). Total RNA was extracted using E.Z.N.A. Total RNA Kit I (Omega Bio-tek) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and samples analysed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-<br/><br/>qPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 as previously described [18]. Whole genome sequencing was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) methodology. The cDNA libraries were constructed using TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq System. Raw NGS reads were trimmed by Trimmomatic v0.39 [19] to remove adaptors and low-quality bases.<br/><br/>Genome sequences were assembled and consensus sequences obtained using the BWA algorithm in UGENE v.33. To verify the presence of the deletion in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we designed two specific PCR primers (F primer: 5\u2019-<br/><br/>TGTTAGAGGTACAACAGTACTTT-3\u2019 and R primer: 5\u2019-<br/><br/>GGTAGTAGAAATACCATCTTGGA-3\u2019) targeting the ORF7\u20138 regions. For samples with low Ct values, a hemi-nested PCR was then performed with primers (5\u2019-<br/><br/>TGTTTATAACACTTTGCTTCACA-3\u2019) and (5\u2019-GGTAGTAGAAATACCATCTTGGA-<br/><br/>3\u2019). The PCR mixture contained the cDNA, primers (10\u03bcM each), 10x Pfu reaction buffer (Promega), Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and dNTP mix (10mM, Thermo Scientific). The<br/><br/>PCR reaction was carried out with the following conditions: 95\u00b0C for 2 min, 35 cycles at<br/><br/>95\u00b0C for 1 min, 52\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min in a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems Veriti). Deletions in the PCR products were visualized by gel electrophoresis and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Three full \u2206382 genomes were generated and designated BetaCoV/Singapore/12/2020, BetaCoV/Singapore/13/2020 and<br/><br/>BetaCoV/Singapore/14/2020 along with five WT SARS-CoV-2 genomes previously generated in our laboratories and deposited in GISAID (see Suppl. Table 1).<br/><br/>Genomic characterization. To characterize and map the deletion regions of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, we compared with available SARS-CoV-2 and SARs-CoV related genomes from bat<br/><br/>SARs-CoV-JTMC15 (accession number: KY182964) and humans SARs-CoV-Tor 2<br/><br/>(accession number: AY274119) and LC2 (accession number: AY394999). The viral genome organizations of Wuhan-Hu-1 (accession number: MN908947) and Singapore SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>(Singapore/2 /2020: EPI_ISL_407987) comprise the following gene order and lengths: ORF1ab (open-reading frame) replicase (21291 nt), spike (S: 3822 nt), ORF3 (828 nt), envelope (E: 228 nt), membrane (M: 669 nt), ORF6 (186 nt), ORF7ab (498 nt), ORF8 (366 nt) and nucleocapsid (N: 1260 nt).<br/><br/>To understand possible effects of the TRS deletion on the ORF8 region, we analysed the total number of transcripts per million (TPM) of each gene between wildtype and \u2206382 variants.<br/><br/>For each gene, unambiguous reads which uniquely mapped to the specific joint leader and<br/><br/>TRS sequences are counted. We analysed three patients of SARS-CoV-2 wild type and two patients of SARS-CoV-2 variants and independent NGS library preparations were performed twice for each sample. The Wuhan-Hu-1 was used as the reference sequence for genomic coordinates. Leader RNA sequence is situated at the 5\u2019 UTR region of the genome and the core sequence consists of 26 nt: UCUCUAAACGAACUUUAAAAUCUGUG. Each of the coding genes is preceded by a core transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) which is highly conserved (i.e. ACGAAC), resembling the leader core sequence. The leader RNA is joined to the TRS regions of different genes and the joining is required for driving subgenomic transcription. Coding sequence (CDS), leader and TRS sequences annotations were generated in Geneious and followed published SARS-CoV studies [9]. To characterize the differential levels of TRS for each gene, 70 nt leader sequence and 230 nt downstream of each TRS sequence were annotated individually to form a 300bp leader-TRS transcript for the splicingaware aligners in R package rtracklayer (v 1.44). NGS raw fastq reads were then mapped to the reference genome by Geneious RNA-Seq mapper with the annotation of splice-junctions for the leader-TRS. For each gene, the TPM of leader-TRS was then calculated in Geneious by excluding ambiguous reads which may come from other TRS. The resulting TPM data was generated in Geneious and graphs plotted using ggplot 2 (v3.2.0) in R v3.6.1. Wilcoxon one-sided tests were performed in R to test the significant differences between WT and \u2206382 samples. We also compared individual Ct values of E and N genes between WT and \u2206382 viruses using qRT-PCR assays as previously described [18]. Samples used in this analysis included nasopharyngeal swabs from three WT patient samples and both nasopharyngeal swabs and passaged samples from two \u2206382 patients (n=7). Significance between groups was assessed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in PRISM v8.3.1.<br/><br/>Phylogenetic analyses. All available genomes of SARS-CoV-2 with associated virus sampling dates were downloaded from the GISAID database. Genome sequence alignment was performed and preliminary maximum likelihood phylogenies of complete genome were reconstructed using RAxML with 1,000 bootstrap replicates in Geneious R9.0.3 software (Biomatters Ltd). Any sequence outliers were removed from subsequent analyses. To reconstruct a time-scaled phylogeny, an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed-clock model with an exponential growth coalescent prior and the HKY85+\u0393 substitution model was used in the program BEAST v1.10.4 [20] to simultaneously estimate phylogeny, divergence times and rates of nucleotide substitution. Four independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs of 100 million generations were performed and sampled every 10,000 generations. The runs were checked for convergence in Tracer v1.7 [21] and that effective sampling size (ESS)<br/><br/>values of all parameters was >200. The resulting log and tree files were combined after removing appropriate burn-in values using LogCombiner [20], and the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was subsequently generated using TreeAnnontator [20]."

            "SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Here we report a 382-nt deletion covering almost the entire open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from eight hospitalized patients in Singapore. The deletion also removes the ORF8 transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the N gene. We also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks.",
            "During the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population [1], and similar variation has since been observed across SARS-",
            "related CoVs in humans and bats. Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in ORF8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus [2]. This is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human SARS cases possessed an ORF8 deletion that may be associated with host adaptation [1]. We therefore hypothesise that the major deletion revealed in this study may lead to an attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2.",
            "On 1 December 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged from Hubei province in China and infected people visiting the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan [3]. The virus demonstrated efficient human-to-human transmission within mainland China and subsequently spread across many countries. The virus was soon identified as 2019-nCoV, more recently designated SARS-CoV-2, while the disease is referred to as COVID-19. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International",
            "Concern. As of 10 March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to 113,702 confirmed cases and 4,012 deaths globally [4]. Zoonotic viruses have crossed the species barrier from animals to humans and the success of an interspecies transmission is the ability of a novel virus to adapt, via genetic mutation events, to a new host and cause sustained transmission that can lead to a significant outbreak.",
            "Singapore were subjected to next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis, with and without passaging in Vero-E6 cells. The NGS data revealed a 382-nt deletion towards the 3\u2019 end of the viral genomes obtained from multiple patients (Suppl. Table 1). To confirm this observation, specific PCR primers were designed flanking the deleted region and Sanger sequencing performed (Suppl. Fig. 1). This verified the deletion at positions 27,848 to 28,229 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Interrogation of the NGS assemblies of these 382-nt deletion variants (referred to hereafter as \u2206382) indicated that the virus populations were homogenous.",
            "Apart from the 382-nt deletion, the genome organization of the \u2206382 viruses is identical to that of other SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1A). Closer examination of the deletion indicated that it spans an area of the ORF7b and ORF8 that includes the ORF8 transcriptional regulator sequence (TRS), eliminating ORF8 transcription (Fig. 1B). The ORF8 region has been identified as an evolutionary hotspot of SARSr-CoVs. For instance, sequences of human",
            "SARS-CoVs has been shown to play a significant role in adaptation to the human host following interspecies transmission [7] and virus replicative efficiency [2]. Similarly the disruption of ORF8 region in \u2206382 viruses may be a result of human adaptation after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2.",
            "To investigate the possible effects of the TRS deletion, we calculated and compared the total number of transcripts per million (TPM) of each gene between wild-type (WT) and \u2206382 viruses.

Each of the coding genes is preceded by a core transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) which is highly conserved (i.e. ACGAAC), resembling the leader core sequence. The leader RNA is joined to the TRS regions of different genes and the joining is required for driving subgenomic transcription. Coding sequence (CDS), leader and TRS sequences annotations were generated in Geneious and followed published SARS-CoV studies [9]. To characterize the differential levels of TRS for each gene, 70 nt leader sequence and 230 nt downstream of each TRS sequence were annotated individually to form a 300bp leader-TRS transcript for the splicingaware aligners in R package rtracklayer (v 1.44). NGS raw fastq reads were then mapped to the reference genome by Geneious RNA-Seq mapper with the annotation of splice-junctions for the leader-TRS. For each gene, the TPM of leader-TRS was then calculated in Geneious by excluding ambiguous reads which may come from other TRS.
