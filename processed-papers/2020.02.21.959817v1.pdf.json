        "abstract": "Reverse genetics has been an indispensable tool revolutionising our insights into viral pathogenesis and vaccine development. Large RNA virus genomes, such as from Coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in E. coli hosts due to size and occasional instability[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA, which was then used to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-24 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments. The technical advance we describe here allows to rapidly responding to emerging viruses as it enables the generation and functional characterization of evolving RNA virus variants - in real-time - during an outbreak.",

This strategy proved to be successful irrespectively of the source of virus or nucleic acid template or the number of DNA fragments that were used for the one-step assembly in yeast. Of note, we were also able to clone hRSV-B, without any prior information on the virus genotype, directly from a clinical sample (nasopharyngeal aspirate) by designing RSV consensus primers to amplify 4 overlapping DNA fragments (sequence submitted to GenBank).

It took until 2000/2001 before unconventional approaches, such as cloning in low copy bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) or vaccinia virus, or cloning of subgenomic DNA fragments followed by in-vitro ligation, were successful[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. However, each system has caveats leaving the generation of recombinant coronaviruses cumbersome. We therefore aimed to assess the use of the yeast S. cerevisiae to assemble and maintain genomes of diverse RNA viruses in order to establish a rapid, stable, and universal reverse genetics pipeline for RNA viruses.",

Finally, we assessed the replication kinetics of the recovered viruses, which were indistinguishable compared to the parental MHV-GFP (Fig. 1d).",

The yeast clones containing YACs encoding MHV-GFP and MERS-CoV were passaged 15-17 times followed by re-sequencing. Results of this experiment were very supportive of the yeast-based platform (Extended Data Table 3), since the genomes could be stably maintained and no mutations arose.

This strategy proved to be successful irrespectively of the source of virus or nucleic acid template or the number of DNA fragments that were used for the one-step assembly in yeast. Of note, we were also able to clone hRSV-B, without any prior information on the virus genotype, directly from a clinical sample (nasopharyngeal aspirate) by designing RSV consensus primers to amplify 4 overlapping DNA fragments (sequence submitted to GenBank). Collectively, these results demonstrate the synthetic genomics platform provides the technical advance to rapidly generate molecular clones of diverse RNA viruses by using viral isolates, cloned DNA, synthetic DNA, and even clinical samples as starting material.",
            "The appearance of a novel CoV in China at the end of 2019 prompted us to go a step further and to test the applicability of our synthetic genomics platform to reconstruct the virus based on its released genome sequence and chemically synthesized DNA fragments. Notably, at the time when the first genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were released (Jan 10/11th, 2020) no virus isolate has been made available and it took until the end of January 2020 when successful (https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/australian-lab-cultures-new-coronavirus-asinfections-climb-67031).

Although homologous recombination in yeast has already been used for the generation of a number of molecular virus clones in the past[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>], we present here a thorough evaluation of the feasibility of this approach to rapidly generate fulllength cDNAs for large RNA viruses that have a known history of instability in E. coli. We show that one main advantage of the TAR cloning system is that the viral genomes can be fragmented to at least 14 overlapping fragments and re-assembled with remarkable efficacy (usually >90% of the clones are correct). This allowed us to complete the cloning and rescue of rSARS-CoV-2 and rSARS-CoV-2-GFP within one week. It should also be noted that we see considerable potential to reduce the time of DNA synthesis.

This allowed us to generate a molecular clone of SARS-CoV-2 by using exclusively chemically synthesized DNA, and the rescue of this version is currently in progress.",

The rapidity of our synthetic genomics approach to generate SARS-CoV-2 and the applicability to other emerging RNA viruses make this system an attractive alternative to provide infectious virus to health authorities and diagnostic laboratories without the need to have access to clinical samples. Finally, as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is ongoing, we expect to see sequence variations and possibly phenotypic changes of evolving SARS-CoV-2 in the human host.",
