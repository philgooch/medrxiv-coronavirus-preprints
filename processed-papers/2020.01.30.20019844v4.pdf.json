Further spatial spread of this disease was of great concern in view of the upcoming Spring Festival (\u201cchunyun\u201d)",
            "during which there are typically three billion travel movements over the 40-day holiday period, which runs from 15 days before the Spring Festival (Chinese Lunar New Year) to 25 days afterwards (7).",
            "As there is currently neither a vaccine nor a specific drug treatment for COVID-19, a range of public health (non-pharmaceutical) interventions has been used to control the outbreak. In an attempt to prevent further dispersal of COVID-19 from its source, all transport was prohibited in and out of Wuhan city from 10:00h on 23 January 2020, followed by the whole of Hubei Province a day later. In terms of the population covered, this appears to be the largest attempted quarantine (movement restriction) event in human history.",
            "On 23 January, China also raised its national public health response to the highest state of emergency \u2500 Level 1 of 4 levels of severity in the Chinese Emergency System, defined as an \u201cextremely serious incident\u201d (8). As part of the national emergency response, and in addition to the Wuhan city travel ban, suspected and confirmed cases have been isolated, public transport by bus and subway rail suspended, schools and entertainment venues have been closed, public gatherings banned, health checks carried out on migrants (\u201cfloating population\u201d), travel prohibited in and out of cities, and information widely disseminated. Despite all these measures, the outbreak has continued to spread geographically, within and beyond China, with mounting numbers of cases and deaths.",
            "Although the spatial spread of infectious diseases has been intensively studied (9-14), including explicit studies of the role of human movement (15, 16), the effectiveness of travel restrictions and social distancing measures in preventing the spread of infection is uncertain. For COVID-19, coronavirus transmission patterns and the impact of interventions are still poorly understood (6, 7).",

            "Festival holiday, 15 days before the Chinese Lunar New Year on 25 January and 25 days afterwards. The analysis is based on a unique geocoded repository of data on COVID-19 epidemiology, human movement, and public health (non-pharmaceutical) interventions.",
            "We first investigated the effect of the Wuhan city travel ban, comparing travel in 2020 with that in previous years and exploring the consequences of holiday travel for the dispersal of infection across China. During Spring Festival travel in 2017 and 2018, there was an average outflow of 5.2 million people from Wuhan city during the 15 days before the Chinese Lunar New Year. In 2020, this travel was interrupted by the Wuhan city shutdown, but 4.3 million people travelled out of the city between 11 January and the implementation of the ban on 23 January (7) (Fig. 2A). In 2017 and 2018, travel out of the city during the 25 days after the Chinese Lunar New Year averaged 6.7 million people each year. In 2020, the travel ban prevented almost all of that movement.",
            "The dispersal of COVID-19 from Wuhan was rapid (Fig. 3A). A total of 262 cities reported cases within 28 days. For comparison, the 2009 influenza H1N1pdm pandemic took 132 days to reach the same number of cities in China. The number of cities providing first reports of COVID-19 peaked at 59 per day on 23 January, the date of the Wuhan travel ban.",
            "The total number of cases reported from each province by 30 January, one week after the Wuhan shutdown, was strongly associated with the total number of travellers from Wuhan (r=0.98, P<0.01; excluding Hubei, r=0.69, P<0.01; Figs. 2B and 2C). COVID-19 arrived sooner in those cities that had larger populations and had more travellers from Wuhan (Tables 1 and S1). However, the Wuhan travel ban delayed the arrival time of COVID-19 in other cities by an estimated 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29 days) on average (Table 1, Fig. 3B). More than 130 cities, covering more than half the geographic area and population of China, benefited from the delay.",
            "This delay provided extra time to prepare for the arrival of COVID-19 across China but would not have curbed transmission after infection had been exported to new locations from Wuhan. Fig. 1 shows the timing and implementation of emergency control measures in 342 cities across China (see also Figs. S2 and S4). School closure, the isolation of suspected and confirmed patients, plus the disclosure of information was implemented in all cities. Public gatherings were banned and entertainment venues closed in 220 cities (64.3%). Intra-city public transport was suspended in cities (39.7%) and inter-city travel was prohibited by 219 cities (64.0%). All three measures were applied in 136 cities (Table S2).",

Among specific control measures, cities that suspended intra-city public transport and/or closed entertainment venues and banned public gatherings, and did so sooner, reported fewer cases during the first week of their outbreaks (Table",
            "2, Table S3). This analysis provided no evidence that the prohibition of travel between cities, which was implemented after and in addition to the Wuhan shutdown on 23 January, reduced the number of cases in other cities across China. These results are robust to the choice of statistical regression model (Supplementary Material, Table S3).",

The low level of peak incidence per capita, the early timing of the peak, and the subsequent decline in daily case reports, suggest that transmission control measures not only delayed the growth of the epidemic, but also greatly limited the number of cases. By fitting an epidemic model to the time series of cases reported in each province (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3), we estimate that the (basic) case reproduction number (R0) was 3.15 prior to the implementation of the emergency response on 23",
            "January (Table 3). As control was scaled-up from 23 January onwards (stage 1), the case reproduction number declined to 0.97, 2.01 and 3.05 (estimated as C1R0) in three groups of provinces, depending on the rate of implementation in each group (Tables 3 and S4). Once the implementation of interventions was 95% complete everywhere (stage 2), the case reproduction number had fallen to 0.04 on average (C2R0), far below the replacement rate (<< 1) and consistent with the rapid decline in incidence (Fig. 4A, Fig. S5, Table 3, Table S4).",

Therefore neither of these interventions would, on their own, have reversed the rise in incidence by 19 February (Fig. 4B). But together and interactively, these control measures evidently did halt and reverse the rise in incidence, limiting the number of confirmed cases reported to 29,839 (fitted model estimate 28,000 \u00b1 1400 cases), a 96% reduction on the total number of cases expected in the absence of interventions.",

            "2009. In addition, the COVID-19 epidemic began just before the period of intense travel during the Spring Festival holiday. Nevertheless, the Wuhan city travel ban provided extra time to implement transmission control measures in other parts of China and, once established, these were an additional powerful force in curtailing and reversing the epidemic.",
            "The number of people who have developed COVID-19 during this epidemic, and therefore the number of people who were protected by control measures, is not known precisely, given that cases were almost certainly under-reported. However, in view of the small fraction of people known to have been infected by 19 February (75,532 cases, 5.41 per 100,000 population), it is unlikely that the spread of infection was halted and epidemic growth reversed because the supply of susceptible people had been exhausted. This implies that a large fraction of the Chinese population remains at risk of COVID-19; relaxing control measures could lead to a resurgence of transmission. Further investigations are needed to verify that proposition, and population surveys of infection are needed to reveal the true number of people who have been exposed to this novel coronavirus.",
            "We could not investigate the impact of all elements of the national emergency response because many were introduced simultaneously across China. However, there is firm evidence from the data used in this analysis that suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings, which were introduced at different times in different places, contributed to the overall containment of the epidemic. Other factors are likely to have contributed to control, such as the isolation of suspected and confirmed patients, contact tracing and the closure of schools, and it is not yet clear which parts of the national emergency response were most effective. We did not find that prohibiting travel between cities or provinces reduced the numbers of COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan and Hubei, perhaps because such travel bans were implemented as a response to, rather than in anticipation of, the arrival of COVID-19.",
            "This study has drawn inferences, not from a controlled experiment, but from statistical and mathematical analyses of the temporal and spatial variation in case reports, human mobility and transmission control measures. With that caveat, we conclude that these control measures had a major impact on the COVID-19 epidemic, averting hundreds of thousands of cases by 19 Feburary.",
            "Whether the means and the outcomes of control can be replicated outside China, and which of the interventions are most effective, are now under intense investigation as the virus continues to spread worldwide."

            "We could not investigate the impact of all elements of the national emergency response because many were introduced simultaneously across China. However, there is firm evidence from the data used in this analysis that suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings, which were introduced at different times in different places, contributed to the overall containment of the epidemic. Other factors are likely to have contributed to control, such as the isolation of suspected and confirmed patients, contact tracing and the closure of schools, and it is not yet clear which parts of the national emergency response were most effective. We did not find that prohibiting travel between cities or provinces reduced the numbers of COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan and Hubei, perhaps because such travel bans were implemented as a response to, rather than in anticipation of, the arrival of COVID-19.",
            "This study has drawn inferences, not from a controlled experiment, but from statistical and mathematical analyses of the temporal and spatial variation in case reports, human mobility and transmission control measures. With that caveat, we conclude that these control measures had a major impact on the COVID-19 epidemic, averting hundreds of thousands of cases by 19 Feburary.",
            "Whether the means and the outcomes of control can be replicated outside China, and which of the interventions are most effective, are now under intense investigation as the virus continues to spread worldwide."

However, the model describes the data accurately (Fig. 4A, Fig. S3) and these assumptions are unlikely to affect the principal conclusions of the analysis, which apply only to the first 50 days of the epidemic. The basic reproductive number of the model is R0 =\u03b2/\u03b3, where \u03b2 is the per capita transmission rate per day and 1/\u03b4 and 1/\u03b3 are, respectively, the mean latent and infectious periods.",
