        "abstract": "Background: Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, due to the low viral load in patient throat and the limitation of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which should not be ignored. Methods: We explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 57 clinical pharyngeal swab samples and compared with RT-PCR 39 in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. Among 57 samples, all of which were 40 reported as negative nucleic acid by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection, 43 41 samples were collected from suspected patients with fever in clinic, and 14 were from supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment. The experiment was double-blind. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimized ddPCR is at least 500 times lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of ddPCR for clinical detection is 94.3 %. 33 out of 35 negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were correctly judged by ddPCR based on the follow-up investigation. In addition, 9 out of 14 (64.2 %) supposed convalescents with negative nucleic acid test twice by RT-PCR were positive by ddPCR detection. Conclusions: ddPCR shows superiority for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negatives, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR. Before the ddPCR to be approved for diagnosis, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary.",

The presence of two positive droplets or more was not observed for negative controls.

It shows good linearity (R2: 0.9932 and 0.9824, respectively) (Fig. 1A and 1B). Reportable range of ddPCR is from 10 copies/\u03bcl to 2500 copies/\u03bcl for both ORF1ab and N primes/probe sets.

However, chest CT of these 8 patients did not show any abnormalities upon their first visit the clinic. According to official clinical guidelines, these 8 patients were home quarantined and no further followed-up by us (Table 1).<br/><br/>Finally, pharyngeal swabs of 14 supposed convalescent were tested negative in two consecutive tests by RT-PCR (Table 2). However, using ddPCR, 9 out of 14 were positive with a positive rate of 64.2 %. Therefore, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary.<br/><br/>In conclusion, compared with RT-PCR, ddPCR show superiority for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negatives, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR.",
            "<strong>Results in this work proved that</strong><br/><br/>ddPCR is more sensitive (Fig. 1) and accurate for low viral load diagnosis (Fig. 2), which can greatly reduce the false negatives detection (Fig 3).<br/><br/>Based on two primers/probe sets targeting ORF1ab and N of SARS-CoV-2, results showed that N primers/probe set was more sensitive compared to that of ORF1ab.<br/><br/>Among 42 samples that were judged as positive with ddPCR, 40 in 42 were detected as positive by N primers/probe set, and 12 in 42 were detected as positive by ORF1ab primers/probe set. This could be explained by the subgenomic RNA discontinuous<br/><br/>In the replication and transcription model of coronavirus. The genome RNA of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 encodes single copy of ORF1ab and N, respectively. In contrast, a nested set of around 10 subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs), each of which encodes one copy of N, are synthesized by viral replication and transcription complex in a manner of discontinuous transcription .18,19,20 Therefore, the copy numbers of N gene is significantly higher than that of ORF1ab gene in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.<br/><br/>Although 2 patients, who were clinically confirmed by chest CT and RT-PCR subsequently, were reported as negative nucleic acid in pharyngeal swabs by our ddPCR, leading to 2 false negative reports by ddPCR in 35 cases (5.7 % missing rate), the overall accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 detection is significantly improved, which will benefit to the early diagnosis, intervention and treatment.<br/><br/>Notably, 64.2 % supposed convalescent patients, who are negative for pharyngeal swab nucleic acid tests twice by RT-PCR, are still carrying SARS-CoV-2 based on our work.

        "discussion": [
            "More and more nucleic acid detection kits have been developed for SARS-CoV-2 recently based on RT-PCR to meet the requirement of large-scale clinical molecular diagnosis. It has been reported that 6 kinds of RT-PCR detection kits were compared and analyzed for their detection performance. Results showed that there are differences in the detection ability of these kits for weakly positive samples, and the accuracy, sensitivity and reproducibility of some reagents are not ideal meantime, many efforts have been focusing on developing better and complementary technology for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, due to the limited sensitivity and precision of RT-PCR for viral quantitation. Different from RT-PCR that the data are measured from a single amplification curve and a Cq value, which is highly dependent on reaction efficiency, primer dimers and sample contaminants, ddPCR is measured at reaction end point which virtually eliminates these potential pitfalls."

Lower limit of quantitation (LLoQ) and LLoD were defined as the lowest concentration at which 95 % and 50 % of positive samples were detected, respectively."

        "Discussion": [
            "More and more nucleic acid detection kits have been developed for SARS-CoV-2 recently based on RT-PCR to meet the requirement of large-scale clinical molecular diagnosis. It has been reported that 6 kinds of RT-PCR detection kits were compared and analyzed for their detection performance. Results showed that there are differences in the detection ability of these kits for weakly positive samples, and the accuracy, sensitivity and reproducibility of some reagents are not ideal meantime, many efforts have been focusing on developing better and complementary technology for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, due to the limited sensitivity and precision of RT-PCR for viral quantitation. Different from RT-PCR that the data are measured from a single amplification curve and a Cq value, which is highly dependent on reaction efficiency, primer dimers and sample contaminants, ddPCR is measured at reaction end point which virtually eliminates these potential pitfalls.",
            "Results in this work proved that ddPCR is more sensitive (Fig. 1) and accurate for low viral load diagnosis (Fig. 2), which can greatly reduce the false negatives detection (Fig 3).",
            "Based on two primers/probe sets targeting ORF1ab and N of SARS-CoV-2, results showed that N primers/probe set was more sensitive compared to that of ORF1ab.",
            "Among 42 samples that were judged as positive with ddPCR, 40 in 42 were detected as positive by N primers/probe set, and 12 in 42 were detected as positive by ORF1ab primers/probe set. This could be explained by the subgenomic RNA discontinuous",
            "SARS-CoV-2 encodes single copy of ORF1ab and N, respectively. In contrast, a nested set of around 10 subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs), each of which encodes one copy of N, are synthesized by viral replication and transcription complex in a manner of discontinuous transcription .18,19,20 Therefore, the copy numbers of N gene is significantly higher than that of ORF1ab gene in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.",
            "Although 2 patients, who were clinically confirmed by chest CT and RT-PCR subsequently, were reported as negative nucleic acid in pharyngeal swabs by our ddPCR, leading to 2 false negative reports by ddPCR in 35 cases (5.7 % missing rate), the overall accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 detection is significantly improved, which will benefit to the early diagnosis, intervention and treatment.",
            "Notably, 64.2 % supposed convalescent patients, who are negative for pharyngeal swab nucleic acid tests twice by RT-PCR, are still carrying SARS-CoV-2 based on our work. Although there is no evidence that such COVID-19 convalescent carrying",
            "SARS-CoV-2 will be infectious to other healthy person, the risk still exists. Therefore, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary. And we recommend that ddPCR could be a complement to the current standard RT-PCR to re-confirm the convalescent, which will benefit to reduce the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and social panic.",
            "YC, KL conceptualized the study design. TS, WH, LD, TC, YX, and GC recruited the patients, collected specimens, collected demographic, clinical data; XL, MG, QZ, XW, YY, MS, DG and ZH did the laboratory tests.
