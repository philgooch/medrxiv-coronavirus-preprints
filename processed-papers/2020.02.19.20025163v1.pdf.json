            "In conclusion, our latest estimates of the risk of 2019-Cov deaths in China could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas this estimate is around 1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas in China as of February 5th, 2020. Because it is likely that the death risk from 2019-nCov is associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions (vaccination and antiviral drugs), enhanced public health interventions including social distancing, quarantine, enhanced infection control in healthcare settings and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to rapidly contain this epidemic."

            "Data sources<br/><br/>We use two different types of data. First, daily confirmed cases and deaths in China were extracted from daily reports published by China government, Hubei Province in China and<br/><br/>Wuhan City [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. These data were categorized by area of Wuhan City, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan City or China excluding Hubei Province, considering that over 50% of the deaths are occurring in Hubei Province. In particular, the great majority of the deaths have occurred in Wuhan City. The diagnosis of 20190-nCov cases relies solely on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as rapid diagnostic tests for this novel coronavirus are yet to be developed.<br/><br/>Second, fifty epidemiological descriptions of the patients who died of 2019-nCov infection were obtained from several sources [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. After checking for duplication and missing data, the sample size of delays from onset to death and from hospitalization to death was 39 and<br/><br/>33, respectively. We fitted a gamma distribution, an exponential distribution and a lognormal distribution to the distributions and selected the best model based on the AIC. (Figure S1-S2, Case fatality ratio<br/><br/>Crude CFR is defined as the number of cumulative cases divided by the number of cumulative deaths at a specific point in time. For the estimation of CFR in real time, we employ the delay from hospitalization to death, hs, which is assumed to be given by hs = H(s) \u2013 H(s-1) for s>0 where H(s) follows a gamma distribution with mean 10.1 days and SD 5.4 days, obtained from the available observed data. Let \u03c0 be the time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio, the likelihood function of the estimate \u03c0 is    , ;  , ,    \u2211<br/><br/>\u2211  , where ca,t represents the number of new cases with reported day t in area a, and Da,t is the number of new deaths with reported day ti in area a [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].

        "discussion": [
            "In this paper we have derived estimates of the CFR for the ongoing 2019-nCov outbreak in China. We have estimated time-delay adjusted CFR in three different areas in China and found that the most severely affected areas are Wuhan City as well as the Hubei Province excluding<br/><br/>Wuhan City while the rest of China exhibits a milder impact (China excluding Hubei Province).<br/><br/>We found that the latest estimates of the delay adjusted CFR in Wuhan City is as high as<br/><br/>18.9% (95%CrI: 17.1-20.8%), an estimate that his 3-fold higher than our estimate for Hubei<br/><br/>Province excluding Wuhan City and around 20-fold higher than our estimate for China excluding<br/><br/>Hubei Province. These findings suggest that the ongoing situation in Wuhan is particularly dire compared to the other affected areas. Upward trend of CFR at the early phase generally indicates a deterioration of an ascertainment bias.<br/><br/>However, this upward trend should be interpreted with caution. In particular, the difficulties in diagnosis cases of 2019-Cov because the associated symptoms are not specific.<br/><br/>Further, the fraction of 2019-Cov patients who develop mild symptoms including asymptomatic patients is not minor, which complicates detection and diagnosis early after symptoms onset, leading to ascertainment bias [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Indeed, out of a total of 566 Japanese returnees who evacuated Wuhan city by government-chartered plane during January 29-31 in 2020, a total of 5 asymptomatic and 4 symptomatic 2019-nCov cases were detected after detailed medical examination [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. However, considering that this underestimation occurred during the course of outbreak and the number of deaths is relatively accurately reported, the upward trend indicates that the temporal disease burden exceeded the capacity of medical facilities and the surveillance system likely missed many cases during the early phase. Additionally, hospital-based transmission is likely occurring, affecting healthcare workers, inpatients and visitors to medical facilities, which could explain an increase trend and elevated CFR estimates. Indeed, nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS nosocomial outbreaks have been reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Inpatients with underlying disease or seniors infected in the hospital setting have raised the CFR to values as high as 20% for MERS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. More generally, 2019-nCov transmission is facilitated in confined settings. For instance, a large cluster of 2019-Cov secondary infection has been reported aboard a cruise ship, with 61 confirmed cases representing about a fifth of the people tested for the virus, supporting high transmissibility of 2019-nCov in confined conditions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].<br/><br/>A downward trend in CFR is suggestive of the extent of improvements in epidemiological surveillance. In addition, this pattern indirectly supports a significant number of mild or asymptomatic cases in Wuhan City, and the underlying transmission might prolong the end of the outbreak or further transmission to other areas unless effective social distancing measures are implemented while a vaccine becomes available. Furthermore, given that both the delay adjusted CFR and crude CFR estimates in Wuhan City are around 20-fold higher than our estimates for China excluding Hubei Province suggests a breakdown in medical care delivery and points to the critical need for urgent medical support in the epicenter of the epidemic.<br/><br/>We also found that the estimates of delay adjusted CFR both in in Hubei Province excluding Wuhan City and in China excluding Hubei Province show a time-dependent declining trend as the epidemic progresses. Indeed, a similar trend has been previously reported for the<br/><br/>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015, where a significant fraction of the cases had comorbidities or were senior patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. If the proportion of vulnerable cases is high at the early phase and gets proportionally smaller in the later stage of the outbreak, this partly explains the time dependent decline. However, since the epidemic has yet to peak, this time dependent decrease is likely caused by ascertainment bias.<br/><br/>Moreover, both of the latest estimates of the delay adjusted CFR and crude CFR in Hubei<br/><br/>Province are around 6-7 fold higher than that in China excluding Hubei Province, where the health care system has not reached peak capacity. This also indicates the need to anticipate for additional medical support to deliver medical care to the most vulnerable and at highest risk of succumbing to the disease from underlying medical conditions.<br/><br/>Our study is not free from limitations. First, our CFR estimate is influenced by ascertainment bias and this might influence estimates upwards. For those infectious diseases characterized by a large fraction cases with mild or asymptomatic illness, the infection fatality risk, e.g., the number of death divided by the total infected, is a more appropriate index of disease burden [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. For this purpose, mass serological surveillance and surveys to assess the presence/absence of symptoms is strongly recommended to disentangle the threat of emerging infectious diseases including 2019-nCov.<br/><br/>Second, in our estimation we employed the time delay distribution from illness onset to deaths (N=39), which was obtained from secondary sources, but the available data does not include either the date of illness onset or the confirmed date. For this reason, we utilized the time delay from hospitalization to death (N=33).<br/><br/>In conclusion, our latest estimates of the risk of 2019-Cov deaths in China could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas this estimate is around 1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas in China as of February 5th, 2020. Because it is likely that the death risk from 2019-nCov is associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions (vaccination and antiviral drugs), enhanced public health interventions including social distancing, quarantine, enhanced infection control in healthcare settings and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to rapidly contain this epidemic."

However, considering that this underestimation occurred during the course of outbreak and the number of deaths is relatively accurately reported, the upward trend indicates that the temporal disease burden exceeded the capacity of medical facilities and the surveillance system likely missed many cases during the early phase. Additionally, hospital-based transmission is likely occurring, affecting healthcare workers, inpatients and visitors to medical facilities, which could explain an increase trend and elevated CFR estimates. Indeed, nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS nosocomial outbreaks have been reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Inpatients with underlying disease or seniors infected in the hospital setting have raised the CFR to values as high as 20% for MERS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. More generally, 2019-nCov transmission is facilitated in confined settings. For instance, a large cluster of 2019-Cov secondary infection has been reported aboard a cruise ship, with 61 confirmed cases representing about a fifth of the people tested for the virus, supporting high transmissibility of 2019-nCov in confined conditions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].",
            "A downward trend in CFR is suggestive of the extent of improvements in epidemiological surveillance. In addition, this pattern indirectly supports a significant number of mild or asymptomatic cases in Wuhan City, and the underlying transmission might prolong the end of the outbreak or further transmission to other areas unless effective social distancing measures are implemented while a vaccine becomes available. Furthermore, given that both the delay adjusted CFR and crude CFR estimates in Wuhan City are around 20-fold higher than our estimates for China excluding Hubei Province suggests a breakdown in medical care delivery and points to the critical need for urgent medical support in the epicenter of the epidemic.",
            "We also found that the estimates of delay adjusted CFR both in in Hubei Province excluding Wuhan City and in China excluding Hubei Province show a time-dependent declining trend as the epidemic progresses. Indeed, a similar trend has been previously reported for the",
            "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015, where a significant fraction of the cases had comorbidities or were senior patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. If the proportion of vulnerable cases is high at the early phase and gets proportionally smaller in the later stage of the outbreak, this partly explains the time dependent decline. However, since the epidemic has yet to peak, this time dependent decrease is likely caused by ascertainment bias.",
            "Moreover, both of the latest estimates of the delay adjusted CFR and crude CFR in Hubei",
            "Province are around 6-7 fold higher than that in China excluding Hubei Province, where the health care system has not reached peak capacity. This also indicates the need to anticipate for additional medical support to deliver medical care to the most vulnerable and at highest risk of succumbing to the disease from underlying medical conditions.",
            "Our study is not free from limitations. First, our CFR estimate is influenced by ascertainment bias and this might influence estimates upwards. For those infectious diseases characterized by a large fraction cases with mild or asymptomatic illness, the infection fatality risk, e.g., the number of death divided by the total infected, is a more appropriate index of disease burden [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. For this purpose, mass serological surveillance and surveys to assess the presence/absence of symptoms is strongly recommended to disentangle the threat of emerging infectious diseases including 2019-nCov.",
            "Second, in our estimation we employed the time delay distribution from illness onset to deaths (N=39), which was obtained from secondary sources, but the available data does not include either the date of illness onset or the confirmed date. For this reason, we utilized the time delay from hospitalization to death (N=33).",
            "In conclusion, our latest estimates of the risk of 2019-Cov deaths in China could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas this estimate is around 1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas in China as of February 5th, 2020. Because it is likely that the death risk from 2019-nCov is associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions (vaccination and antiviral drugs), enhanced public health interventions including social distancing, quarantine, enhanced infection control in healthcare settings and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to rapidly contain this epidemic."
