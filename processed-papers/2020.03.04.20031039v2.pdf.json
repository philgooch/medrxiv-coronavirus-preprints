        "abstract": "Rationale: COVID-19 have deprived many lives in Wuhan, China and caused global concerns. Few studies focused on clinical characteristics non-survivors hospitalized with COVID-19.\nObjectives: We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of died patients with COVID-19 and tracked the causes of the rapid disease progression and death.\nMethods: 101 non-surviving patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Clinical data were collected and compared between non-survivors who died within 3 days and after 3 days of admission. Multivariable regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors associated with rapid disease progression and death.\nMeasurements and Main Results: Among included patients, median age was 71 years (IQR, 59-80), 60 (59.41%) were men. 82 (81.19%) had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (59 [58.42%]), diabetes (22 [21.78%]) etc. 100 (99.01%) suffered respiratory failure, 53 (52.48%) developed acute cardiac injury, acute kidney and liver injury occurred in 23 (22.77%) and 18 (17.82%) patients, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that elevated high sensitivity troponin I (OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.31-5.49, P=0.007), neutrophils (OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.01-1.28, P=0.033) and depressed oxygen saturation (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.89-0.99, P=0.027) on admission were associated with rapid death of patients with COVID-19.",

Running Head: Clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19 Descriptor: 10.14 Pneumonia: Viral Infections  Word Count: 2618 At a Glance Commentary Scientific Knowledge on the Subject COVID-19 have deprived many lives and caused global concerns. We searched PubMed for articles published up to Mar 10, 2020, using the keywords \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, or \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d. We identified that few studies focused on clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19. What This Study Adds to the Field We reported the demographic and clinical characteristics of 101 non-surviving hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This study showed that older patients (>70 years) with comorbidities had a steeply increased risk of death when they suffered COVID19. Besides, respiratory failure, acute cardiac and kidney injury played a crucial role in the rapid death of patients. Furthermore, multivariable regression analysis revealed elevated levels of high sensitivity troponin I, neutrophils and depressed oxygen saturation were associated with increased odds of rapid death of patients with COVID19."

The median age was 71 years (IQR, 59-80; range, 35-100 years). 60 (59.41%) were male. There were 57(56.44%) cases whose age over 70 years (31 cases in 70-79y; 20 cases in 80-89y; and 6 cases in more than 90y) (Table 1 and Figure 1A). The median duration from hospital admission to death was 4 days (IQR, 2-7d). The most common symptoms were fever (82 cases, [81.19%]), dyspnea (59 cases, [58.42%]), dry cough (56 cases, [55.45%]), fatigue (36 cases, [35.64%]), expectoration (21 cases, [20.79%]) and diarrhea (10 cases, [9.90%]). Other less common symptoms were anorexia, myalgia, abdominal pain and distension, headache, nausea and vomiting, pharyngalgia, haematemesis and melena, hemoptysis. (Table 1)<br/><br/>We compared the demographic, presenting characteristics and vital signs on admission between patients died within 3 days and those survived 3 days of admission. 48 cases (47.52%) died within 3 days of admission, median age was 72 years (IQR, 59-78; range, 30-94 years), 28 (58.33%) were males. 53 cases (52.48%) died after 3 days, median age was 71 years (IQR, 59-81; range, 31-100 years), 32 (60.38%) were males. Compared with patients who survived 3 days, those died within 3 days of admission exhibited significantly higher respiration rate (25 vs 20) and heart rate (97 vs 84) at presentation. There were no significant differences of self-report symptoms between two groups including fever, dyspnea, cough, fatigue etc. (Table 1). 81 (81.19%) patients had more than one underling medical conditions. Documented comorbidities including hypertension (58.42%), cardiovascular disease (23.76%), diabetes (21.78%), chronic pulmonary disease (13.86%), cerebrovascular disease (12.87%), chronic kidney disease (10.89%) and malignancy (6.93%) (Table 2). . Regarding to organ functions, 100 (99.01%) patients developed acute respiratory failure, 53 (52.48%) had acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury were developed in 23 cases (22.77%), acute liver dysfunction were found in 18 cases (17.82%) and 14 (13.86%) suffered coagulation disorders among which one patient was died of massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding. (Table 2 and Figure 1B)<br/><br/>There were quite a lot differences of laboratory parameters between patients who died within 3 days and those survived 3 days of admission. Patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (12.36 \u00d7109 vs 7.72\u00d7109/L), neutrophil count (11.23\u00d7109 vs 6.48\u00d7109/L). For other biochemical indexes, elevated C-reactive protein (123.4 \u00b1 10.85 vs 94.10 \u00b1 9.26 mg/L), procalcitonin (2.26 vs 0.58 ng/ml), hsTnI (1.98 vs 0.2 ng/ml), Creatine kinase-MB (6.14 vs 2.78 ng/ml), myoglobin (437.7 vs 216.8 ug/L) and BUN (15.2 vs 10.08 mmol/L) were over normal range and significantly higher in patients died within 3 days of admission (Table 3). Blood gas analyses showed patients died within 3 days presented with significantly lower oxygen saturation (80.58% vs 88.37%), higher lactate level (3.80 vs 2.62 mmol/L) and lower pH value (7.40 vs 7.42) compared with those survived 3 days (Table 3). Cellular and humoral immunity analysis also revealed several differences. Mean CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were all below normal ranges in patients died within 3 days and those survived 3 days which suggested impaired immunity in these patients. Compared with those survived 3 days, CD3+ and CD8+ percentages were significantly lower in patients died within 3 days (Table 3). Level of C3 complement was within normal range in both groups with a significantly higher titration in patients died within 3 days compared with those survived 3 days (1.03 vs 0.89 g/L) (Table 3). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were used to evaluate the features of lung injury. Patients suffered severe lung damage and their lung imaging features presented the vast or merged glass shadow, but quantitation of lung lobe injury and injury score revealed no significant difference between patients died within 3 days and those survived 3 days of admission (Table 3 and Figure 2).<br/><br/>Among treatment strategies, most patients received antiviral therapy (96.04%) and antibacterial therapy (98.02%), 44 (43.56%) received glucocorticoid therapy, 36 (35.64%) received gamma globulin inhalation. 78 (77.23%) received high flow oxygen inhalation, 41 (40.59%) received noninvasive ventilation while 14 (13.86%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 5 (4.95%) received continuous renal replacement therapy (Table 4).<br/><br/>In univariable analysis, elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, procalcitonin, hsTnI, Creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin, BUN, C3 complement, lactate and decreased CD3+ cell percentage, CD8+ cell percentage, oxygen saturation were associated with rapid death within 3 days of admission. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated high sensitivity troponin I (OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.31-5.49, P=0.007), neutrophils (OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.01-1.28, P=0.033) and depressed oxygen saturation (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.89-0.99, P=0.027) were associated with increased odds of rapid disease progression death within 3 days of hospital admission (Table 5)."

            "This report, to our knowledge, is the largest case series to analyze died patients with COVID-19 in hospital. As of February 15, 2020, 101 patients died because of COVID19 were included in this study. We aimed to present the clinical features, organ dysfunction, laboratory indicators of the 101 non-survivors, and analyze possible causes and risk factors accounted for the rapid progress of disease and death. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical features and treatment measures of COVID-19 posed huge challenge for our clinical practice. Although previous study reported the mortality of patients with COVID-19 is 1.4% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], some special population including the aged and individuals with underlying comorbidities may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our cohort, the median age of non-survivors was 71 years, 81.19% of them combined with one or more underlying medical conditions including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and malignancy. This study suggested that patients aged over 70 years with chronic medical conditions were more likely to suffer a severe attack and death.<br/><br/>Common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 were fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue etc. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In our cohort, we observed that, besides fever and cough, dyspnea (58.42%) presented early in most non-survivors with confirmed COVID-19, similar finding has also been observed in critically ill patients reported by Yang etc. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. In these nonsurvivors, featured complications during hospitalization including ARDS and respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury, AKI, acute liver injury and abnormal coagulation. In terms of SARS, severe respiratory failure was the leading cause of mortality, with little other organ failure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. It is surprised that we observed 52.48% and 22.77% non-survivors suffered heart failure and AKI, respectively. Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial SARS-CoV-2 receptor, distributed widely in heart, kidney and intestine etc. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Whether SARS-CoV-2 attack heart and kidney or other vital organs directly need to be confirmed further.<br/><br/>The most common laboratory abnormalities observed in this study were elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, hsTnI, BUN and decreased oxygen saturation etc. Compared with those survived 3 days of admission, nonsurvivors died within 3 days had numerous different findings including depressed percentages of lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD8+ cells, and elevated white blood cell count, hsTnI and BUN. These evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with cellular immune deficiency and lead to acute myocardial injury and kidney injury. These results also support the described organ injury above. In addition, the characteristic chest CT imaging of these non-survivors were evaluated by previous described method [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. The CT features demonstrated extensive infection and severe damage, regarded as \u201cwhite lung\u201d, in five lobes, but no significant difference was found between the two groups. These characteristics combined with above repented organ failure, laboratory abnormalities suggested that early organ dysfunction or failure were responsible for rapid progression of disease and death of the patients.<br/><br/>Up to now, no antiviral treatment has been recommended for coronavirus treatment except supportive care and organ support [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. In current clinical practice, arbidol was used as an antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, but the efficacy remains to be proved. Other antiviral medications including remdesivir, lopinavir and traditional Chinese medicine are still being verified in clinical trials. Furthermore, application of intravenous immunoglobulin is recommended to enhance the ability of anti-infection for critically ill patients and steroids are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short duration of treatment as possible [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. In this study, 96.04% patients received antiviral therapy, 98.02% received antibacterial therapy. Application of glucocorticoid mainly depended on the severity of inflammatory response. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, all the non-survivors received oxygen inhalation therapy including high flow oxygen inhalation (77.23%), but quite a low proportion of patients received machine ventilation partly due to limited medical resources against the steeply increasing number of patients at early outbreak.<br/><br/>To explore the risk factors associated with the rapid progress of disease and death, multivariable regression analysis was performed. In this study, 100 (99.01%), 53 (52.48%) and 23 (22.77%) non-survivors suffered respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury, respectively. Univariable analysis indicated elevated hsTnI, myoglobin, creatine kinase-MB, BUN, lactate and decreased oxygen saturation were associated with increased risk of death within 3 days of admission. Representative indicators associated with organs injury including hsTnI, BUN and oxygen saturation were selected and included in multivariable regression analysis. Usually, the level of neutrophils is slightly elevated or normal in virus infections, but significantly elevated neutrophils were observed in this rapid death of patients in our study. Viral infections may impair the immune system and facilitate opportunistic infection and neutrophils are crucial in protection of bacterial infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. So, neutrophil count was also included in our multivariable regression analysis. The median age of 101 died patients with COVID-19 were 71 years (IQR, 59-80) which was older compared to recent report [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. We also included age in multivariable analysis although median age of patients died within 3 days and survived 3 days of admission did not have significant difference, because older age has been reported to be associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that decreased oxygen saturation, increased neutrophil count and elevated hsTnI on admission were associated with increased odds of rapid death within 3 days of hospital admission. Early detection of these factors could help physicians to identify rapid progress of disease and death of patients with COVID-19.<br/><br/>Several limitations existed in this study. Firstly, evaluation of CT imaging features partly depended on the experience of clinicians and radiologists which may cause inaccuracy. Secondly, in the early outbreak of COVID-19, relatively inadequate medical resources may affect the observation of the natural course of disease. Finally, only 101 patients died with COVID-19 in one hospital were included in this study, further studies including multi-centers are still needed."

The median duration from hospital admission to death was 4 days (IQR, 2-7d). The most common symptoms were fever (82 cases, [81.19%]), dyspnea (59 cases, [58.42%]), dry cough (56 cases, [55.45%]), fatigue (36 cases, [35.64%]), expectoration (21 cases, [20.79%]) and diarrhea (10 cases, [9.90%]). Other less common symptoms were anorexia, myalgia, abdominal pain and distension, headache, nausea and vomiting, pharyngalgia, haematemesis and melena, hemoptysis. (Table 1)",
            "We compared the demographic, presenting characteristics and vital signs on admission between patients died within 3 days and those survived 3 days of admission. 48 cases (47.52%) died within 3 days of admission, median age was 72 years (IQR, 59-78; range, 30-94 years), 28 (58.33%) were males. 53 cases (52.48%) died after 3 days, median age was 71 years (IQR, 59-81; range, 31-100 years), 32 (60.38%) were males. Compared with patients who survived 3 days, those died within 3 days of admission exhibited significantly higher respiration rate (25 vs 20) and heart rate (97 vs 84) at presentation. There were no significant differences of self-report symptoms between two groups including fever, dyspnea, cough, fatigue etc. (Table 1). 81 (81.19%) patients had more than one underling medical conditions. Documented comorbidities including hypertension (58.42%), cardiovascular disease (23.76%), diabetes (21.78%), chronic pulmonary disease (13.86%), cerebrovascular disease (12.87%), chronic kidney disease (10.89%) and malignancy (6.93%) (Table 2). . Regarding to organ functions, 100 (99.01%) patients developed acute respiratory failure, 53 (52.48%) had acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury were developed in 23 cases (22.77%), acute liver dysfunction were found in 18 cases (17.82%) and 14 (13.86%) suffered coagulation disorders among which one patient was died of massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding. (Table 2 and Figure 1B)",
            "There were quite a lot differences of laboratory parameters between patients who died within 3 days and those survived 3 days of admission. Patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (12.36 \u00d7109 vs 7.72\u00d7109/L), neutrophil count (11.23\u00d7109 vs 6.48\u00d7109/L). For other biochemical indexes, elevated C-reactive protein (123.4 \u00b1 10.85 vs 94.10 \u00b1 9.26 mg/L), procalcitonin (2.26 vs 0.58 ng/ml), hsTnI (1.98 vs 0.2 ng/ml), Creatine kinase-MB (6.14 vs 2.78 ng/ml), myoglobin (437.7 vs 216.8 ug/L) and BUN (15.2 vs 10.08 mmol/L) were over normal range and significantly higher in patients died within 3 days of admission (Table 3). Blood gas analyses showed patients died within 3 days presented with significantly lower oxygen saturation (80.58% vs 88.37%), higher lactate level (3.80 vs 2.62 mmol/L) and lower pH value (7.40 vs 7.42) compared with those survived 3 days (Table 3). Cellular and humoral immunity analysis also revealed several differences. Mean CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were all below normal ranges in patients died within 3 days and those survived 3 days which suggested impaired immunity in these patients. Compared with those survived 3 days, CD3+ and CD8+ percentages were significantly lower in patients died within 3 days (Table 3). Level of C3 complement was within normal range in both groups with a significantly higher titration in patients died within 3 days compared with those survived 3 days (1.03 vs 0.89 g/L) (Table 3). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were used to evaluate the features of lung injury. Patients suffered severe lung damage and their lung imaging features presented the vast or merged glass shadow, but quantitation of lung lobe injury and injury score revealed no significant difference between patients died within 3 days and those survived 3 days of admission (Table 3 and Figure 2).",
            "Among treatment strategies, most patients received antiviral therapy (96.04%) and antibacterial therapy (98.02%), 44 (43.56%) received glucocorticoid therapy, 36 (35.64%) received gamma globulin inhalation. 78 (77.23%) received high flow oxygen inhalation, 41 (40.59%) received noninvasive ventilation while 14 (13.86%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 5 (4.95%) received continuous renal replacement therapy (Table 4).",
            "In univariable analysis, elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, procalcitonin, hsTnI, Creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin, BUN, C3 complement, lactate and decreased CD3+ cell percentage, CD8+ cell percentage, oxygen saturation were associated with rapid death within 3 days of admission. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated high sensitivity troponin I (OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.31-5.49, P=0.007), neutrophils (OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.01-1.28, P=0.033) and depressed oxygen saturation (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.89-0.99, P=0.027) were associated with increased odds of rapid disease progression death within 3 days of hospital admission (Table 5)."

        "Discussion": [
            "This report, to our knowledge, is the largest case series to analyze died patients with COVID-19 in hospital. As of February 15, 2020, 101 patients died because of COVID19 were included in this study. We aimed to present the clinical features, organ dysfunction, laboratory indicators of the 101 non-survivors, and analyze possible causes and risk factors accounted for the rapid progress of disease and death. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical features and treatment measures of COVID-19 posed huge challenge for our clinical practice. Although previous study reported the mortality of patients with COVID-19 is 1.4% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], some special population including the aged and individuals with underlying comorbidities may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our cohort, the median age of non-survivors was 71 years, 81.19% of them combined with one or more underlying medical conditions including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and malignancy. This study suggested that patients aged over 70 years with chronic medical conditions were more likely to suffer a severe attack and death.",
            "Common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 were fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue etc. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In our cohort, we observed that, besides fever and cough, dyspnea (58.42%) presented early in most non-survivors with confirmed COVID-19, similar finding has also been observed in critically ill patients reported by Yang etc. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. In these nonsurvivors, featured complications during hospitalization including ARDS and respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury, AKI, acute liver injury and abnormal coagulation. In terms of SARS, severe respiratory failure was the leading cause of mortality, with little other organ failure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. It is surprised that we observed 52.48% and 22.77% non-survivors suffered heart failure and AKI, respectively. Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial SARS-CoV-2 receptor, distributed widely in heart, kidney and intestine etc. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Whether SARS-CoV-2 attack heart and kidney or other vital organs directly need to be confirmed further.",
            "The most common laboratory abnormalities observed in this study were elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, hsTnI, BUN and decreased oxygen saturation etc. Compared with those survived 3 days of admission, nonsurvivors died within 3 days had numerous different findings including depressed percentages of lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD8+ cells, and elevated white blood cell count, hsTnI and BUN. These evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with cellular immune deficiency and lead to acute myocardial injury and kidney injury. These results also support the described organ injury above. In addition, the characteristic chest CT imaging of these non-survivors were evaluated by previous described method [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. The CT features demonstrated extensive infection and severe damage, regarded as \u201cwhite lung\u201d, in five lobes, but no significant difference was found between the two groups. These characteristics combined with above repented organ failure, laboratory abnormalities suggested that early organ dysfunction or failure were responsible for rapid progression of disease and death of the patients.",
            "Up to now, no antiviral treatment has been recommended for coronavirus treatment except supportive care and organ support [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. In current clinical practice, arbidol was used as an antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, but the efficacy remains to be proved. Other antiviral medications including remdesivir, lopinavir and traditional Chinese medicine are still being verified in clinical trials. Furthermore, application of intravenous immunoglobulin is recommended to enhance the ability of anti-infection for critically ill patients and steroids are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short duration of treatment as possible [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. In this study, 96.04% patients received antiviral therapy, 98.02% received antibacterial therapy. Application of glucocorticoid mainly depended on the severity of inflammatory response. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, all the non-survivors received oxygen inhalation therapy including high flow oxygen inhalation (77.23%), but quite a low proportion of patients received machine ventilation partly due to limited medical resources against the steeply increasing number of patients at early outbreak.",
            "To explore the risk factors associated with the rapid progress of disease and death, multivariable regression analysis was performed. In this study, 100 (99.01%), 53 (52.48%) and 23 (22.77%) non-survivors suffered respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury, respectively. Univariable analysis indicated elevated hsTnI, myoglobin, creatine kinase-MB, BUN, lactate and decreased oxygen saturation were associated with increased risk of death within 3 days of admission. Representative indicators associated with organs injury including hsTnI, BUN and oxygen saturation were selected and included in multivariable regression analysis. Usually, the level of neutrophils is slightly elevated or normal in virus infections, but significantly elevated neutrophils were observed in this rapid death of patients in our study. Viral infections may impair the immune system and facilitate opportunistic infection and neutrophils are crucial in protection of bacterial infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. So, neutrophil count was also included in our multivariable regression analysis. The median age of 101 died patients with COVID-19 were 71 years (IQR, 59-80) which was older compared to recent report [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. We also included age in multivariable analysis although median age of patients died within 3 days and survived 3 days of admission did not have significant difference, because older age has been reported to be associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that decreased oxygen saturation, increased neutrophil count and elevated hsTnI on admission were associated with increased odds of rapid death within 3 days of hospital admission. Early detection of these factors could help physicians to identify rapid progress of disease and death of patients with COVID-19.",
            "Several limitations existed in this study. Firstly, evaluation of CT imaging features partly depended on the experience of clinicians and radiologists which may cause inaccuracy. Secondly, in the early outbreak of COVID-19, relatively inadequate medical resources may affect the observation of the natural course of disease. Finally, only 101 patients died with COVID-19 in one hospital were included in this study, further studies including multi-centers are still needed."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "The findings of our study suggested that older patients (>70 years) with comorbidities had a steeply increased risk of death with COVID-19. Besides, respiratory failure, acute cardiac and kidney injury played a crucial role in the death of patients. Elevated high sensitivity troponin, neutrophils and depressed oxygen saturation predicted the rapid death of patients with COVID-19."
