        "abstract": "Objective The detection of communicable pathogens responsible for major outbreaks relies on health care professionals\u2019 recognition of symptoms manifesting in infectious individuals. Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. Methods We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures.",

            "Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. Our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation.<br/><br/>Keywords: SEIR model; early warning; infectious disease; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Introduction<br/><br/>The detection of communicable pathogens responsible for major outbreaks often relies on health care professionals\u2019 recognition of symptoms manifesting in infectious individuals. Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms can potentially improve both patient care and public health responses. An example of such an early warning system is the PRESAGED (Presymptomatic Agent Exposure Detection) system [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] which uses host-based physiological signals to detect an individual\u2019s exposure to pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, before overt symptoms emerge and infectiousness is peak. In animal models, the PRESAGED algorithm has been shown to provide two to three days of early warning before the onset of incipient symptoms (e.g., fever), independent of the particular pathogen, exposure route, pathogen dose, or animal species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. These results are consistent with findings of Speranza et al that show presymptomatic upregulation in biomarkers potentially linked to pathogen exposure around the same time in non-human primates exposed to Ebola [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].

We posit that a comprehensive simulation capability is essential for assessing the potential impact of a host-based early warning system.<br/><br/>We have developed a series of epidemiological models that quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. Our epidemiological models reflect a variety of traditional public health policies related to nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine and patient isolation, and novel policies enabled by host-based early warning capabilities, such as the PRESAGED system [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. For each policy-dependent model, we simulated outbreak scenarios and calculated the size of the outbreak (total number of infections) and the operational burden (total number of lost duty days resulting from quarantine or isolation). These metrics were used to understand the trade space for the different policies. Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions.<br/><br/>Models for Disease Outbreak Simulation The SEIR Model One of the most common epidemiological models for simulating disease outbreak scenarios is the deterministic SEIR model. This approach splits a given population into separate compartments defined by their relationship to a disease outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]: 1. Susceptible: healthy individuals who can be exposed to the pathogen 2. Exposed: individuals who are in the incubation phase; they have been exposed to the pathogen but are not yet showing symptoms and are not infectious 3. Infectious: individuals who are infectious to the susceptible population and will eventually display overt symptoms 4. Recovered: those who have recovered from illness and acquired immunity to further infection<br/><br/>These compartments are then linked with a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to characterize how individuals transition into and out of each compartment over time. A variety of scenarios can be simulated by changing the rate parameters of the ODEs linking the population compartments. Furthermore, this approach allows quantitative projections of how many people are exposed to a pathogen and become sick under different outbreak conditions. While the SEIR model is mathematically rigorous and often has good predictive utility during an outbreak, the SEIR model requires several assumptions. First, the model assumes there is a fixed population N, with no births or deaths other than those resulting from the infectious disease. Second, it assumes the population is homogeneously mixing, that is the transmission between any two individuals is equally likely. Third, the model assumes that exposed individuals become infectious after a fixed incubation period, thus not accounting for individual variability of disease progression for the young, elderly, or immunocompromised. Finally, the model assumes that all recovered individuals are immune to further infection and thus do not re-enter the susceptible class. While any of these assumptions may fail to hold in particular contexts, abiding by them allows for greater mathematical tractability and offers similar relative output trends. Baseline SEIR Model The SEIR model consists of a system of four ODEs that describe the rate of change of individuals in each compartment over time (Figure 1). The differential equations for Susceptible,  #, Exposed,  #, Infectious,  #, and Recovered,  # are as follows, where dependence on time,  , is omitted in the notation below for simplicity:    = \u2212    =    Parameter N    E0 \u03b2<br/><br/>Definition Total active population (S + E + I + R) Initially exposed population Contact rate<br/><br/>Parameter Values (used in analysis) 1000    \u03c3    Incubation rate<br/><br/>0.5 (2-day incubation period) \u03b3    Infectious rate<br/><br/>0.2 (5-day infectious period) \u03c1    Recovery rate    0.18 f<br/><br/>Case fatality rate    0.1 \u03b8<br/><br/>Self-reporting probability<br/><br/>1 (all ill individuals self-report) \u03b1<br/><br/>Self-reporting rate<br/><br/>0.5 (2-day self-report delay) t<br/><br/>Time of quarantine    Q \u03b5    Release rate<br/><br/>0.2 (5-day quarantine period) \u03ba    False-alarm rate<br/><br/>1/365 (1 false alarm per year) \u03bb<br/><br/>Early detection rate<br/><br/>1 (1-day early detection time)    PD<br/><br/>Probability of early detection (a)    (b)<br/><br/>Policy-Dependent SEIR Models In the previous section, we considered the standard SEIR model, which describes disease spread without any public health interventions. To quantitatively evaluate an outbreak scenario with additional measures, the parameters and compartments of the SEIR model can be modified to reflect policy choices or new early warning technologies. Two policies currently considered as standards in handling possible outbreaks rely on self-monitoring to implement voluntary isolation or quarantining all individuals that may have been exposed to a pathogen. Isolation applies to individuals who are already ill, whereas quarantine applies to individuals who may have been exposed but have not yet shown symptoms. The first policy, self-monitoring and reporting, which assumes individuals self-report when they develop symptoms, allows for additional infections during the time delay between the onset of symptoms and isolation; however, it does not account for the logistical and financial cost of quarantine. The second policy, quarantining the entire population, is effective in reducing additional transmissions but has a prohibitively onerous costs for large populations. In an effort to explore the impact of a host-based early warning system, we modified the SEIR model to simulate a third policy, quarantine-on-alert, in which individuals are only quarantined when prompted by a host-based early warning system. We hypothesized that the early notification of incipient illness will allow for reductions in pathogen transmission while minimizing the number of quarantined individuals. We then assessed each of these three new policy-dependent SEIR models. Self-Monitoring and Reporting: Isolation after Symptoms In the course of an infectious disease outbreak, most individuals tend to self-monitor for symptoms of the pathogen. If individuals start to develop symptoms, they can self-report to a medical facility and may be immediately isolated until they recover. A new compartment, isoLated (L), was added to the SEIR model to reflect this symptomatic and infectious population, which has limited contact with the rest of the population and therefore reduced transmission potential (Figure 3). The self-reporting probability \u03b8 is defined as the proportion of symptomatic individuals who are compliant in reporting their symptoms and enter the L compartment. The self-reporting rate \u03b1 is derived from the delay between developing symptoms and self-reporting (i.e., the inverse of the average time delay). For our model, we assumed that isolation is 100 percent effective in preventing transmission, and individuals in the L compartment are unable to infect the susceptible population. While a self-monitoring policy reduces transmission rates by isolating the self-reported sick, both the latency \u03b1 and an imperfect self-reporting probability (\u03b8<1) can lead to opportunities for transmission.<br/><br/>Outputs for the SEIR model with self-reporting and isolation are shown in Figure 4. This policy addition leads to both fewer total individuals contracting the disease and fewer individuals acutely symptomatic at the height of the outbreak. The new isolated compartment L, however, has other costs associated with lost duty days, mandated isolation, medical facilities, and treatment. The choices of self-reporting probability and rate are critical in this scenario, and, in reality, may have such broad distributions that relying on this policy in an acute outbreak may do little to prevent additional infections.<br/><br/>Quarantining the Entire Population Another possible public health response to an outbreak is to quarantine currently healthy individuals with some likelihood of pathogen exposure. In outbreaks where a large population subset has some exposure likelihood, a quarantine-all policy would separate all individuals in the population from contact with one another. Our model assumes that quarantined individuals, represented by the Q compartment, are monitored and immediately isolated once they develop symptoms (Figure 5). If quarantined individuals do not become symptomatic after the maximum incubation time of the suspected pathogen (often several weeks), they are released and re-enter the S compartment at a rate of \u03b5 (the inverse of the maximum incubation time). As shown in Figure 6, the quarantine-all policy eliminates opportunities for further pathogen transmission; however, it also results in the quarantine of healthy individuals who have not been exposed, contributing to immense productivity losses, extreme logistic burdens associated with providing accommodations for an entire population, and acute civil rights concerns. Furthermore, the assumption that transmission is zero within the Q compartment may not be realistic because transmission for some pathogen may occur before overt symptoms and isolation. This quarantine-all policy could result in the illness of people who, if not for the quarantine, would never have been exposed to the pathogen.<br/><br/>Quarantine on Alert The third model we explored simulates a novel policy that could potentially be enabled by future host-based early detection capabilities. Here, a host-based early warning system could prompt a quarantine only on alert when the system detects pre-symptomatic signs of exposure. We integrated the early warning performance metrics from our PRESAGED algorithm\u2014populationwide probability of early detection, daily false-alarm rate, and early detection time\u2014into a base SEIR model. As shown in Figure 7, a host-based early warning system would trigger exposed individuals to transition into quarantine at a rate characterized by the product of the parameters \u03bb and PD. The parameter \u03bb is an early detection rate defined as the inverse of the system\u2019s average early detection time for a given pathogen. The parameter PD is the population-wide probability of early detection, i.e., the fraction of the exposed population that will present early detections of pathogen exposure prior to becoming infectious. Missed detection cases, when the system fails to produce an early warning, occur with a probability of 1 \u2013 PD across the exposed population. For this policy, false alarms of the host-based early warning system would cause healthy individuals to be incorrectly quarantined. Our model takes this notion into account by adding a transition rate from the susceptible to the quarantined compartment, characterized by a daily false-alarm rate \u03ba, the probability of an individual\u2019s early warning system presenting a false alarm on a given day.<br/><br/>cumulative infections versus time in (b). The quarantine-on-alert policy has effectively reduced the additional disease cases and has largely limited those in quarantine to those individuals who were initially exposed.<br/><br/>While the self-monitoring and quarantine-all policies present clear trade-offs between cumulative number of infections and number of people isolated or quarantined, this quarantine-on-alert policy offers a hybrid approach that could optimize for both. Quarantine-on-alert vastly reduces quarantine costs by selectively identifying likely exposed individuals through physiologically based predictions. Furthermore, once quarantined, these high-risk individuals can be immediately isolated, thus limiting the opportunities of additional infections and enabling more focused medical care.<br/><br/>SEIR Model Reproduction Numbers by Policy Choice<br/><br/>Modifications made to the baseline SEIR model result in changes to the reproduction number (R) associated with each policy-dependent SEIR model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Our example scenario assumes that every symptomatic person will self-report and thus the self-reporting probability, \u03b8, is 1. Table 2 summarizes equations to calculate R values for each policy, the R values given the parameter values in Table 1, and the cumulative cases of infection for each policy choice after 50 days. The policies with the lower R values (quarantine-all and quarantine-on-alert) are associated with minimal pathogen spread, while the policies with higher R values (self-monitoring and baseline) yield a greater number of infection cases. The number of cumulative infections as the ODE reaches equilibrium illustrates how the reproduction number would affect the final size of the outbreak. Note that the number of cumulative infections for baseline saturates around the population size (N = 1000) when the number of individuals in the susceptible compartment is exhausted.

The nominal   Value and Cumulative Infections were calculated using parameter values from    Table 1.<br/><br/>Policy Trade-Space Analysis<br/><br/>The policy-dependent SEIR models provide a foundation for a trade-space analysis of different quarantine, isolation, and treatment (QIT) policies as a function of disease transmission characteristics, exposure scenarios, and performance of early warning systems. The analysis captures both the potential benefits (reduction in quarantine costs, more focused use of medical resources) and risks (increase in infections) for each policy.<br/><br/>To demonstrate the potential utility of the early warning\u2013enabled quarantine-on-alert model in a more comprehensive QIT policy analysis, we compared outcomes over a range of disease transmission rates, initial exposure conditions, and early warning performance parameters. We varied these parameters in simulations of a mass exposure to an infectious pathogen occurring in a population of 1,000 people. All scenarios were simulated over 50 days. Because we fixed the exposure time for all cases to t = 0, rather than using the quarantine release rate \u03b5, all individuals in quarantine were returned to the susceptible compartment at t = 21 days (the maximum incubation period).<br/><br/>We defined policy outcomes via two metrics derived from the policy-dependent SEIR model outputs as shown in Figure 9. The first, lost duty days, is the percentage of total number of days of work productivity that are lost because of quarantine and isolation in the 50-day simulation; this percentage is proportional to the integral of the curves in Figure 9a. The second metric, cumulative infections, is the percentage of the population that has been infected by the end of the simulation (Figure 9b). These two metrics characterize a trade space for evaluating QIT policies under different circumstances, as any measure that reduces the number of people in quarantine and isolation may be expected to increase the likelihood of infection in the population. While these metrics are helpful for evaluating the impact of various policy choices, they are by no means comprehensive and particularly do not consider the financial or other costs associated with quarantine.    QIT Policies<br/><br/>Outbreak Scenarios Scenariosolicies<br/><br/>Using these metrics, we evaluated five QIT policy sets: quarantine-all, isolate upon selfreporting, and quarantine-on-alert with three different levels of early detection performance\u2014 high sensitivity (PD = 0.8, \u03ba =0.10), high specificity (PD = 0.4, \u03ba = 1/365), and a near-ideal earlydetection system (PD = 0.8, \u03ba = 1/365). These five QIT policy options were then tested against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission (where \u03b2 = 0.6 or 0.3, respectively) and high or low initial population exposures (where E0 = 600 or 50, respectively). Figure 10 shows the QIT policy trade-offs for these 20 independent outbreak and policy combinations.<br/><br/>We found that for all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduced quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of focusing on a high-specificity early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) was an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a high-sensitivity system increased the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the number seen by quarantining the entire population a priori.<br/><br/>For scenarios with low initial exposure, the impact of early warning\u2013enabled QIT policies varied dramatically with transmissibility. For low-transmissibility and small initial exposures (Figure 11a), an early warning capability demonstrated the least utility as the outbreak was effectively contained with just self-monitoring. However, for a pathogen with high transmissibility (Figure 11b), the cumulative infections were reduced significantly with the notional early warning systems. A high-specificity system offered a particularly promising result, showing comparable infection reduction to the near-ideal system while also minimizing the number of days lost to quarantine.<br/><br/>In the scenarios of high initial exposure (Figure 11c and Figure 11d), the costs of imperfect early detection were more pronounced compared to those for scenarios of low initial exposure. Because a high initial exposure greatly increased the likelihood of infectious individuals transmitting the pathogen to those susceptible, even a short delay in isolating infectious individuals lead to more infections. The reduction of cumulative infections for all notional early warning systems, relative to the self-monitoring policy, was less prominent than in scenarios of low initial exposure as the initial exposed population was close to saturation. In effect, for these extreme cases of mass exposures, the more aggressive policies (i.e., a high-sensitivity early detection system or quarantining everyone) may be more effective."

            "<strong>Discussion and Future</strong><br/><br/>Work Our results on the early warning\u2013enabled and policy-dependent SEIR models allows for a quantitative analysis of the QIT trade space and provides potential guidance on priorities for the future development of early warning technology. However, this illustration of QIT risk analysis captures only a subset of the factors that must be considered in the formulation of a rational, effective QIT policy. The context of the scenario will ultimately inform where the ideal operating point would be. For example, the number of total infections may be interpreted differently depending upon the virulence of the disease. The tolerance for new infections may be low if the consequences are high, such as if the infection is almost always fatal or is associated with severe symptoms and long-term complications. Additionally, the availability of diagnostic tests may further refine the use of early warning capabilities; a more sensitive early detection capability could be combined with a cued use of diagnostic testing to form a much more targeted approach, reducing costs and the likelihood of a false detection. While the results we presented are a first attempt at understanding the potential utility of a host-based early warning system during an outbreak, a comprehensive risk assessment of a QIT policy must consider a range of factors: \u2022 Disease characteristics: prevalence, transmissibility, incubation period, and severity \u2022 Response options: reliable diagnostic tests, vaccines, or treatments \u2022 Resources: cost and availability of QIT measures \u2022 Early warning capability: performance characteristics of early warning systems \u2022 Public health infrastructure: ability to implement an effective public health campaign<br/><br/>An element that we do not include in our model is patient care measures, which are nearly always more effective when deployed earlier than overt indications of infection (e.g., fever). For instance, antiviral drugs (such as zanamivir and oseltamivir/Tamiflu) are most effective in the first ~48 hours of symptoms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]; PRESAGED-enabled early warning would allow much faster prescription, use, and potentially more profound therapeutic impact for current dosage recommendations. Triggering the use of diagnostics early would allow clinicians to target drugbased interventions, such as using the precise antibiotic for bacterial infections rather than relying on broad-spectrum versions that contribute to the evolution of drug-resistant bacteria (\u201csuperbugs\u201d). Finally, simple supportive care for mild infections, e.g., having rehydrating solutions or over-the-counter symptom-relieving medications available, could ease the burden on health care workers in hospitals, nursing homes, or college campuses. All of these exciting possibilities could be enabled or improved with earlier detection.<br/><br/>Future modeling efforts need to focus on improvements to this model, especially as more is known about the mechanistic basis for host-based early warning of pathogen exposure. Several enhancements of QIT policy include: 1. Consequences of infection, or a cost function of being in the infectious compartment.<br/><br/>Adding a more explicit fatality compartment is straightforward. However, more complex models incorporating significantly time-delayed or nonlinear costs are much more accurate for measuring the effectiveness of QIT policies.<br/><br/>2. Early quarantine release. When the maximum incubation period may result in long quarantine periods that lead to unacceptably high quarantine costs, the absence of an exposure detection in individuals who have not been exposed to the pathogen may trigger an early release from quarantine. This early quarantine release approach could significantly reduce costs and civil rights issues associated with quarantine.<br/><br/>3. Modeling of additional QIT responses. Incorporating diagnostic tests into the models could refine the quarantine trigger and release policies. Additionally, future models could include specific treatments upon early warning to modulate infection outcomes. Such options may be particularly important in circumstances when quarantine and isolation resources are limited.<br/><br/>4. Movement among populations. The policy-dependent SEIR model addresses a single, isolated population being homogenously mixed. However, in many circumstances, QIT policy is driven by a concern for the spread of the pathogen into connected populations. To address these circumstances, the policy-dependent SEIR model may be further extended to incorporate changes in each population compartment that result from the movement of people into (or out of) individual population compartments from (or to) other populations. In this formulation, individual populations are modeled with the extended SEIR mode as nodes in a migration network. Network edges are characterized by migration rates between the connected subpopulations.<br/><br/>5. Stochastic modeling. In a more realistic model, each of the SEIR parameters may be modeled in greater detail as a probability distribution rather than a fixed value. Stochastic modeling would support a more comprehensive risk analysis that includes insights about the likely range of potential outcomes, as well as rare but high consequence \u201cedge\u201d cases. In conclusion, we have shown the epidemiological value of host-based early warning systems in a variety of pathogen outbreaks. By adjusting the underlying assumption, both of the outbreak and the system performance metrics of a notional early detection system, we show in which scenarios early detection is most impactful. The results of this work emphasize the value of early detection in modulating public health responses, though future efforts will also include the value to individual patients."

To quantitatively evaluate an outbreak scenario with additional measures, the parameters and compartments of the SEIR model can be modified to reflect policy choices or new early warning technologies. Two policies currently considered as standards in handling possible outbreaks rely on self-monitoring to implement voluntary isolation or quarantining all individuals that may have been exposed to a pathogen. Isolation applies to individuals who are already ill, whereas quarantine applies to individuals who may have been exposed but have not yet shown symptoms. The first policy, self-monitoring and reporting, which assumes individuals self-report when they develop symptoms, allows for additional infections during the time delay between the onset of symptoms and isolation; however, it does not account for the logistical and financial cost of quarantine. The second policy, quarantining the entire population, is effective in reducing additional transmissions but has a prohibitively onerous costs for large populations. In an effort to explore the impact of a host-based early warning system, we modified the SEIR model to simulate a third policy, quarantine-on-alert, in which individuals are only quarantined when prompted by a host-based early warning system. We hypothesized that the early notification of incipient illness will allow for reductions in pathogen transmission while minimizing the number of quarantined individuals. We then assessed each of these three new policy-dependent SEIR models. Self-Monitoring and Reporting: Isolation after Symptoms In the course of an infectious disease outbreak, most individuals tend to self-monitor for symptoms of the pathogen. If individuals start to develop symptoms, they can self-report to a medical facility and may be immediately isolated until they recover. A new compartment, isoLated (L), was added to the SEIR model to reflect this symptomatic and infectious population, which has limited contact with the rest of the population and therefore reduced transmission potential (Figure 3). The self-reporting probability \u03b8 is defined as the proportion of symptomatic individuals who are compliant in reporting their symptoms and enter the L compartment. The self-reporting rate \u03b1 is derived from the delay between developing symptoms and self-reporting (i.e., the inverse of the average time delay). For our model, we assumed that isolation is 100 percent effective in preventing transmission, and individuals in the L compartment are unable to infect the susceptible population. While a self-monitoring policy reduces transmission rates by isolating the self-reported sick, both the latency \u03b1 and an imperfect self-reporting probability (\u03b8<1) can lead to opportunities for transmission.",
            "Outputs for the SEIR model with self-reporting and isolation are shown in Figure 4. This policy addition leads to both fewer total individuals contracting the disease and fewer individuals acutely symptomatic at the height of the outbreak. The new isolated compartment L, however, has other costs associated with lost duty days, mandated isolation, medical facilities, and treatment. The choices of self-reporting probability and rate are critical in this scenario, and, in reality, may have such broad distributions that relying on this policy in an acute outbreak may do little to prevent additional infections.",
            "Quarantining the Entire Population Another possible public health response to an outbreak is to quarantine currently healthy individuals with some likelihood of pathogen exposure. In outbreaks where a large population subset has some exposure likelihood, a quarantine-all policy would separate all individuals in the population from contact with one another. Our model assumes that quarantined individuals, represented by the Q compartment, are monitored and immediately isolated once they develop symptoms (Figure 5). If quarantined individuals do not become symptomatic after the maximum incubation time of the suspected pathogen (often several weeks), they are released and re-enter the S compartment at a rate of \u03b5 (the inverse of the maximum incubation time). As shown in Figure 6, the quarantine-all policy eliminates opportunities for further pathogen transmission; however, it also results in the quarantine of healthy individuals who have not been exposed, contributing to immense productivity losses, extreme logistic burdens associated with providing accommodations for an entire population, and acute civil rights concerns. Furthermore, the assumption that transmission is zero within the Q compartment may not be realistic because transmission for some pathogen may occur before overt symptoms and isolation. This quarantine-all policy could result in the illness of people who, if not for the quarantine, would never have been exposed to the pathogen.",
            "Quarantine on Alert The third model we explored simulates a novel policy that could potentially be enabled by future host-based early detection capabilities. Here, a host-based early warning system could prompt a quarantine only on alert when the system detects pre-symptomatic signs of exposure. We integrated the early warning performance metrics from our PRESAGED algorithm\u2014populationwide probability of early detection, daily false-alarm rate, and early detection time\u2014into a base SEIR model. As shown in Figure 7, a host-based early warning system would trigger exposed individuals to transition into quarantine at a rate characterized by the product of the parameters \u03bb and PD. The parameter \u03bb is an early detection rate defined as the inverse of the system\u2019s average early detection time for a given pathogen. The parameter PD is the population-wide probability of early detection, i.e., the fraction of the exposed population that will present early detections of pathogen exposure prior to becoming infectious. Missed detection cases, when the system fails to produce an early warning, occur with a probability of 1 \u2013 PD across the exposed population. For this policy, false alarms of the host-based early warning system would cause healthy individuals to be incorrectly quarantined. Our model takes this notion into account by adding a transition rate from the susceptible to the quarantined compartment, characterized by a daily false-alarm rate \u03ba, the probability of an individual\u2019s early warning system presenting a false alarm on a given day.",
            "While the self-monitoring and quarantine-all policies present clear trade-offs between cumulative number of infections and number of people isolated or quarantined, this quarantine-on-alert policy offers a hybrid approach that could optimize for both. Quarantine-on-alert vastly reduces quarantine costs by selectively identifying likely exposed individuals through physiologically based predictions. Furthermore, once quarantined, these high-risk individuals can be immediately isolated, thus limiting the opportunities of additional infections and enabling more focused medical care.",
            "Modifications made to the baseline SEIR model result in changes to the reproduction number (R) associated with each policy-dependent SEIR model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Our example scenario assumes that every symptomatic person will self-report and thus the self-reporting probability, \u03b8, is 1. Table 2 summarizes equations to calculate R values for each policy, the R values given the parameter values in Table 1, and the cumulative cases of infection for each policy choice after 50 days. The policies with the lower R values (quarantine-all and quarantine-on-alert) are associated with minimal pathogen spread, while the policies with higher R values (self-monitoring and baseline) yield a greater number of infection cases. The number of cumulative infections as the ODE reaches equilibrium illustrates how the reproduction number would affect the final size of the outbreak. Note that the number of cumulative infections for baseline saturates around the population size (N = 1000) when the number of individuals in the susceptible compartment is exhausted.",
            "In a population of N = 1000, the number of initially exposed individuals is E0 = 300. The nominal   Value and Cumulative Infections were calculated using parameter values from",
            "Table 1.",
            "The policy-dependent SEIR models provide a foundation for a trade-space analysis of different quarantine, isolation, and treatment (QIT) policies as a function of disease transmission characteristics, exposure scenarios, and performance of early warning systems. The analysis captures both the potential benefits (reduction in quarantine costs, more focused use of medical resources) and risks (increase in infections) for each policy.",
            "To demonstrate the potential utility of the early warning\u2013enabled quarantine-on-alert model in a more comprehensive QIT policy analysis, we compared outcomes over a range of disease transmission rates, initial exposure conditions, and early warning performance parameters. We varied these parameters in simulations of a mass exposure to an infectious pathogen occurring in a population of 1,000 people. All scenarios were simulated over 50 days. Because we fixed the exposure time for all cases to t = 0, rather than using the quarantine release rate \u03b5, all individuals in quarantine were returned to the susceptible compartment at t = 21 days (the maximum incubation period).",
            "We defined policy outcomes via two metrics derived from the policy-dependent SEIR model outputs as shown in Figure 9. The first, lost duty days, is the percentage of total number of days of work productivity that are lost because of quarantine and isolation in the 50-day simulation; this percentage is proportional to the integral of the curves in Figure 9a. The second metric, cumulative infections, is the percentage of the population that has been infected by the end of the simulation (Figure 9b). These two metrics characterize a trade space for evaluating QIT policies under different circumstances, as any measure that reduces the number of people in quarantine and isolation may be expected to increase the likelihood of infection in the population. While these metrics are helpful for evaluating the impact of various policy choices, they are by no means comprehensive and particularly do not consider the financial or other costs associated with quarantine.",
            "Using these metrics, we evaluated five QIT policy sets: quarantine-all, isolate upon selfreporting, and quarantine-on-alert with three different levels of early detection performance\u2014 high sensitivity (PD = 0.8, \u03ba =0.10), high specificity (PD = 0.4, \u03ba = 1/365), and a near-ideal earlydetection system (PD = 0.8, \u03ba = 1/365). These five QIT policy options were then tested against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission (where \u03b2 = 0.6 or 0.3, respectively) and high or low initial population exposures (where E0 = 600 or 50, respectively). Figure 10 shows the QIT policy trade-offs for these 20 independent outbreak and policy combinations.",
            "We found that for all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduced quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of focusing on a high-specificity early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) was an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a high-sensitivity system increased the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the number seen by quarantining the entire population a priori.",
            "For scenarios with low initial exposure, the impact of early warning\u2013enabled QIT policies varied dramatically with transmissibility. For low-transmissibility and small initial exposures (Figure 11a), an early warning capability demonstrated the least utility as the outbreak was effectively contained with just self-monitoring. However, for a pathogen with high transmissibility (Figure 11b), the cumulative infections were reduced significantly with the notional early warning systems. A high-specificity system offered a particularly promising result, showing comparable infection reduction to the near-ideal system while also minimizing the number of days lost to quarantine.",
            "In the scenarios of high initial exposure (Figure 11c and Figure 11d), the costs of imperfect early detection were more pronounced compared to those for scenarios of low initial exposure. Because a high initial exposure greatly increased the likelihood of infectious individuals transmitting the pathogen to those susceptible, even a short delay in isolating infectious individuals lead to more infections. The reduction of cumulative infections for all notional early warning systems, relative to the self-monitoring policy, was less prominent than in scenarios of low initial exposure as the initial exposed population was close to saturation. In effect, for these extreme cases of mass exposures, the more aggressive policies (i.e., a high-sensitivity early detection system or quarantining everyone) may be more effective."

        "Discussion and Future": [
            "Work Our results on the early warning\u2013enabled and policy-dependent SEIR models allows for a quantitative analysis of the QIT trade space and provides potential guidance on priorities for the future development of early warning technology. However, this illustration of QIT risk analysis captures only a subset of the factors that must be considered in the formulation of a rational, effective QIT policy. The context of the scenario will ultimately inform where the ideal operating point would be. For example, the number of total infections may be interpreted differently depending upon the virulence of the disease. The tolerance for new infections may be low if the consequences are high, such as if the infection is almost always fatal or is associated with severe symptoms and long-term complications. Additionally, the availability of diagnostic tests may further refine the use of early warning capabilities; a more sensitive early detection capability could be combined with a cued use of diagnostic testing to form a much more targeted approach, reducing costs and the likelihood of a false detection. While the results we presented are a first attempt at understanding the potential utility of a host-based early warning system during an outbreak, a comprehensive risk assessment of a QIT policy must consider a range of factors: \u2022 Disease characteristics: prevalence, transmissibility, incubation period, and severity \u2022 Response options: reliable diagnostic tests, vaccines, or treatments \u2022 Resources: cost and availability of QIT measures \u2022 Early warning capability: performance characteristics of early warning systems \u2022 Public health infrastructure: ability to implement an effective public health campaign",
            "An element that we do not include in our model is patient care measures, which are nearly always more effective when deployed earlier than overt indications of infection (e.g., fever). For instance, antiviral drugs (such as zanamivir and oseltamivir/Tamiflu) are most effective in the first ~48 hours of symptoms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]; PRESAGED-enabled early warning would allow much faster prescription, use, and potentially more profound therapeutic impact for current dosage recommendations. Triggering the use of diagnostics early would allow clinicians to target drugbased interventions, such as using the precise antibiotic for bacterial infections rather than relying on broad-spectrum versions that contribute to the evolution of drug-resistant bacteria (\u201csuperbugs\u201d). Finally, simple supportive care for mild infections, e.g., having rehydrating solutions or over-the-counter symptom-relieving medications available, could ease the burden on health care workers in hospitals, nursing homes, or college campuses. All of these exciting possibilities could be enabled or improved with earlier detection.",
            "Future modeling efforts need to focus on improvements to this model, especially as more is known about the mechanistic basis for host-based early warning of pathogen exposure. Several enhancements of QIT policy include: 1. Consequences of infection, or a cost function of being in the infectious compartment.",
            "Adding a more explicit fatality compartment is straightforward. However, more complex models incorporating significantly time-delayed or nonlinear costs are much more accurate for measuring the effectiveness of QIT policies.",
            "2. Early quarantine release. When the maximum incubation period may result in long quarantine periods that lead to unacceptably high quarantine costs, the absence of an exposure detection in individuals who have not been exposed to the pathogen may trigger an early release from quarantine. This early quarantine release approach could significantly reduce costs and civil rights issues associated with quarantine.",
            "3. Modeling of additional QIT responses. Incorporating diagnostic tests into the models could refine the quarantine trigger and release policies. Additionally, future models could include specific treatments upon early warning to modulate infection outcomes. Such options may be particularly important in circumstances when quarantine and isolation resources are limited.",
            "4. Movement among populations. The policy-dependent SEIR model addresses a single, isolated population being homogenously mixed. However, in many circumstances, QIT policy is driven by a concern for the spread of the pathogen into connected populations. To address these circumstances, the policy-dependent SEIR model may be further extended to incorporate changes in each population compartment that result from the movement of people into (or out of) individual population compartments from (or to) other populations. In this formulation, individual populations are modeled with the extended SEIR mode as nodes in a migration network. Network edges are characterized by migration rates between the connected subpopulations.",
            "5. Stochastic modeling. In a more realistic model, each of the SEIR parameters may be modeled in greater detail as a probability distribution rather than a fixed value. Stochastic modeling would support a more comprehensive risk analysis that includes insights about the likely range of potential outcomes, as well as rare but high consequence \u201cedge\u201d cases. In conclusion, we have shown the epidemiological value of host-based early warning systems in a variety of pathogen outbreaks. By adjusting the underlying assumption, both of the outbreak and the system performance metrics of a notional early detection system, we show in which scenarios early detection is most impactful. The results of this work emphasize the value of early detection in modulating public health responses, though future efforts will also include the value to individual patients.",

        "A high-sensitivity system increased the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the number seen by quarantining the entire population a priori",
        "For low-transmissibility and small initial exposures (Figure 11a), an early warning capability demonstrated the least utility as the outbreak was effectively contained with just self-monitoring",
        "The reduction of cumulative infections for all notional early warning systems, relative to the self-monitoring policy, was less prominent than in scenarios of low initial exposure as the initial exposed population was close to saturation",
        "The availability of diagnostic tests may further refine the use of early warning capabilities; a more sensitive early detection capability could be combined with a cued use of diagnostic testing to form a much more targeted approach, reducing costs and the likelihood of a false detection",
        "The policy-dependent SEIR model may be further extended to incorporate changes in each population compartment that result from the movement of people into individual population compartments from other populations"
