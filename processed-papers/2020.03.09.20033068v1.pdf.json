            "In December 2019, viral pneumonia outbreaks caused by coronavirus occurred in<br/><br/>Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly worldwide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. The illness progress of partial patient is rapid and the mortality rate is 3.4%. By 5th March, 2020, the cumulative number of infections wordwild was 95,333, of which 3,282 died[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. In 30th January, 2020, the World<br/><br/>Health Organization issued a global warning about the highly contagious virus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], which was named as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 11th February[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Current studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] demonstrate the laboratory and clinical features that COVID-19 often occurs in elderly men with basic diseases. In early stage, fever and dry cough with reduced lymphocytes are the major symptoms, which develop into fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure in the late stage.<br/><br/>However, there are few studies on the clinical characteristics of death cases due to the small sample size. To understand the clinical characteristics, a retrospective analysis of clinical features in 101 death cases in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital is carried out."

            "2.1. Study Population<br/><br/>This study collected Death Cases with COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020 in Intensive care unit(ICU) of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital is an infectious disease hospital, which is prescribed by Chinese government as one of the first designated treatment units for patients with the disease. The diagnosis of confirmed cases and clinical cases is in line with Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial version 5)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. The confirmed cases are those who have pathogenic evidence, positive RT-PCR or highly homologous gene sequencing with known coronavirus. The clinical cases are those who have epidemic history, or who have no definite epidemic history but have clinical symptoms and imaging characteristics. Epidemic history includes that within 14 days somebody has travelling history in Wuhan and surrounding areas, been exposed to other infections, communicated with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or from case-reporting communities, or clustering onset. The clinical symptoms include fever or respiratory symptoms, and decreased lymphocyte with normal or decrease leukocyte in the early stage.<br/><br/>This study is approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital Approval, and all relevant personnel exempt from informed consent due to the particularity of the disease outbreak.<br/><br/>2.2. Data Collection<br/><br/>The retrospective analysis is based on the case reports, nursing records, test results, and imaging results. Data include demographics, basic diseases, X-ray/CT results, possible therapy strategies and test results when their entrance into admission, ICU and 48 h before death. The therapy strategy represents antiviral treatment, antibacterial treatment, corticosteroid treatment, immunotherapy, and respiratory therapy. The onset time is defined as the day symptom appears. Records begins from onset to admission, admission to ICU, ICU periods, and onset to death.<br/><br/>2.3. Statistical Analysis<br/><br/>We compared the differences in epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory measures between patients who had died due to infection by COVID-19 at onset to admission, admission to ICU and 48h before death.We present continuous measurements as mean (SD) if they are normally distributed or median (IQR) if they are not, and categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages(%). For laboratory results, we also assessed whether the measurements were outside the normal range. We used SPSS (version 24.0) for all analyses."

            "3.1. Demographics<br/><br/>By Feb 16, 2020, this study involved 101 COVID-19 dead cases in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, of which 57 (56.44%) patients were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%) patients were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria. In the death cases, 47 patients went directly to the ICU because of critical condition, and 54 patients were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition. All cases died in the end. Among them, 1 patients died with the symptom of acute coronary artery, while the rest of them died with the symptom of respiratory failure and multiple organ failure caused by COVID-19. The cases included 64 males and 37 females with the age range of 24-83 and average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The majority had basic diseases with hypertension 42.57%, diabetes 22.77%, neurological disease 9.90%, malignant tumor 4.95%, and respiratory disease 4.95%. Cases combined with more than two basic diseases reached 25.74%. In detail, 10 patients had contact history with South China Seafood Market, and 10 patients had close contact history with infections. The blood type distribution was significantly different, with type A 44.44%, type B 29.29%, type AB 8.08% and type O 18.19%. The median time from onset to hospital was 11.00 days ( ) IQR8.00-13.50 . The median time from onset to death was 21.00 days ( ) IQR17.00-27.5 (Table 1) .<br/><br/>3.2. Clinical Features<br/><br/>The relative frequencies of all reported symptoms at the time of admission are shown in Table 2. The most common symptom was fever (91 [90.10%] of 101 patients), but most patients dropped to normal temperature after admission 1-3 days, which may be related to hormone use. Cough (69 [68.32%]) and dyspnea (75 [74.26%]) were also common symptoms. 31(30.69%) patients had sputum symptoms in the early stage with white sputum, and 3 patients showed yellowish purulent sputum. 50(49.50%) patients showed Acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) at the time of admission, and the median time from onset to ARDS was 12 days(IQR9.00-14.00).Other common symptoms included myalgia, general weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, among which 86(85.15%) patients had more than two symptoms.21(20.79%) patients had no respiratory symptoms, and 7(6.93%) patients initially appeared gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Distinctive from SARS, only 2 patients with COVID-19 had diarrhea."

        "findings": [
            "Most of patients (99 [98.02%] of 101 patients) had abnormal lung imaging at the time of initial admission, 6(5.94%) patients had single-lung disease, and 93(92.08%) patients had double-lung disease. The disease initially showed scattered plaque-like ground glass in the lung. Dynamic imaging showed progressive multi-spot patchy shadows in both lungs. Pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 3 (2.97%) patients.",
            "Blood routine, biochemical reports and inflammation of cases when their entrance into admission, ICU and 48h before death were collected. Most patients showed increased leukocytes,neutrophils, and decreased lymphocytes at time of consultation.Their inflammatory indicators such as neutrophils, Procalcitonin(PCT),C-reactive protein(CRP), and Interleukin-6(IL-6) gradually increased as time went on. It was found that patient's platelets(PLT) decreased, D-dimer and Prothrombin time(PT) increased correspondingly during disease progression via dynamic analysis of coagulation-related indicators. Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission(83 [82.18%] of 101 patients). With the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased. It also indicated that there was a high proportion of myocardial damage in the early stage. This study also found that liver and kidney damage were not significant at the time of admission and when transferred to ICU, and it significantly turned worse 48h before death. Experiment data can be seen in Table 3-5.    3.5. Treatment<br/><br/>For all patients, 97 patients were transferred to Jinyintan Hospital due to laboratory diagnosis or exacerbation after treatment in other hospitals. All patients were treated in isolation. Among them, 61(60.40%) used antiviral drugs, including Oseltamivir, Ribavirin, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Ganciclovir, Interferon, etc. 59(58.42%) patients used glucocorticoids, 64(63.37%) patients used intravenous immunoglobulins, and 45(44.55%) patients used thymosin preparations. All patients received antibiotic treatment, including cephalosporins and quinolones, etc.,More than half of patients used restricted antibiotics(63 [62.38%] of 101 patients), including carbapenems, linezolid, tigecycline, etc., due to repeated rise in body temperature or wave in inflammation indicators. 23(22.78%) patients used antifungal drugs.<br/><br/>All patients received oxygen therapy. 84(83.17%) used non-invasive ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy equipment, and 77(76.24%) used invasive mechanical ventilation. The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00 days(IQR0.00-6.00), of which 21 patients were intubated 2 days before death. The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 1\u201331 days (median 5 days [IQR2.00-8.00]). 7 patients were treated with ECMO and 8 patients were treated with CRRT."

            "Our study reported the clinical characteristics of 101 deaths from COVID-19. As far as we know, this is the largest sample among the research reports on the clinical characteristics of dead patients. Although previous studies included some deaths, the number of cases were less.<br/><br/>Up to 5th March, 2020, the cumulative number of infected people wordwild was 95,333, and the number of death was 3,282. The mortality rate was as high as 3.4%, which is much higher than that of general pneumonia. Among the 101 deaths, male is significantly higher than female, and the proportion of elderly patients with basic diseases is relatively high. The average age of death patients in this study was significantly higher than previous studies. In the study, we found the blood group composition of death patients (A-42.57%, B-30.69%, O-17.82%, AB-8.91%) was different from that of Han population in Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Type O was relatively low, and Type A was relatively high. The mechanism which caused this is still unclear. ABO blood group antigen substances are widely distributed in the human respiratory system, digestive tract system, and reproductive system[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Previous research has shown that ABO blood group are related to the onset and spread of various diseases because the blood group antigens may participate in virus infection as receptor[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. In the study of various susceptible genes in SARS-CoV, individuals in the blood group O have a lower infection rate[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Guillon et al found that A antibody can provide protection by inhibiting interaction between the virus and ACE2 receptor[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. However, the higher proportion of patients with type A blood is temporarily unclear and the reason may be the lack of antibody A protection. Further research is need to explore the specific mechanism.<br/><br/>The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are non-specific, which is consistent with previous studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], the most common symptom is fever. However, not all patients had fever and 10(9.90%) cases of patients were not detected fever in the onset. Moreover, 21(20.79%) of the patients had no respiratory symptoms when they the disease started, and symptoms such as fever and chest tightness gradually occurred as the disease progressed. Therefore, the delay of fever and respiratory symptoms may affect the early recognition probably.<br/><br/>The mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is high, but its mechanism is not clear at present, and it may be related to the virus-induced acute lung injury, inflammatory factor storm, multiple organ damage and secondary nosocomial infections. We collected Laboratory examination results of patients at admission, at the time of transfer to the ICU, and at 48h before death and found that 71(70.30%) of patients had an elevated level of IL-6 when they were admitted to hospital, and it gradually increased as disease progressed and was as high as 26.21pg/mL(IQR11.68-205.92) 48h before death, which is significantly higher than results reported by Chen et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>],Considering that these patients have severe inflammatory reaction.We found that 23(22.78%) of patients had abnormal coagulation function at admission, which is mainly manifested as increased D-D and a sudden deterioration,we need to be vigilant about the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism after micro-thrombosis in the lungs or deep vein thrombosis. For hypercoagulable patients without contraindications, reasonable anticoagulant therapy is a possible strategy.<br/><br/>It has been reported that the 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCov) can damage function of organs such as the lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, etc., but there was no relevant description of the involvement sequence of other organs except lung. We collected indicators of organ damage when patients were admitted to the hospital and found that<br/><br/>, Most of patients had myocardial damage of which 32 patients were only complicated with myocardial damage.2019-nCov and 2003-SARS both belong to the \u03b2 coronavirus genus, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been confirmed as a common pathogenic target[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. 31% of ICU patients were detected significant abnormalities in Troponin I(TNI) in Huang\u2019s research[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. This study found that TNI was significantly higher in the ICU or before death , compared with when they were admitted to hospital. Further analysis revealed that patients who enter hospital with elevated troponin survive a faster progress from paroxysm to ICU and a shorter overall duration. The duration will be even shorter if increase in TNI accompanied. The above results suggest that heart is a potential target for 2019-nCOV and it impacts the disease process, so we need to monitor and evaluate heart damage early while focusing on lung injury.<br/><br/>We found that as the disease progressed, patients' leukocytes, neutrophils, PCT, CRP, etc. gradually increased, while lymphocytes increased again after the decline, and some patients experienced a drop in body temperature and then increased or continued temperature fluctuations. These indicators do not fully meet the characteristics of viral infections. It is necessary to be alert to that patients who may have bacterial infections. The sputum culture results also proved that some patients had bacterial and fungal infections, among which Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans were most common bacteria. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections in patients may be related to low immune function, severe lack of medical resources and unsmooth sputum drainage. In addition, we need to be aware that clinical manifestations of bacterial or fungal infections for critically ill patients may be not typical because their immune function is extremely low and most of them are in hormone therapy. However, the disease progress is rapid and can exacerbate in a short period of time leading to death. Therefore, it is necessary to pay close attention to changes in patient temperature, laboratory indicators, imaging indicators and airway secretion characteristics. Prevention and control of nosocomial infections also need to be strengthened.<br/><br/>In terms of treatment, usage of antiviral drugs and hormones and related course is still controversial. In this study, 60.40% of patients used antiviral drugs, 58.42% patients used glucocorticoids, and the treatment course was mostly 3-5 days. All patients received antibiotic treatment including cephalosporins and quinolones. More than half of patients used restricted antibiotics due to fluctuations in body temperature or inflammation indicators. Mechanical ventilation is the main supportive treatment for critically ill patients, but the overall survival time of patients after invasive mechanical ventilation was short(median 5 days [IQR2.00-8.00]), and most patients did not benefit significantly from invasive mechanical ventilation. Most patients had suffered multiple organ failure caused by severe hypoxia before invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore, for critical patients, early invasive mechanical ventilation treatment should be in consideration.<br/><br/>This study has some limitations. Only the critically death patients include in the group, and there is no comparison between the improvement groups. The sample size can be increased in further research for prospective case-control study. The blood group composition of patients cannot be statistically analyzed and whether the blood group difference is related to the susceptibility and mortality needs further study."

In the death cases, 47 patients went directly to the ICU because of critical condition, and 54 patients were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition. All cases died in the end. Among them, 1 patients died with the symptom of acute coronary artery, while the rest of them died with the symptom of respiratory failure and multiple organ failure caused by COVID-19. The cases included 64 males and 37 females with the age range of 24-83 and average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The majority had basic diseases with hypertension 42.57%, diabetes 22.77%, neurological disease 9.90%, malignant tumor 4.95%, and respiratory disease 4.95%.

The most common symptom was fever (91 [90.10%] of 101 patients), but most patients dropped to normal temperature after admission 1-3 days, which may be related to hormone use. Cough (69 [68.32%]) and dyspnea (75 [74.26%]) were also common symptoms. 31(30.69%) patients had sputum symptoms in the early stage with white sputum, and 3 patients showed yellowish purulent sputum. 50(49.50%) patients showed Acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) at the time of admission, and the median time from onset to ARDS was 12 days(IQR9.00-14.00).Other common symptoms included myalgia, general weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, among which 86(85.15%) patients had more than two symptoms.21(20.79%) patients had no respiratory symptoms, and 7(6.93%) patients initially appeared gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.

It was found that patient's platelets(PLT) decreased, D-dimer and Prothrombin time(PT) increased correspondingly during disease progression via dynamic analysis of coagulation-related indicators. Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission(83 [82.18%] of 101 patients). With the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased. It also indicated that there was a high proportion of myocardial damage in the early stage.

        "4. DISCUSSION": [
            "Our study reported the clinical characteristics of 101 deaths from COVID-19. As far as we know, this is the largest sample among the research reports on the clinical characteristics of dead patients. Although previous studies included some deaths, the number of cases were less.",
            "Up to 5th March, 2020, the cumulative number of infected people wordwild was 95,333, and the number of death was 3,282. The mortality rate was as high as 3.4%, which is much higher than that of general pneumonia. Among the 101 deaths, male is significantly higher than female, and the proportion of elderly patients with basic diseases is relatively high. The average age of death patients in this study was significantly higher than previous studies. In the study, we found the blood group composition of death patients (A-42.57%, B-30.69%, O-17.82%, AB-8.91%) was different from that of Han population in Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Type O was relatively low, and Type A was relatively high. The mechanism which caused this is still unclear. ABO blood group antigen substances are widely distributed in the human respiratory system, digestive tract system, and reproductive system[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Previous research has shown that ABO blood group are related to the onset and spread of various diseases because the blood group antigens may participate in virus infection as receptor[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. In the study of various susceptible genes in SARS-CoV, individuals in the blood group O have a lower infection rate[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Guillon et al found that A antibody can provide protection by inhibiting interaction between the virus and ACE2 receptor[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. However, the higher proportion of patients with type A blood is temporarily unclear and the reason may be the lack of antibody A protection. Further research is need to explore the specific mechanism.",
            "The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are non-specific, which is consistent with previous studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], the most common symptom is fever. However, not all patients had fever and 10(9.90%) cases of patients were not detected fever in the onset. Moreover, 21(20.79%) of the patients had no respiratory symptoms when they the disease started, and symptoms such as fever and chest tightness gradually occurred as the disease progressed. Therefore, the delay of fever and respiratory symptoms may affect the early recognition probably.",
            "The mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is high, but its mechanism is not clear at present, and it may be related to the virus-induced acute lung injury, inflammatory factor storm, multiple organ damage and secondary nosocomial infections. We collected Laboratory examination results of patients at admission, at the time of transfer to the ICU, and at 48h before death and found that 71(70.30%) of patients had an elevated level of IL-6 when they were admitted to hospital, and it gradually increased as disease progressed and was as high as 26.21pg/mL(IQR11.68-205.92) 48h before death, which is significantly higher than results reported by Chen et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>],Considering that these patients have severe inflammatory reaction.We found that 23(22.78%) of patients had abnormal coagulation function at admission, which is mainly manifested as increased D-D and a sudden deterioration,we need to be vigilant about the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism after micro-thrombosis in the lungs or deep vein thrombosis. For hypercoagulable patients without contraindications, reasonable anticoagulant therapy is a possible strategy.",
            "It has been reported that the 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCov) can damage function of organs such as the lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, etc., but there was no relevant description of the involvement sequence of other organs except lung. We collected indicators of organ damage when patients were admitted to the hospital and found that",
            ", Most of patients had myocardial damage of which 32 patients were only complicated with myocardial damage.2019-nCov and 2003-SARS both belong to the \u03b2 coronavirus genus, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been confirmed as a common pathogenic target[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. 31% of ICU patients were detected significant abnormalities in Troponin I(TNI) in Huang\u2019s research[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. This study found that TNI was significantly higher in the ICU or before death , compared with when they were admitted to hospital. Further analysis revealed that patients who enter hospital with elevated troponin survive a faster progress from paroxysm to ICU and a shorter overall duration. The duration will be even shorter if increase in TNI accompanied. The above results suggest that heart is a potential target for 2019-nCOV and it impacts the disease process, so we need to monitor and evaluate heart damage early while focusing on lung injury.",
            "We found that as the disease progressed, patients' leukocytes, neutrophils, PCT, CRP, etc. gradually increased, while lymphocytes increased again after the decline, and some patients experienced a drop in body temperature and then increased or continued temperature fluctuations. These indicators do not fully meet the characteristics of viral infections. It is necessary to be alert to that patients who may have bacterial infections. The sputum culture results also proved that some patients had bacterial and fungal infections, among which Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans were most common bacteria. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections in patients may be related to low immune function, severe lack of medical resources and unsmooth sputum drainage. In addition, we need to be aware that clinical manifestations of bacterial or fungal infections for critically ill patients may be not typical because their immune function is extremely low and most of them are in hormone therapy. However, the disease progress is rapid and can exacerbate in a short period of time leading to death. Therefore, it is necessary to pay close attention to changes in patient temperature, laboratory indicators, imaging indicators and airway secretion characteristics. Prevention and control of nosocomial infections also need to be strengthened.",
            "In terms of treatment, usage of antiviral drugs and hormones and related course is still controversial. In this study, 60.40% of patients used antiviral drugs, 58.42% patients used glucocorticoids, and the treatment course was mostly 3-5 days. All patients received antibiotic treatment including cephalosporins and quinolones. More than half of patients used restricted antibiotics due to fluctuations in body temperature or inflammation indicators. Mechanical ventilation is the main supportive treatment for critically ill patients, but the overall survival time of patients after invasive mechanical ventilation was short(median 5 days [IQR2.00-8.00]), and most patients did not benefit significantly from invasive mechanical ventilation. Most patients had suffered multiple organ failure caused by severe hypoxia before invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore, for critical patients, early invasive mechanical ventilation treatment should be in consideration.",
            "This study has some limitations. Only the critically death patients include in the group, and there is no comparison between the improvement groups. The sample size can be increased in further research for prospective case-control study. The blood group composition of patients cannot be statistically analyzed and whether the blood group difference is related to the susceptibility and mortality needs further study."
