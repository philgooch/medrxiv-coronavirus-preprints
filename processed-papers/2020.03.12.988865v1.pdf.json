        "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the\nSARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing 6 shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses,",

The coverage of the 3\u2032 side of the viral genome is substantially higher than that of the 5\u2032 side, which reflects the nested sgRNAs. This is also partly due to the 3 bias of directional DRS technique. The presence of the leader sequence (72 nt) in viral RNAs results in a prominent coverage peak at the 5\u2032 end, as expected. We could also clearly detect vertical drops in the coverage, whose positions correspond to the leader-body junction in sgRNAs.

It is important to note that ORF10 is represented by only one read in DNB data (0.000009 % of viral junction-spanning reads) and that it was not supported at all by DRS data. ORF10 does not show significant homology to known proteins. Thus, ORF10 is unlikely to be expressed, and the annotation of ORF10 should be reconsidered.

B, The ionic current signals from viral N transcript at the genomic position 29,016 (yellow lines) are similar to those from IVT control RNA (black lines), indicating that modification is not frequent on the N sgRNA. C, Ionic current distribution at A29016. Blue line shows the signal distribution in the standard model of Tombo 1.5. D, Dwell time difference supports RNA modification. The dwell time of the region 29,015-29,017 of the S RNA (right) is significantly longer than those of IVT control and N RNAs. On the contrary, the neighboring region 28,995-28,997 does not show the difference among IVT, N, and S RNA (left).

Interestingly, modified RNA molecules have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified ones (Fig. 5H and SFig. 3). These results suggest a link between internal modification and 3\u2032 end tail. Since poly(A) tail plays an important role in RNA turnover, it is tempting to speculate that the observed internal modification is involved in viral RNA stability control.",
            "It is also plausible that RNA modification is a mechanism to evade host immune response.
