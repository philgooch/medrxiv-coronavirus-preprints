We consecutively enrolled a total of 572 participants at Ningbo First Hospital in China in this study (Figure 1).<br/><br/>The exclusion criteria included: (i) Age \u2264 18 years (n = 6); (ii) Wearing hearing aid, or having a cerumen (n = 7); (iii) Participants with soft tissue infection or trauma (n =3); (iv)<br/><br/>Missing data of wrist, forehead, and tympanic temperature (n = 4); and (v) Participants whose forehead temperature measurements showed \u201clow\u201d (n = 23). We finally enrolled 528 eligible participants for the final analysis, including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. The 261 indoor participants were from the fever clinic and emergency department, and the 267 outdoor participants included patients and accompanying family members. The data of indoor participants were collected consecutively between February 14th and February 20th, 2020.<br/><br/>The data of outdoor participants were collected on February 14th, 15th, 17th, 2020.<br/><br/>Temperature readings were taken by trained and experienced nurses. Each participant was measured for wrist, forehead, and tympanic temperature twice. The temperatures were recorded by mean wrist temperature, forehead, and tympanic temperature, respectively. Data regarding age, gender, transportation, occupation, and temperature were recorded immediately by the nurse to pre-printed files.<br/><br/>The study was approved by Ningbo First Hospital Ethics Committee. All participants were asked verbally. They gave their oral informed consent in this study. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier number: NCT04274621.<br/><br/>Assessment of environment<br/><br/>Indoor patients at the fever clinic and emergency department were those who has been indoors for at least a few minutes. The outdoor participants were divided into four type according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle/electric vehicle, car, and inside the car.<br/><br/>Measurement of temperature<br/><br/>Tympanic temperature was measured using IRTT (Braun ThermoScan PRO 6000). Wrist and forehead temperature were measured using NCIT. The NCIT was ranged 32.0\u201342.9\u00b0C.<br/><br/>The accuracy was \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C. NCIT measurements were taken following the manufacturer's instructions in the mid-forehead and a region at 10 cm above the palmar side of the wrist.<br/><br/>After pulling the pinna backward, the nurse inserted IRTT into the external auditory meatus.<br/><br/>The probe was held in the same position until the \u201cbeep\u201d was heard. Temperature readings were taken by the same trained nurse in the following order: forehead, forehead (the second time), left wrist, right wrist, left tympanic, and right tympanic. The data were recorded by another researcher in pre-printed files. Tympanic membrane is in close proximity to the hypothalamus and the internal carotid artery (10). Thus, tympanic temperature is considered to directly reflect core temperature (11), and was defined as the gold standard in this study.<br/><br/>These thermometers were stabilized before measurements. Calibration of thermometers were checked by the Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau, Ningbo, China. It was according to Calibration Specification of Infrared Thermometers for Measurement of Human<br/><br/>Temperature (JJF1107-2003).<br/><br/>Statistical analysis<br/><br/>Power calculation was performed for sample size. The following parameters were used: a power of 90%, an \u03b1-error level of 0.05, estimating a standard deviation of 1\u00b0C and a potential allowable error of 0.2\u00b0C. Considering a 10% possibility of dropouts and otherwise missing data, at least 293 subjects were needed in our study.<br/><br/>Continuous variables were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), and categorical data in frequency and proportion.<br/><br/>The tympanic temperature were analyzed by Bland\u2013Altman analysis (12). It also showed three superimposed horizontal lines. Red dashed line highlighted mean bias among all the paired measurements. Black dashed line marked upper and lower 95% Limits of Agreement (LoA).<br/><br/>A temperature deviation of 0.5\u00b0C was considered as clinically acceptable (13). A tympanic temperature of \u2265 37.3\u00b0C was defined as the cut-off point for fever.

            "In this prospective real-world study, we found that wrist temperature measurement is more stable than forehead using NCIT under different circumstances in outdoor participants.<br/><br/>Both measurement had significantly great abilities of screening patients for fever in indoor patients. The cut-off value for wrist and forehead temperature were both 36.2\u00b0C. They showed good sensitivity. It may assist for fever screening in the population, especially in the outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). To our knowledge, this study was the first to explore the reliability and validity of wrist and forehead temperature measurement in mass screening.<br/><br/>Previous studies showed that axilla, rectal temperature were the gold standards in clinical practice (14, 15). However, it was impractical for the large-scale screening. Timesaving and less invasive tools were needed. IRTT and NCIT are being applied in the general population during the epidemic. A lot of disposable plastic covers were consumed, which may increase the financial burden. In China, it cost 1\u20132 RMB (about 0.2 dollars) for per disposable plastic cover. Besides, indirect contacts increased the risk of cross infection. Forehead temperature was used for the widespread use of population screening using NCIT. However, it can be affected by a person\u2019s physiological and environmental conditions (8, 16). The forehead temperature value of 23 participants showed \u201clow\u201d in our study. This all happened on the same day (February 17th, 2020) with an outside temperature of 7\u00b0C. Thus, we chose wrist temperature as an alternative, especially in the winter when mass screening is needed. Wrist measurement indicated peripheral temperature at 10 cm above the palmar side of the wrist. It was within our expectation that wrist measurement readings attained was lower than tympanic route. However, this area was covered by clothing all the time. It was less influenced by environmental conditions. Our study showed it was more stable for participants under different circumstance than forehead measurement. It is important for mass screen in the open air during the Outbreak of COVID-19. The ROC curves showed wrist and forehead measurement had significantly great abilities of screening patients for fever. The cut-off value of both measurement was 36.2\u00b0C. It can be applied in clinical practice and assist to improve the standardization of both practical use and performance.<br/><br/>The strengths of this study included its large sample size, and prospective design in the real-world setting. There were several limitations. First, it is difficult to quantify the physiological and environmental conditions. Second, only one brand of thermometer was enrolled in this study. It was uncertain that it could be generalized to all brands of thermometers in the market.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this study confirmed wrist measurement was more stable for participants under different circumstance than forehead measurement. Both measurement had significantly great fever screening abilities for indoor patients, and the cut-off value of both measurements for fever was 36.2\u00b0C.

        "A previous study suggested to acclimate to the indoor temperature for at least min for those who were exposed to the cold before taking body temperature readings (8)",
        "It is not practical for mass screening in winter during the outbreak of COVID-19.",

        "Introduction": [
            "The outbreaks of 2019 novel coronavirus COVID-19<br/><br/>has attracted global attention, due to its strong transmission ability and certain fatality (1, 2).<br/><br/>Some studies reported that fever, fatigue and dry cough are common symptoms of<br/><br/>COVID-19 patients (3, 4), and 43.8% of the patients showed fever before admission with it largely being the first symptom (5).",
            "A previous study suggested to acclimate to the indoor temperature for at least min for those who were exposed to the cold before taking body temperature readings (8)",
            "It is not practical for mass screening in winter during the outbreak of COVID-19.",
            "Previous study showed wearable devices (WD) on the wrist were applied in temperature monitoring in clinical practice (9)",
            "It brings a challenge whether it can be used as an accurate, safe and cost-effective screening tool in this outbreak.",
            "It may assist to improve the standardization of both practical use and performance, especially indispensable in the pandemic 2019-nCoV situation"
        ],
        "Methods": [
            "The authors performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. The authors consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (\u00b0C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT).",
            "The authors measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature \u226537.3\u00b0C",
            "This was a prospective observational study in a real-life population.",
            "Each participant was measured for wrist, forehead, and tympanic temperature twice.",
            "Tympanic temperature is considered to directly reflect core temperature (11), and was defined as the gold standard in this study",
            "These thermometers were stabilized before measurements.",
            "Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.5.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "The authors enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants.",
            "The authors divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car.",
            "Outdoor participants were divided into four types as walk, bicycle or electric vehicle, car, and inside the car",
            "For those who walked, the agreement limits for wrist and tympanic was between -2.05 and 0.34\u00b0C; -4.07 and 0.64\u00b0C for forehead and tympanic (Figure 2A, B).",
            "Figure 4 shows the comparison between wrist and forehead measurements for detection of fever.",
            "The best threshold of forehead measurement was 36.2\u00b06 with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "In this prospective real-world study, the authors found that wrist temperature measurement is more stable than forehead using NCIT under different circumstances in outdoor participants",
            "Both measurement had significantly great abilities of screening patients for fever in indoor patients.",
            "This study confirmed wrist measurement was more stable for participants under different circumstance than forehead measurement",
            "Both measurement had significantly great fever screening abilities for indoor patients, and the cut-off value of both measurements for fever was 36.2\u00b0C.",
            "The cut-off value of both measurements was 36.2\u00b0C. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04274621)"
