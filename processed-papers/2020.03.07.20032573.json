        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nClinical characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) have been described in numerous studies but yielded varying results. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic.\nMETHODS\nSystematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed.\nRESULTS\nSeventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. A total of 3470 COVID-19 patients were synthesized to the final analysis in an unbiased manner. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p&lt;0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that of non-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p&lt;0.001). \nINTERPRETATION\nThis large patient-based systematic review presents a more precise profiling of the COVID-19 from its outbreak to current pandemic. Dynamic evolvements of COVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies.",

            "In summary, COVID-19 represents an emerging acute respiratory infection with various clinical presentations that share similarities as well as discrepancies with SARS and MERS. Combining clinical presentations with radiographic findings as well as blood tests may add value in early diagnosis and managements. Dynamic changes of clinical features in the course of COVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies. Since specific treatments are not available at the moment, urgent efforts should be taken to explore for this emerging disease."

These patients were admitted to hospitals between December 11, 2019 and February 14, 2020, which covered a period from COVID-19 outbreak to its global pandemic. To our knowledge, this updated systematic review analyzed the largest number of cases demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, which covers ten countries. As of March 5, 2020, there have been 95,333 confirmed cases distributing over 86 countries[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. The rapid and wide spreading of the infection has clearly shown the pandemic potential of COVID-19, to which we should pay great attention.<br/><br/>Through literature searching and data extraction, we included 3,470 confirmed cases of COVID-19 based on the positive assays of SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR or antibody detection. The present study showed that the infected patients aged from 17-day to 92-year old. A recent report by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) have shown that 86.6% the patients aged 30-79 years[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. This study together with China CDC report indicated that the general population, regardless of age, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The general ratio of male to female gender of the present study (1.10:1) is also similar to China CDC report (1.06:1), indicating that COVID-19 may not have a gender predisposition. Although 13.2% of the selected patients had a history of smoking, we could not draw the conclusion that smokers are less susceptible to the viral infection than non-smokers, as the patients included in our analysis were from a sample pool that was not representative the general population by smoking status."

            "Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a large number of articles have been published reporting epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of this emerging disease. Huang et al first reported 41 cases of COVID-19 in which 66% patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Market, Wuhan. Common symptoms of the case series were fever (98%), cough (76%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%) with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 15%6. Chen et al in a subsequent study found that 99 cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to the same hospital (Jin Yin-tan Hospital, Wuhan) had similar trends of symptoms and CFR (11%)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Another case series analysis of 138 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan showed a relatively higher rate of fatigue symptom (69.6%) but lower CFR (4.3%) when compared to the above center[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Lastly, Xu et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] found in a multicenter-based retrospective study that clinical symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are milder than those observed in Wuhan, China. Similarly, a nationwide multicenter study in China showed that patients with COVID-19 did not have a specific clinical symptom[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The clinical traits of COVID-19 are of great importance for the early identification of cases and for developing isolation and preventive strategies. However, there exist inconsistent findings of the clinical characteristics of",

Notably, variation in reporting descriptive data may lead to the misunderstanding of COVID-9 characteristics. In this updated systematic review, hence, we sought to address the heterogeneities among published retrospective studies and to synthesize the available data.

Through a synthesized analysis, a total of 2182 cases (76.0%) had a history of transmission exposures, i.e., the patients were either Wuhan residents or travelled to Wuhan within the past 14 days.",
            "Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 The most common symptom of COVID-19 was fever (2878 [83.0%]), followed by cough (2102 [61.0%]), fatigue (942 [37.9%]), sputum production (720 [28.7%]), dyspnea (412 [14.5%]), muscle aches (477 [18.6%]). Less common symptoms were headache (318 [11.8]), sore throat (289 [14.0%]), gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea or vomiting account for 185 [8.9%]) and upper airway symptoms (rhinorrhea, sneeze or nasal congestion account for 162 [7.6%]) and diarrhea (165 [6.1%]) (Figure 2). Further analysis showed that only 1522 [63.4%] of the patients had fever as their onset symptom.",
            "Of the selected patients, 888 [31.5%] cases co-existed with underlying chronic disorders, such as hypertension [13.3%], diabetes [7.3%], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [1.4%], cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [8.3%], malignancy [1.5%], chronic liver disease [2.1%] and chronic kidney disease [0.7%] (See Table 3 for details). Common complications of COVID-19 included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (136 [8.9%]), shock (29 [2.2%]) and acute renal failure (30 [2.1%]).",
            "Radiological findings revealed that 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal presentations on chest CT (Figure 3A), with either bilateral or unilateral ground-glass/consolidative pulmonary opacities. Laboratory blood tests showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 1.0 \u00d7 109/L), while 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases presented an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP) (Figure 3 B-C).",
            "Other Outcomes Collectively, a total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall CFR was 3.7% (Table 2). Our further analysis showed that COVID-19 patients admitted in Hubei province (Wuhan in particular) suffered from a significant higher ICU admission rate than that outside of Hubei, China (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 in Hubei province, China was significantly higher than that in non-Hubei, China (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001)."

        "Discussion": [
            "This review analyzed clinical data on COVID-19 patients enrolled retrospectively in published studies. These patients were admitted to hospitals between December 11, 2019 and February 14, 2020, which covered a period from COVID-19 outbreak to its global pandemic. To our knowledge, this updated systematic review analyzed the largest number of cases demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, which covers ten countries. As of March 5, 2020, there have been 95,333 confirmed cases distributing over 86 countries[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. The rapid and wide spreading of the infection has clearly shown the pandemic potential of COVID-19, to which we should pay great attention.",
            "Through literature searching and data extraction, we included 3,470 confirmed cases of COVID-19 based on the positive assays of SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR or antibody detection. The present study showed that the infected patients aged from 17-day to 92-year old. A recent report by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) have shown that 86.6% the patients aged 30-79 years[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. This study together with China CDC report indicated that the general population, regardless of age, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The general ratio of male to female gender of the present study (1.10:1) is also similar to China CDC report (1.06:1), indicating that COVID-19 may not have a gender predisposition. Although 13.2% of the selected patients had a history of smoking, we could not draw the conclusion that smokers are less susceptible to the viral infection than non-smokers, as the patients included in our analysis were from a sample pool that was not representative the general population by smoking status.",
            "This systematic review showed that most of the patients (76.0%) had a history of Wuhan-related exposures. This is of great importance for early quarantine for the subjects with emerging infectious disease when specific treatments are not available. Actually, we have learned from the SARS outbreak 17 years ago that early identification, early isolation and early management would lead to the stop of viral transmissions from human to human[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c79\" href=\"#r79\">79</a>]. Collectively, there were 36% of the COVID-19 patients absent from fever as the onset symptom. In this case, such patients may have been ignored at the early stage if we focused heavily on fever examination for initial screening. Our composite analysis showed that fever remains the most common symptom (83.0%) in patients with COVID-19. However, the proportion of fever is somewhat lower than that of other coronavirus related respiratory illness, such as SARS (100%)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>] or middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) (98%)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>]. Similarly, the accompanied symptoms of dyspnea (14.5%) and diarrhea (6.1%) are relatively less common in patients with COVID-19 than those seen in SARS and MERS52. More importantly, this study revealed an overall CFR of 3.7%, which was quite similar to that reported by the WHO official statistics as of March 5, 2020 (CFR 3.7%, 3,015 died of 80,565 cases)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Nevertheless, the CFR of COVID-19 was much lower than that of SARS (9.6%)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>] and MERS (37.1%)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>]. By far, the mechanisms underlying the varying symptoms and CFR for these three coronavirus-infected diseases are not fully understood. One reason may be that there were still some COVID-19 patients being treated in hospitals at the time of the manuscripts submitted, so the outcome (death or recovery) is not known yet. Additionally, we suppose that the varied tropism as well as virulence of these three coronaviruses may in part account for the discrepancies, which warrants further investigations.",
            "According to the seven version Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>], typical CT findings of early COVID-19 are characterized by multiple small patchy shadows and then developed into bilateral pulmonary ground-glass or consolidative opacities. In our summary, most of the patients (88.2%) had abnormal findings in the lungs with chest CT scan. In some early cases of COVID-19, clear evidence of pneumonia has been shown on HRCT while X-ray radiographic findings are still normal[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. Thus, chest CT scan should be routinely recommended for the early identification of COVID-19. Routine blood tests showed that 62.8% of COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia, of which the level is relatively lower than that of SARS86. Similarly, a large proportion (64.8%) of COVID-19 patients had an increase level of CRP. Taken together, a combination of the epidemiologic history with auxiliary examinations, e.g., chest CT scan and blood tests, will improve the diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19.",
            "Our further analysis revealed that patients admitted in Hubei province (Wuhan in particular) are facing much more severe situations (higher ICU admission rate and CFR) than those diagnosed in other parts of China. Reasons for the tough situations being caught in Hubei province might be as follows. Firstly, the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 had not been cutting down at its early stage in Wuhan, Hubei province. Second, when encountering such a large number of infected patients, a limited healthcare workforce in Wuhan could not support to treat all patients at their mild or moderate stage. This might result in a higher rate of ICU admission or CFR. Since substantial number of patients as well as healthy residents have been kept in lockdown of Wuhan, great efforts are urgently needed to cutdown the virus transmission from COVID-19 patients to local healthy residents.",
            "This systematic review has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective nature of selected literatures, not all clinical characteristics have been well documented. This have resulted in an inconsistence of the total numbers of each item being calculated. Second, some of the selected patients may not have discharged before the studies were finalized. This might have affected the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 to some extents. Third, since the disease is still ongoing, newly published data on COVID-19 might not be included at the time of manuscript submission. Nevertheless, we have summarized the largest number of patients demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in the present study. Finally, we could not determine the incubation periods of COVID-19 due to heterogeneity across studies in reporting the timeline of cases.",
            "In summary, COVID-19 represents an emerging acute respiratory infection with various clinical presentations that share similarities as well as discrepancies with SARS and MERS. Combining clinical presentations with radiographic findings as well as blood tests may add value in early diagnosis and managements. Dynamic changes of clinical features in the course of COVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies. Since specific treatments are not available at the moment, urgent efforts should be taken to explore for this emerging disease."
