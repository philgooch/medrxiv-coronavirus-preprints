        "abstract": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the facemask shortage during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak in China. We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.",

            "An increasing number of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases were initially identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and can be transmitted between humans 1-3. Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia or fatigue, while less common symptoms include sputum production, headache, haemoptysis, and diarrhoea 4. In mid-February 2020, the reported incidence of COVID-19 cases exceeded 60,000 in China, of which more than 70% was in Wuhan city and more than 80% was in Hubei province 5,6. Globally, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, France, Canada, Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and 13 other countries had reported COVID-19 cases 7.

The number of new cases is expected to decline after the epidemic peak, but the viral transmission is still possible and the need for facemask will not decrease immediately. Therefore, our analysis covered the period from 31 Dec 2019 to 30 Apr 2020 (121 days in total). To simulate the facemask availability in China, we used a mathematical model based on data and assumptions on the production, import, and need.

        "discussion": [
            "In this study, we summarized the public health measures introduced by the Chinese government during the COVID-19 outbreak and simulated the facemask availability in three scenarios based on the scale of the outbreak. Our results suggested that if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan (about 11.1 million population) or Hubei province (about 59.2 million population), a facemask shortage would not happen in China. We also simulated the facemask availability in three scenarios regarding different facemask productivity during the outbreak. Our analysis showed that if the outbreak occurs in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask would appear in less than a week and could be substantial under the existing public health measures. Only a dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times the usual level) could mitigate the facemask shortage in time.<br/><br/>During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government introduced various measures, such as lockdown of cities, shutdown of the transportation system, and legislation on mandatory facemasks wearing in public 23. However, the implementation of these responses was not always timely, and the virus eventually spread to the entire country. As soon as the general population began to realise the severity of the outbreak, facemask consumption surged in only a few days, partly due to panic buying. Although domestic productivity has resumed after the Chinese New Year holiday and global imports have increased, facemask crisis was not resolved. Under these circumstances, many avoided leaving their apartments and tried to extend the lifespan of each facemask by all means 24,25, school was closed, online learning resources became widely available, and public facilities were mostly not opened. In this way, the demand for facemasks in the general population is expected to decline and more resources could be saved for healthcare workers 26."

        "limitations": [
            "There are some limitations in this study. First, our estimation relied on the assumptions of facemask productivity, import, storage, and need. Relevant information was limited at the time when the analyses were performed (during the outbreak). Second, we did not take into account the logistics cost that could restrict the supplies on the markets. Thus, our analysis is likely to underestimate the severity of the facemask shortage experiencing by the healthcare workers and the general population. Third, we didn\u2019t consider the types of facemasks that should be used by individuals at different risk levels 29. The situation of facemasks shortage might be more severe when considering the demand for different types of facemasks from healthcare workers (most required KN95/N95 respirators and medical protective masks) and the general population 29. Fourth, our prediction ended in late-April considering the epidemic was predicted to fade out at about the same time 30. However, if the transmissibility of the epidemic could be reduced, the peak and the end would be delayed 31, the daily incidence and the demand for facemasks and other medical supplies would also decrease. Nevertheless, the anxiety in the population may result in constant demand for facemasks even when the epidemic is under controlled. Conclusion and policy implication In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries."

Regarding the respiratory hygiene measures, facemask wearing is considered as one of the most cost-effective and important measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but it became a social concern due to the recent global facemask shortage 9-12.",

At the usual time, China can produce 20 million facemasks per day while the productivity during the Chinese New Year holiday was lower (12 million facemasks per day) 13. However, even full productivity does not seem to meet the need of a population of 1\u00b74 billion in China. Therefore, to control the COVID-19 epidemic, the Chinese government imported more than 730 million facemasks between 24 Jan 2020 and 11 Feb 2020 13,14 and extended the Chinese New Year holiday to allow for home quarantine and to reduce the need for facemasks and other medical resources. A number of factories also resumed partial productivity during the holiday by paying extra to their workers 15.",

            "The parameters included in the mathematical model were estimated based on the data released by the NHC, MIIT, and CDC of the People\u2019s Republic of China or recent investigation on the outbreak. Model input and assumptions in our model are summarized in Table 1. Specifically, the population and the numbers of healthcare workers in Wuhan city, Hubei province, and China were obtained from the Wuhan Bureau of Statistics and China Health Statistics Yearbook 2019 18-20. MIIT estimated that the daily facemask production in China is about 20 million at usual time 13. Facemask storage was estimated to be seven times the daily consumption in hospitals 9. We assume that 70% of the facemask storage in the whole of China would be supplied to the hospital system; thus, the baseline facemasks availability (Fa(0)) was estimated to be 246,006,500, which is about 12 times of the usual daily facemask productivity in China. In our model, we assumed all facemasks on the market and in storage are available for consumption. In other words, we did not take into account factors that may limit the supply on the market, such as logistics. We assumed that the daily facemask productivity (Fp(d)) changed during our prediction period due to the Chinese New Year holiday (24 Jan 2020 to 9 Feb 2020), the incentive to resume production, and new product lines. Specifically, we considered three scenarios for the changes of daily facemask productivity, i.e., 1) 100% productivity (20 million per day) before the Chinese New Year holiday, 40% to 60% productivity during the holiday, and 94% to 100% productivity after the holiday; 2) 100% productivity before the Chinese New Year holiday, 40% to 60% productivity during the holiday, and the productivity would increase from 94% after the holiday to 200% on 3 Mar 2020; 3) 100% productivity before the Chinese New Year holiday, 40% to 60% productivity during the holiday, and the productivity would increase from 94% to 400% on 3 Mar 2020 (See Table 1 for detailed description of each scenario). According to the MIIT and General Administration of Customs, the daily number of facemasks imported to China were 6,000,000 between 24 Jan 2020 and Jan 2020, 20,000,000 on Jan 202013, 56,166,667 between Jan 2020 and Feb 202014. Given a global facemask shortage has appeared in mid-February, we assumed a gradually decreasing daily import of facemask between Feb 2020 and 23 Mar 2020 from 50% to 10% of the import volume in early-February and maintained a 10% of the import volume in early-February from 23 Mar 2020 to 30 Apr 2020. Based on the clinical experience of chief physicians in China, we assumed that each healthcare worker would use five facemasks each day (\u03b1) at the usual time. And we assumed that each person in the general population would use one facemask each day (\u03b2). We assumed the percentage of the general population wearing facemasks (Pg(d)) to be close to 0% before the release of the national technical protocol for SARS-CoV-2 (the first version) by the NHC (i.e., 0<d\u226416) 2. The Pg(d) was assumed to be 20% after the NHC recommended facemasks wearing in the national technical protocol (the first version) (16<d\u226423), and 60% after the release of the national technical protocol for SARS-CoV-2 (the second version) and massive media cover (23<d\u226425) 21. The Chinese government suggested home quarantine for suspected cases and reducing gathering during the Chinese New Year holiday; thus, we assumed the Pg(d) to be 20% from 24 Jan 2020 to 9 Feb 2020 (25<d\u226441).

Our results suggested that if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan (about 11.1 million population) or Hubei province (about 59.2 million population), a facemask shortage would not happen in China. We also simulated the facemask availability in three scenarios regarding different facemask productivity during the outbreak. Our analysis showed that if the outbreak occurs in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask would appear in less than a week and could be substantial under the existing public health measures. Only a dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times the usual level) could mitigate the facemask shortage in time.",
            "During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government introduced various measures, such as lockdown of cities, shutdown of the transportation system, and legislation on mandatory facemasks wearing in public 23. However, the implementation of these responses was not always timely, and the virus eventually spread to the entire country. As soon as the general population began to realise the severity of the outbreak, facemask consumption surged in only a few days, partly due to panic buying. Although domestic productivity has resumed after the Chinese New Year holiday and global imports have increased, facemask crisis was not resolved. Under these circumstances, many avoided leaving their apartments and tried to extend the lifespan of each facemask by all means 24,25, school was closed, online learning resources became widely available, and public facilities were mostly not opened. In this way, the demand for facemasks in the general population is expected to decline and more resources could be saved for healthcare workers 26.",
            "Although our analysis was based on the COVID-19 outbreak in China, our findings could provide insight into the public health measures in other areas of the world, considering the outbreak occurs in city with a relatively high population mobility (e.g., London, New York, and Tokyo), and the virus could spread to the province/state where this city is located and even the entire country quickly. Therefore, governments across the world should revisit their emergency plan for controlling infectious disease outbreaks in the local context. Timely public health measures should be taken to control the outbreak within the city or the province/state where the city is located. Meanwhile, the supply of and demand for facemasks and other medical resources should be considered when planning for public health measures, so as to maintain the availability and affordability of medical resources. Besides, timely and effective communication with the public is essential to mitigate panic buying and anxiety in the population 27,28. Furthermore, during a medical resource crisis, health disparity could be widened between specific population groups. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to find themselves in a dilemma between the need to work in high-risk locations and the lack of protective equipment. In addition, market forces can drive the price up, preventing them from purchasing an adequate amount of protective equipment.",
            "In order to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic, a global collaboration to ease the medical resources crisis in the affected countries during an infectious disease outbreak should be established. With the shared information, the collaboration could promptly evaluate the severity of the outbreak and the availability of medical resources. Travel advice and guidance of self-protection should also account for the potential medical resouce crisis in the epidemic areas. Timely actions, such as increasing global productivity and distributing global storage, could be taken with a joint effort to minimize the risk of shortage and control the outbreak.",
            "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the facemask availability during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We have summarized in detail the public health measures introduced by the Chinese governments and considered three scenarios for the outbreak development. Nevertheless, there are some limitations in this study. First, our estimation relied on the assumptions of facemask productivity, import, storage, and need. Relevant information was limited at the time when the analyses were performed (during the outbreak). Second, we did not take into account the logistics cost that could restrict the supplies on the markets. Thus, our analysis is likely to underestimate the severity of the facemask shortage experiencing by the healthcare workers and the general population. Third, we didn\u2019t consider the types of facemasks that should be used by individuals at different risk levels 29. The situation of facemasks shortage might be more severe when considering the demand for different types of facemasks from healthcare workers (most required KN95/N95 respirators and medical protective masks) and the general population 29. Fourth, our prediction ended in late-April considering the epidemic was predicted to fade out at about the same time 30. However, if the transmissibility of the epidemic could be reduced, the peak and the end would be delayed 31, the daily incidence and the demand for facemasks and other medical supplies would also decrease. Nevertheless, the anxiety in the population may result in constant demand for facemasks even when the epidemic is under controlled. Conclusion and policy implication In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries."
