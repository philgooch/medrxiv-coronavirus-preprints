        "abstract": "The outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City of China obtained global concern, the population outflow from Wuhan has contributed to spatial expansion in other parts of China. We examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the epidemic.",

            "In conclusion, our study indicates that the population outflow from Wuhan might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the epidemic and earlier implementation would be more effective. The magnitude of epidemic might be under-estimated and should be paid more attention, such as Henan and Hunan provinces."

We examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the epidemic.",

Secondly, the absence of detectable symptoms during the long incubation period made it difficult to identify the cases in the early stage [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Thirdly, population movements increase the difficulty of case management and health education. All these factors promoted the transmission of 2019-nCoV. Specially, different from the H1N1 outbreak in 2009",
            "[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], the railways might play an important role in the disease transmission. Since railways were widely used before and during the Spring Festival, the area closely connected to Wuhan by railway should be the priority of infection control.",
            "Our study provided timely evidence for the formulation of efficient strategies to prevent diseases from spreading out. On the one hand, the result could help assess effectiveness of the prevention and control efforts. For example, the cases in Zhejiang and Guangdong are apparently more than estimated, which indicated a better health emergency response system (i.e. higher detection efficiency) or inadequate isolation.",
            "Whereas the cases reported in Henan were much lower than expected. Two possible explanations were considered: [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Strong prevention and control measures were adopted in Henan; [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] The epidemic in Henan has been underestimated and enhanced screening efforts should be enforced. On the other hand, exploring the association was expected to help identify high-risk areas and guide health strategy formulation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Take Henan for example, great difference between estimated and reported data may imply a great increase of cases in the future, which required enhancement of the surveillance system and rational allocation of resources [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. The medicine supply, personal protective equipment, hospital supplies, and the human resources necessary to respond to an outbreak should be always ensured [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. In addition, this study could be used to guide the assessment of the risk of disease transmission and help raise public awareness. As a large number of infected people had transported to all of 31 provinces, epidemics across the country may be inevitable. To halt the spread of the epidemic, harsh measures including quarantine and isolation of exposed persons, cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures, and travel restriction were needed to reduce transmission in affected areas. Furthermore, screening of people who have been to Wuhan recently was of crucial importance, especially cities with close ties to",
            "Wuhan.",
            "Considering the impact of population movements on the outbreak, the Wuhan government announced the suspension of public transportation on Jan 23, 2020, with a closure of airports, railway stations, and highways, to prevent further disease transmission [24]. Despite inconsistent reports on the role of the lockdown in halting the disease transmission across China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>, 25], the unprecedented measure might play an important role in slowing the epidemic spread, especially when an effective vaccine was developed [26, 27]. In addition, to explore the impact of date selection, we estimated the changes of cases when the measure was implemented on different date. The results varied significantly, 1420 cases could be prevented with the measure implemented two days earlier, and the number of cases will increase by 1462 with the lockdown implemented two days later, suggesting that the effect of the lockdown depending on the choice of date greatly, which could provide a reference for the future outbreaks. Since the political and economic effects were not considered, further studies on secondary impacts of the measure, like socioeconomic impacts, were also warranted. Though we estimated that some cases would possibly be prevented if the policy was implemented earlier, it was actually hard to make such a huge decision given the whole picture of the infection was not clear at that stage. The authors believe that the current policy was appropriate at this complex situation.",
            "There were a few limitations of our study. Firstly, for practical reasons, we used an indicator to reflect the real-time magnitude of population movements, which was acceptable considering our research purpose. Secondly, the influence of some important factors, such as socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, were not considered. Thirdly, it is assumed that the infected travelers in the population are randomly distributed [28], and that there was no significant difference in surveillance capability between cities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], which might not be the case in reality. In addition, daily data used in this study was reported infection data, rather than the actual number of incident cases. More detailed and further in-depth studies are warranted in the future.",
            "In conclusion, our study indicates that the population outflow from Wuhan might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the epidemic and earlier implementation would be more effective. The magnitude of epidemic might be under-estimated and should be paid more attention, such as Henan and Hunan provinces."

        ],
        "Results": [
            "As of January 31, 2020, a total of 11791 confirmed cases and 259 deaths due to the<br/><br/>2019-nCoV infection were reported in China, which were widely dispersed in all of provincial administrative areas.",
            "A total of 313 cities in mainland China reported the occurrence of 2019-nCoV infection, of which the number of reported cases from January 20 to 29 increased rapidly from 7 to 313, an increase of nearly 44 times.",
            "In the first stage from Jan 1 to Jan10, migrant population flowed out of Wuhan normally and returned to hometown without the influence of the epidemic situation",
            "At this point, the mean daily index of population outflow was 58039\u00b771 (95% CI: 48883\u00b738-66454\u00b700), and 2019-nCoV cases were mainly distributed in Wuhan."

        "Conclusion": [
            "Understanding the driving factors of the infectious disease is of particular importance for the timely formulation of effective controlling measures.",
            "The authors' results revealed a close relationship between the population outflow from Wuhan and the 2019-nCoV infection in other areas of China.",
            "Distribution of population outflows and cases varied across provinces.",
            "The authors' finding on the effects of population movement on the disease transmission was consistent with other coronaviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>].",
            "Since the infection is transmitted through the respiratory tract and close contact, it is greatly affected by population movements"
