        "abstract": "A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, recently discovered in Wuhan, China, has caused over 74000 infection cases and 2000 deaths. Due to the rapidly growing cases and the unavailability of specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we performed an in silico approach based on the available virus genome to identify the antigenic B-cell epitopes and human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes. A total of 61 B-cell epitopes were initially identified, 19 of which with higher potential 27 immunogenicity were used for vaccine design. 499 T-cell epitopes were predicted that showed 28 affinity with the 34 most popular HLA alleles in Chinese population. Based on these epitopes, 30 29 vaccine candidates were designed and inspected against safety risks, including potential toxicity, human homologous, pharmaceutical peptides and bioactive peptides. Majority of vaccine peptides contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes, which may interact with the most prevalent HLA alleles accounting for ~99% of Chinese population. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. In conclusion, these putative antigenic peptides may elicit the resistance response to the viral infection. In vitro and in vivo experiments are required to validate the effectiveness of these peptide vaccine.",

            "Since December 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China has become the center of an outbreak of viral lung infections caused by a new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (previously named<br/><br/>2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGorbalenya_2020_a\" href=\"#rGorbalenya_2020_a\">Gorbalenya, 2020</a>; Joseph T Wu*, 2020; Organization, 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPerlman_2020_a\" href=\"#rPerlman_2020_a\">Perlman, 2020</a>).The outbreak has so far infected over 74000 patients, and has spread to approximately 30 countries/regions worldwide. Comparisons of the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with other virus has shown 79.5% and 96% similarities at nucleotide level to<br/><br/>SARS-CoV and bat coronaviruses, respectively (Zhou et al, 2020), which suggested its probable origin in bats (Benvenuto et al, 2020). The main clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 patients are fever (\u226538oC), dry cough, low or normal peripheral white blood cell count, and low lymphocyte count, known as novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2020_a\">Huang et al, 2020</a>).<br/><br/>Currently, there is no approved therapeutics or vaccines available for the treatment of<br/><br/>COVID19 (Chen et al.). Due to lack of anti-viral drugs or vaccines, control measures have been relying on the rapid detection and isolation of symptomatic cases (Chen et al.). In this context, a safe and efficacious vaccine is urgently required. Traditional approaches for developing vaccines waste much time in isolating, inactivating and injecting the microorganisms (or portions of them) that cause disease. Fortunately, computation-based method enable us to start from analysis of viral genome, without the need to grow pathogens and therefore speeding up the entire process.<br/><br/>Complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has finished and paved the way for the vaccine development (Chen et al.). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes the spike protein, the membrane protein, the envelope protein, the nucleocapsid protein and a few replication and transcription-related enzymes. Given the lack of repairing mechanism of RNA virus replicase complex, mutations are prone to occur during virus replication. The 4% nucleotide difference of the virus isolated from Rhinolophus to that from human suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutates rapidly to achieve the host conversion (Jiayuan Chen, 2020). Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses its receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein to bind to the host\u2019s angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Chen et al.; Dong et al, 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTian_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rTian_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTian_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rTian_et+al_2020_a\">Tian et al, 2020</a></a>; Zhou et al, 2020). In terms of binding capacity, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is much stronger than<br/><br/>SARS-CoV and is considered to be between HKU3-4 which cannot bind to ACE2 receptor and rSHC014 which presents the largest binding energy (Gralinski and Menachery, 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhao_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhao_et+al_2020_a\">Zhao et al, 2020</a>). Consequently, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can be developed targeting the structural proteins, and in particular, the RBD region, following the strategy for the SARS-CoV vaccine development (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBabcock_et+al_2004_a\" href=\"#rBabcock_et+al_2004_a\">Babcock et al, 2004</a>; Buchholz et al, 2004; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHe_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rHe_et+al_2005_a\">He et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSaif_1993_a\" href=\"#rSaif_1993_a\">Saif, 1993</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTian_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rTian_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTian_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rTian_et+al_2020_a\">Tian et al, 2020</a></a>).<br/><br/>An ideal vaccine may contain both B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes, with combination of which vaccine is able to either induce specific humoral or cellular immune against pathogens efficiently (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPurcell_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rPurcell_et+al_2007_a\">Purcell et al, 2007</a>). Since the development of a peptide vaccine against the virus causing foot-and-mouth disease (Adam et al, 1978), the establishment of peptide synthesis method by Lerner et al (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLerner_et+al_1981_a\" href=\"#rLerner_et+al_1981_a\">Lerner et al, 1981</a>), along with the advent of a peptide vaccine design combining T-cell and B-cell epitopes, has accelerated the vaccine development. In the present study, we followed this in silico approach to identify the potential B-cell and T-cell epitope(s) from the spike, envelope and membrane proteins that could be used as promising vaccines against    SARS-CoV-2."

        "methods": [
            "2.1. Data retrieval<br/><br/>The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 was retrieved from the NCBI database under the accession number MN908947. Gene and protein sequences were acquired according to the annotation. In particular, the RBD region for the spike protein was referred to as the fragment from 347 to 520 amino acid (aa) (Lu et al, 2020).<br/><br/>2.2. B-cell epitope prediction<br/><br/>The online tool in IEDB (Immune-Epitope-Database And Analysis-Resource) was used for the analysis of the conserved regions of the candidate epitopes (Vita et al, 2015). Prediction of linear<br/><br/>B-cell epitopes was performed through Bepipred software (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJespersen_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rJespersen_et+al_2017_a\">Jespersen et al, 2017</a>). The antigenic sites were determined with Kolaskar method (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rChen_et+al_2007_a\">Chen et al, 2007</a>). The surface accessible epitopes were predicted by Emini tool (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAlmofti_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rAlmofti_et+al_2018_a\">Almofti et al, 2018</a>).<br/><br/>2.3. T-cell epitope prediction<br/><br/>The sequences of structural proteins were split into small fragments with a length of 9aa; their binding affinity with the 34 most prevalent HLA alleles (>1% in the Chinese population according to data obtained from the website for China Marrow Donor Program (CMDP)) was predicted using netMHCpan (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHoof_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rHoof_et+al_2009_a\">Hoof et al, 2009</a>) and our in-house prediction software iNeo-Pred, respectively. iNeo-Pred was trained on a large immune-peptide dataset, and achieved a better performance in predicting binding affinity of epitopes to specific HLA alleles. Only the epitopes predicted by both tools were selected. Next, for each epitope, a HLA score was calculated based on the frequencies of binding HLA alleles in Chinese population, which will be used as metrics to select better candidates for downstream analysis.<br/><br/>2.4. Vaccine peptide design<br/><br/>The vaccine peptides were designed by our in-house tool iNeo-Design. First, the selected B-cell epitopes and their adjacent T-cell epitopes were bridged to form candidate peptides with length no more than 30aa. Meanwhile, to facilitate the peptide synthesis, vaccine peptide sequences were optimized based on their hydrophobicity and acidity. To minimize the safety risk, peptides that contained toxicity potential, human homologous region (full-length matches and identity > 95%), or bioactive peptide were discarded.<br/><br/>Besides the vaccine peptides containing both B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes, iNeo-Design also utilized all predicted T-cell epitopes to generate T-cell epitopes-only vaccine peptides. For each vaccine candidate, the epitope counts and HLA score reflecting the population coverage were calculated. Vaccine candidates with the higher epitope counts and HLA score were considered to be preferable for the downstream analysis.<br/><br/>2.5. Structural analysis<br/><br/>The online server swiss-model was used to predict the 3D protein structures of viral proteins and<br/><br/>HLA molecules (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWaterhouse_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rWaterhouse_et+al_2018_a\">Waterhouse et al, 2018</a>). The online server PEP_FOLD was used to predict<br/><br/>T-cell epitopes\u2019 structures (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLamiable_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rLamiable_et+al_2016_a\">Lamiable et al, 2016</a>). To display the interaction between T-cell epitopes and HLA molecules, T-cell epitope models were docked to HLA molecules using<br/><br/>MDockPep (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cXu_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rXu_et+al_2018_a\">Xu et al, 2018</a>).

            "3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Prediction of B-cell epitopes During the immune response against viral infection, B-cell takes in viral epitopes to recognize viruses and activates defense responses. Recognition of B-cell epitopes depends on antigenicity, accessibility of surface and predictions of linear epitope (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFieser_et+al_1987_a\" href=\"#rFieser_et+al_1987_a\">Fieser et al, 1987</a>). A total of 61 B-cell epitopes were predicted, which seemed preferentially located within certain regions of each gene (Figure 1; Figure 2; Table S1). Only 19 epitopes were exposed on the surface of the virion and had a high antigenicity score, indicating their potentials in initiating immune response. Therefore, they were considered to be promising vaccine candidates against B-cells. Among the 19 epitopes, 17 were longer than14 residues and located in the spike protein that contained RBD and functioned in host cell binding (Table 1). The average Emini score for the 19 epitopes was 2.744, and the average for Kolaskar (antigenicity) score was 1.015. Two epitopes were located within the RBD region, while the one with the highest Kolaskar score (1.059), 1052-FPQSAPH-1058, was located at position 1052aa of the spike protein. 3.2. Prediction of T-cell epitopes The immune response of T-cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to B-cell where the antigen might easily escape the antibody memory response (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBlack_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rBlack_et+al_2010_a\">Black et al, 2010</a>). Moreover, the CD8+ T and CD4+ T-cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity. It is therefore important to design vaccines that can induce T-cell's immune response (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSesardic_1993_a\" href=\"#rSesardic_1993_a\">Sesardic, 1993</a>). A total of T-cell epitopes were predicted on the spike protein (378 epitopes), the membrane protein (90 epitopes) and the envelop protein (31 epitopes); 48 of the 378 epitopes for the spike protein were located in the RBD region (Figure 1; Table 2; Table S2). There is no preference in certain genes or regions for T-cell epitope generation; no biased distribution of T-cell epitopes among HLA types were observed either. Among all T-cell epitopes, the epitope 869-MIAQYTSAL-877 in the spike protein was predicted to be able to bind to 17 HLA alleles. Most of the HLA alleles included in the present study were covered by these vaccine candidates, which suggested a wide population coverage. In terms of the distribution of the predicted epitopes against different HLA haplotypes, no significant differences were observed among different HLA haplotypes (Table S3). There were 287, 208 and 195 epitopes predicted to be able to bind to HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C haplotypes, respectively. For the most popular five HLA types (HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-C*07:02, HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*46:01), the counts for epitopes with binding affinity were 51, 49, 115, and 58. 3.3. Multi-epitope vaccine design Based on the 19 B-cell epitopes and their 121 adjacent T-cell epitopes, 17 candidate vaccine peptides that contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes were generated by our in-house software iNeo-Design. Most of the 17 candidate vaccine peptides contained one B-cell epitopes, except for AVEQDKNTQEVFAQVKQIYKTPPIKDFGG, which involved two B-cell epitopes and eight T-cell epitopes, and AKNLNESLIDLQELGKYEQYIKWPWYIWKK, which contained two  B-cell FKNLREFVFKNIDGYFKIYSKHTPINLV had the largest count of T-cell epitopes, whereas the vaccine peptide SYGFQPTNGVGYQPYRVVVLSFELLHAPAT showed the highest HLA score, indicating their wide population coverage and promising efficacy.  epitopes and  T-cell epitopes. By comparison, the vaccine peptide In addition to the vaccine candidates involved both B-cell and T-cell epitopes, we also analysed the entire 499 core T-cell epitopes to generate another 102 vaccine peptides containing T-cell epitopes only. Based on both the epitope counts and HLA score, we eventually selected 13 T-cell epitopes-only vaccine peptides. Taken together, a total of 30 peptide vaccine candidates were designed (Table 3). 26 of them were from the spike protein, two from the membrane protein and two from the envelop protein. Five peptides were located in the RBD region, indicating they were likely to induce the production of neutralizing antibody. The 30 vaccine peptides covered all structural proteins that may induce immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in theory; and the multi-peptide strategy we applied would better fit the genetic variability of the human immune system and reduce the risk of pathogen\u2019s escape through mutation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSkwarczynski_2016_a\" href=\"#rSkwarczynski_2016_a\">Skwarczynski and Toth, 2016</a>). 3.4. Interaction of predicted peptides with HLA alleles To further inspect the binding stability of T-cell epitopes against HLA alleles, the T-cell epitopes involved in the above designed vaccine peptides were selected to conduct an interaction analysis. Figure 3 illustrated the docking results against the most popular HLA types for the two epitopes. from vaccines peptide 25 and 27 (Table 3; Table 4), which showed relatively higher HLA score. The MDockPep scores were between -148 ~ -136, indicating that the predicted crystal structures were stable. All epitopes were docked inside the catalytic pocket of the receptor protein. In particular, the epitope 1220-FIAGLIAIV-1228 from the spike protein possessed 2-5 stable hydrogen bonds with the HLA alleles; the epitope 4-FVSEETGTL-12 from the envelop protein possessed 4~5 stable hydrogen bonds (Table 4). Taken together, the epitopes included in our vaccine peptides can interact with the given HLA alleles by in silico prediction."
        ],
        "conclusions": [
            "Vaccine design using an in silico prediction method is highly appreciated as it selects specific epitopes in proteins than conventional methods. In the present study, this reverse vaccinology approach was adopted to identify surface-exposed peptides, instead of targeting the whole pathogen which is obviously less efficient and effective. Immunogenic regions of antigenic epitopes of all proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 were screened to identify potential vaccine candidates. As a result, 17 vaccine peptides involving both T-cell epitopes and B-cell epitopes as well as 13 vaccine peptides involving T-cell epitopes only were successfully designed. These multi-epitope vaccines provided excellent candidates for the development of vaccines against<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2. Various formulation of vaccine can be rapidly manufactured, such as peptide, DNA and mRNA. However in vitro and in vivo trials are required to achieve the effectiveness of these vaccine peptides."

            "A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, recently discovered in Wuhan, China, has caused over 74000 infection cases and 2000 deaths. Due to the rapidly growing cases and the unavailability of specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we performed an in silico approach based on the available virus genome to identify the antigenic B-cell epitopes and human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes. A total of 61 B-cell epitopes were initially identified, 19 of which with higher potential immunogenicity were used for vaccine design. 499 T-cell epitopes were predicted that showed affinity with the 34 most popular HLA alleles in Chinese population. Based on these epitopes, 30 vaccine candidates were designed and inspected against safety risks, including potential toxicity, human homologous, pharmaceutical peptides and bioactive peptides. Majority of vaccine peptides contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes, which may interact with the most prevalent HLA alleles accounting for ~99% of Chinese population. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. In conclusion, these putative antigenic peptides may elicit the resistance response to the viral infection. In vitro and in vivo experiments are required to validate the effectiveness of these peptide vaccine."

In this context, a safe and efficacious vaccine is urgently required.

            "Complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has finished and paved the way for the vaccine development (Chen et al.). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes the spike protein, the membrane protein, the envelope protein, the nucleocapsid protein and a few replication and transcription-related enzymes.

The 4% nucleotide difference of the virus isolated from Rhinolophus to that from human suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutates rapidly to achieve the host conversion (Jiayuan Chen, 2020). Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses its receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein to bind to the host\u2019s angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Chen et al.; Dong et al, 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTian_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rTian_et+al_2020_a\">Tian et al, 2020</a>; Zhou et al, 2020).
