        "abstract": "To control the spread of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment is a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the diagnostic gold standard but it is time consuming with significant false negative results. Fast and accurate diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we aimed to develop a deep learning method that could extract COVID-19\u2019s graphical features in order to provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. Methods:We collected 1,119 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. We modified the Inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. Results: The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images that first two nucleic acid test results were negative, 46 were predicted as COVID-19 positive by the algorithm, with the accuracy of 85.2%. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the proof-of-principle for using artificial intelligence to extract radiological features for timely and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.

            "The outbreak of atypical and person-to-person transmissible pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2, also known as 2019-nCov) has caused a global alarm. There have been more than 100,000 confirmed cases of the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) in the world, as of May 8, 2020. According to the WHO, 16-21% of people with the virus in China have become severely ill with a 2-3% mortality rate. With the most recent estimated viral reproduction number (R0), the average number of other people that an infected individual will transmit the virus to in a completely non-immune population, stands at about 3.77 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] , indicating that a rapid spread of the disease is imminent. Therefore, it is crucial to identify infected individuals as early as possible for quarantine and treatment procedures. The diagnosis of COVID-19 relies on the following criteria: clinical symptoms, epidemiological history and positive CT images, as well as positive pathogenic testing. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspna, and pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. However, these symptoms are nonspecific, as there are isolated cases where, for example, in an asymptomatic infected family a chest CT scan revealed pneumonia and the pathogenic test for the virus came back positive. Once someone is identified as a PUI (person under investigation), lower respiratory specimens, such as bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirate or sputum, will be collected for pathogenic testing. This laboratory technology is based on real-time RT-PCR and sequencing of nucleic acid from the virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Since the beginning of the outbreak, the efficiency of nucleic acid testing has been dependent on several rate-limiting factors, including availability and quantity of the testing kits in the affected area. More importantly, the quality, stability and reproducibility of the detection kits are questionable. The impact of methodology, disease stages, specimen collection methods, nucleic acid extraction methods, and the amplification system are all determinant factors for the accuracy of test results. Conservative estimates of the detection rate of nucleic acid are low (between 30-50%) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], and tests need to be repeated several times in many cases before they can be confirmed.<br/><br/>Radiological imaging is also a major diagnostic tool for COVID-19. The majority of COVID-19 cases have similar features on CT images including ground-glass opacities in the early stage and pulmonary consolidation in the late stage. There is also sometimes a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Although typical CT images may help early screening of suspected cases, the images of various viral pneumonias are similar and they overlap with other infectious and inflammatory lung diseases. Therefore, it is difficult for radiologists to distinguish COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias.<br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence involving medical imaging deep-learning systems has been developed in image feature extraction, including shape and spatial relation features. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been proven in feature extraction and learning. CNN was used to enhance low-light images from high-speed video endoscopy with the limited training data being just 55 videos [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Also, CNN has been applied to identify the nature of pulmonary nodules via CT images, the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia via chest X-ray images, automated precising and labeling of polyps during colonoscopic videos, cystoscopic image recognition extraction from videos [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].<br/><br/>There are a number of features for identifying viral pathogens on the basis of imaging patterns, which are associated with their specific pathogenesis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. The hallmarks of COVID-19 are bilateral distribution of patchy shadows and ground glass opacity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Based on this, we believed that CNN might help us identify unique features that might be difficult for visual recognition.<br/><br/>Hence, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a deep learning algorithm using CT images to screen for COVID-19. To test this notion, we retrospectively enrolled 1,119 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with previously diagnosed typical viral pneumonia. Our results reported below demonstrate the proof-of-principle using the deep learning method to extract radiological graphical features for COVID-19 diagnosis."

            "<strong>Methods and Materials</strong><br/><br/>Retrospective collection of datasets. We retrospectively collected CT images from 259 patients, in which the cohort includes 180 cases of typical viral pneumonia and the other 79 cases from three hospitals with confirmed nucleic acid testing of SARS-COV-2. In addition, we enrolled additional 15 COVID cases, in which first two nucleic acid tests were negative at initial diagnoses. Hospitals providing the images were Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University First Hospital and Xi\u2019an No.8 Hospital of Xi\u2019an Medical College. All CT images were de-identified before sending for analysis. This study is in compliance with the Institutional Review Board of each participating institutes. Informed consent was exempted by the IRB because of the retrospective nature of this study. Delineation of ROIs We sketched the region of interest (ROI) on the CT images based on the features of pneumonia, such as ground-glass opacity, mosaic sign and interlobular septal thickening. For a ROI, it is sized approximately from 395*223 to 636*533 pixels. Overview of the proposed architecture Our systematic pipeline for the prediction architecture is depicted in Figure 1. The architecture consists of three main processes. 1) Extraction of ROI images and randomly selection of ROIs; 2) Training of the CNN model to extract features; 3) Classification model training of fully connected network and prediction of multiple classifiers. We built a transfer learning neural network based on the Inception network. The entire neural network can be roughly divided into two parts: the first part used a pre-trained inception network to convert image data into one-dimensional feature vectors, and the second part used a fully connected network and the main role is for classification prediction. We randomly selected 2-3 ROI images from each case to form a training dataset. The number of various types of pictures in the training set is equal, with a total number of 320. The remaining CT pictures of each case were used for internal validation. The model training was iterated 15,000 times with a step size of 0.01.<br/><br/>Extraction of ROI images Based on the signs of characteristic of pneumonia, ROI images were defined inflammatory lesions and extracted by our computer vision (CV) model following the steps. 1) Convert the image to grayscale. 2) Binarize grayscale. Because using the OSTU\u2019s method directly may cause the threshold selection failure in the case of multi-peaks, the selection of the binarization threshold in this paper was based on the statistics of all pixel frequency histograms of the gray color values Vmin (80) and Vmax (200). The minimum frequency in the selection interval is threshold, and the interval of frequency statistics is five. 3) Background area filling. Using the flood filling method to expand the image by 1 black pixel, and fill the black pixels near the border with white. 4) Reverse color, find all the contour areas of the image, and keep the two largest contour areas as the two lung areas. 5) Take the smallest bounding rectangle of the lung area as the ROI frame and crop the original image to obtain the ROI images. Then we randomly selected delineated ROIs for classification model building.<br/><br/>Feature extraction using transfer learning We modified the typical Inception network, and fine-tuned the modified Inception (M-Inception) model with pre-trained weights. During the training phase, the original Inception part was not trained, and we only trained the modified part. The architecture of M-Inception is shown in Table 1. The difference between Inception and M-Inception in classification lies in the last fully-connected layers. We reduced the dimension of features before it was sent to the final classification layer. The training dataset made up of all those patches aforementioned. The Inception network is shown in Table1. Prediction. After generating the features, the final step was to classify the pneumonia based on those features. Ensembling of classifiers was used to improve the classification accuracy. In this study, we adopted end-to-end learning to make the model convergence. Performance evaluation metrics. We compared the classification performance using Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Area Under Curve (AUC), Positive predictive value (PPV), Negative predictive value (NPV), F1 score and Youden Index. TP and TN represent the number of true positive or true negative samples. FP and FN mean the number of false positive or false negative samples. Sensitivity measures the ratio of positives that are correctly discriminated. Specificity measures the ratio of negatives that are correctly discriminated. AUC is an index to measure the performance of the classifier. NPV was used to evaluate the algorithm for screening, and PPV was the probability of getting a disease when the diagnostic index is positive. Youden Index was the determining exponent of the optimal bound. F1 score was a measure of the accuracy of a binary model. Additionally, performance was evaluated with F-measure (F1) to compare the similarity and diversity of performance. Kappa value measures the agreement between the CNN model prediction and the clinical report.<br/><br/>Algorithm development."

            "In order to develop a deep learning algorithm for the identification of viral pneumonia images, we initially enrolled 259 patients, in which the cohort includes 180 cases of typical viral pneumonia that were diagnosed previously before the COVID-19 outbreak. These patients are termed COVID-19 negative in the cohort. The other 79 cases were from the three hospitals with confirmed nucleic acid testing of SARS-COV-2, therefore termed COVID-19 positive. Two radiologists were asked to review the images and sketched 1,065 representative images (740 for COVID-19 negative and 325 for COVID-19 positive) for analysis (Figure 2 is shown as an example). These images were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set.

        "Introduction": [
            "The outbreak of atypical and person-to-person transmissible pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2, also known as 2019-nCov) has caused a global alarm. There have been more than 100,000 confirmed cases of the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) in the world, as of May 8, 2020. According to the WHO, 16-21% of people with the virus in China have become severely ill with a 2-3% mortality rate. With the most recent estimated viral reproduction number (R0), the average number of other people that an infected individual will transmit the virus to in a completely non-immune population, stands at about 3.77 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] , indicating that a rapid spread of the disease is imminent. Therefore, it is crucial to identify infected individuals as early as possible for quarantine and treatment procedures. The diagnosis of COVID-19 relies on the following criteria: clinical symptoms, epidemiological history and positive CT images, as well as positive pathogenic testing. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspna, and pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. However, these symptoms are nonspecific, as there are isolated cases where, for example, in an asymptomatic infected family a chest CT scan revealed pneumonia and the pathogenic test for the virus came back positive. Once someone is identified as a PUI (person under investigation), lower respiratory specimens, such as bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirate or sputum, will be collected for pathogenic testing. This laboratory technology is based on real-time RT-PCR and sequencing of nucleic acid from the virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Since the beginning of the outbreak, the efficiency of nucleic acid testing has been dependent on several rate-limiting factors, including availability and quantity of the testing kits in the affected area. More importantly, the quality, stability and reproducibility of the detection kits are questionable. The impact of methodology, disease stages, specimen collection methods, nucleic acid extraction methods, and the amplification system are all determinant factors for the accuracy of test results. Conservative estimates of the detection rate of nucleic acid are low (between 30-50%) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], and tests need to be repeated several times in many cases before they can be confirmed.",
            "Radiological imaging is also a major diagnostic tool for COVID-19. The majority of COVID-19 cases have similar features on CT images including ground-glass opacities in the early stage and pulmonary consolidation in the late stage. There is also sometimes a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Although typical CT images may help early screening of suspected cases, the images of various viral pneumonias are similar and they overlap with other infectious and inflammatory lung diseases. Therefore, it is difficult for radiologists to distinguish COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias.",
            "Artificial Intelligence involving medical imaging deep-learning systems has been developed in image feature extraction, including shape and spatial relation features. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been proven in feature extraction and learning. CNN was used to enhance low-light images from high-speed video endoscopy with the limited training data being just 55 videos [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Also, CNN has been applied to identify the nature of pulmonary nodules via CT images, the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia via chest X-ray images, automated precising and labeling of polyps during colonoscopic videos, cystoscopic image recognition extraction from videos [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "There are a number of features for identifying viral pathogens on the basis of imaging patterns, which are associated with their specific pathogenesis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. The hallmarks of COVID-19 are bilateral distribution of patchy shadows and ground glass opacity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Based on this, we believed that CNN might help us identify unique features that might be difficult for visual recognition.",
            "Hence, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a deep learning algorithm using CT images to screen for COVID-19. To test this notion, we retrospectively enrolled 1,119 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with previously diagnosed typical viral pneumonia. Our results reported below demonstrate the proof-of-principle using the deep learning method to extract radiological graphical features for COVID-19 diagnosis."

            "Retrospective collection of datasets. We retrospectively collected CT images from 259 patients, in which the cohort includes 180 cases of typical viral pneumonia and the other 79 cases from three hospitals with confirmed nucleic acid testing of SARS-COV-2. In addition, we enrolled additional 15 COVID cases, in which first two nucleic acid tests were negative at initial diagnoses. Hospitals providing the images were Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University First Hospital and Xi\u2019an No.8 Hospital of Xi\u2019an Medical College. All CT images were de-identified before sending for analysis. This study is in compliance with the Institutional Review Board of each participating institutes. Informed consent was exempted by the IRB because of the retrospective nature of this study. Delineation of ROIs We sketched the region of interest (ROI) on the CT images based on the features of pneumonia, such as ground-glass opacity, mosaic sign and interlobular septal thickening. For a ROI, it is sized approximately from 395*223 to 636*533 pixels. Overview of the proposed architecture Our systematic pipeline for the prediction architecture is depicted in Figure 1. The architecture consists of three main processes. 1) Extraction of ROI images and randomly selection of ROIs; 2) Training of the CNN model to extract features; 3) Classification model training of fully connected network and prediction of multiple classifiers. We built a transfer learning neural network based on the Inception network. The entire neural network can be roughly divided into two parts: the first part used a pre-trained inception network to convert image data into one-dimensional feature vectors, and the second part used a fully connected network and the main role is for classification prediction. We randomly selected 2-3 ROI images from each case to form a training dataset. The number of various types of pictures in the training set is equal, with a total number of 320. The remaining CT pictures of each case were used for internal validation. The model training was iterated 15,000 times with a step size of 0.01.",
            "Extraction of ROI images Based on the signs of characteristic of pneumonia, ROI images were defined inflammatory lesions and extracted by our computer vision (CV) model following the steps. 1) Convert the image to grayscale. 2) Binarize grayscale. Because using the OSTU\u2019s method directly may cause the threshold selection failure in the case of multi-peaks, the selection of the binarization threshold in this paper was based on the statistics of all pixel frequency histograms of the gray color values Vmin (80) and Vmax (200). The minimum frequency in the selection interval is threshold, and the interval of frequency statistics is five. 3) Background area filling. Using the flood filling method to expand the image by 1 black pixel, and fill the black pixels near the border with white. 4) Reverse color, find all the contour areas of the image, and keep the two largest contour areas as the two lung areas. 5) Take the smallest bounding rectangle of the lung area as the ROI frame and crop the original image to obtain the ROI images. Then we randomly selected delineated ROIs for classification model building.",
            "Feature extraction using transfer learning We modified the typical Inception network, and fine-tuned the modified Inception (M-Inception) model with pre-trained weights. During the training phase, the original Inception part was not trained, and we only trained the modified part. The architecture of M-Inception is shown in Table 1. The difference between Inception and M-Inception in classification lies in the last fully-connected layers. We reduced the dimension of features before it was sent to the final classification layer. The training dataset made up of all those patches aforementioned. The Inception network is shown in Table1. Prediction. After generating the features, the final step was to classify the pneumonia based on those features. Ensembling of classifiers was used to improve the classification accuracy. In this study, we adopted end-to-end learning to make the model convergence. Performance evaluation metrics. We compared the classification performance using Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Area Under Curve (AUC), Positive predictive value (PPV), Negative predictive value (NPV), F1 score and Youden Index. TP and TN represent the number of true positive or true negative samples. FP and FN mean the number of false positive or false negative samples. Sensitivity measures the ratio of positives that are correctly discriminated. Specificity measures the ratio of negatives that are correctly discriminated. AUC is an index to measure the performance of the classifier. NPV was used to evaluate the algorithm for screening, and PPV was the probability of getting a disease when the diagnostic index is positive. Youden Index was the determining exponent of the optimal bound. F1 score was a measure of the accuracy of a binary model. Additionally, performance was evaluated with F-measure (F1) to compare the similarity and diversity of performance. Kappa value measures the agreement between the CNN model prediction and the clinical report.",
