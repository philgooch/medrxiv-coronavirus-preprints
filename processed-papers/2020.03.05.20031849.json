        "abstract": "Background: A novel coronavirus named as \"SARS-CoV-2\" has spread widely in many countries since December 2019, especially in China. This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model.\nMethods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: &lt;= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: &gt;= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: &lt;= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: &gt;= 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR). \nResults: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups (\u03c72 = 4.99 \u00d7 10-6, P &gt; 0.999), and five age groups (\u03c72 = 4.85 \u00d7 10-6, P &gt; 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons).\nConclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people.",

The patients may be related to have contacted with Huanan<br/><br/>Seafood Wholesale Market[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], and the virus can continuously transmit from person-to-person with basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 3.9)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Another research estimated that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 (95% CI, 2.47 to 2.86)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].<br/><br/>Age-related transmissibility of COVID-19 has become a public health concern. The reported cases at the early stage (before 2 January 2020) of the transmission were higher than 18 years old and mainly were on 25-64 years old[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].
