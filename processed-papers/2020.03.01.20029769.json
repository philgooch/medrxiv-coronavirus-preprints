        "abstract": "Abstract. \nBackground: \nThe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific medication. The purpose of this study is to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring.\nMethods: Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed.\nResults: A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% of female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), coughing (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement or interstitial pneumonia evidenced by CT imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline IL-6 was significantly increased in severe type which is closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patient whose level of IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to the progression of pneumonia. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a biomarker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients.\nConclusion: On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the high level of IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease progression. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19.",

            "Data collection. COVID-19 was diagnosed in accordance with the WHO interim guidance. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid on high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included in this study, while disease diagnosed based on clinical presentation and imaging findings, but not on SARS-CoV-2 detection, were excluded. The severity of COVID-19 is classified according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Pneumonia Infected by Novel Coronavirus (trial Fifth Edition) of the Health and Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Severe case is defined when any of the following criteria is met: 1. shortness of breath, RR \u2265 30 times / min; 2. the oxygen saturation is less than 93% in resting state; 3. arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / oxygen concentration (FiO2) \u2264 300mmHg (l mmHg=0.133kPa). If the pulmonary lesion progressed more than 50% within 24 to 48 hours as evidenced by radiologic assessment, clinical management should be complied with the severe type. We collected data of 69 patients with severe type COVID-19 between January 21 and February 16, 2020 hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. A retrospective study on the clinical characteristics and laboratory examination was conducted. 11 nonsevere COVID-19 patients were included for comparison. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Written consent was obtained from patients before the enrollment."

        "discussion": [
            "This study shows that most of the severe cases of COVID-19 have the initial symptoms of fever, coughing, shortness of breath and fatigue, while diarrhea is not common. Compared with the nonsevere cases, the imaging findings mainly involve bilateral and interstitial pulmonary changes. In patients with severe disease, more intensive and supportive treatment, including glucocorticoid, human immunoglobulin, interferon-\u03b1, antibiotics, antiviral therapy (Oseltamivir and Abidol) and oxygen therapy, was given and relieved symptoms were observed in most cases. The time from initial symptoms to pneumonia in severe COVID-19 patients is shorter, the median recovery time is longer, and the onset of severe type is more rapid than the nonsevere type.<br/><br/>Previous studies have suggested that lymphocytopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm are associated with the severity of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Cytokines are signaling peptides, proteins, or glycoproteins that are secreted by many cell types, including immune, epithelial, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells. Cytokines allow context-dependent communication within the body[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. If the interactions that lead to cytokine production are destabilized, a \"cytokine storm\" can result, producing unbridled inflammation within tissues and key organs.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] Cytokine storms are associated with sepsis and septic shock, influenza, acute respiratory distress, and toxic response to medication and so on[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a have the highest degree of variability in response to uncertain initial conditions, exogenous effects, and parameter estimates. They have been implicated in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and the H5N1 avian influenza infections firstly recognized in 19877, 15, 16. Similarly, recent studies on COVID-19 patients have also reported a decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count and an increase in serum inflammatory cytokine levels 2, 11. Cytokine storms, that is, inflammatory storms which can quickly cause single or multiple organ failure and ultimately can be life-threatening, are considered to be an important cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection can rapidly activate pathogenic T cells and produce granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-6. GM-CSF will further activate CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes and produce more IL-6 and other inflammatory factors, resulting in a cytokine storm that causes severe immune damage to the lungs and other organs[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Results of this study suggest that compared with the common type, the changes in immunological parameters and cytokine level in severe disease are inconspicuous. There was only mild variation \u03b3 in IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-a, IFN- level before and after treatment, all of which fluctuated within the normal range. Elevated CRP, ferritin, IL-6 and LDH are associated with longer treatment period and more intensive treatment, which included glucocorticoids, human immunoglobulin, stronger antibiotics, high flow oxygen inhalation or ventilator. Collectively, it showed that the abovementioned parameters were closely related to disease severity. Further analysis showed that the changes in IL-6 were closely related to the disease. In this study, CRP, ferritin and IL-6, LDH decreased significantly after cure, while as the disease progressed, IL-6 was further increased and pulmonary lesions deteriorate as evidenced by CT scan, suggesting that IL-6 may be a valuable candidate for disease monitoring. Among the cases included, only 1 severe case showed low IL-6 level as disease progressed. In this case, to our interest, the lung progression was caused by bacterial infection, but not viral infection, which might suggest the specificity of IL-6 in COVID-19. IL-6 is synthesized by a variety of cells in the lung parenchyma, including the alveolar macrophages, type II pneumocytes, T lymphocytes, and lung fibroblasts. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine important in regulating immunologic and inflammatory responses. IL-6 has been further implicated in regulating immune response, autoimmune mechanisms, and acute phase responses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. IL-6 being an acute phase inflammatory cytokine suggests that measurement of circulating IL-6 can reflect the inflammatory state of the lung[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. This is supported by the often observed increase of IL-6 in acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in patients with acute complications of lung transplantation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Our patients with COVID-19 demonstrated higher circulating level of IL-6 during and immediately after diagnosis, a finding that supports a shared mechanism of cytokine-mediated lung injury caused by infectious agents. However the mechanism for IL-6 involvement in viral pneumonitis deserves further investigation. Siltuximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeted against IL-6 and its receptor (IL6R)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Both siltuximab and tocilizumab have been used to treat cytokine release syndrome following CAR-gaT therapy. Since we have found that IL-6 may be related to COVID-19 severity, we suggest that targeting IL-6 may ameliorate cytokine storm-related symptoms in severe COVID-19 cases 22, 23. In conclusion, severe COVID-19 patients require more intensive treatment, and the prognosis is relatively poor. IL-6 is positively correlated with disease severity, since it decreases with the remission and increases with the aggravation of the disease. Therefore, IL-6 may be an ideal marker of the disease. However, the relationship between IL-6 and the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains elusive. IL-6 and IL6R antibodies may be effective in treating inflammatory cytokine storm during disease progression."

        "introduction": [
            "In early December, 2019, the first case of pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was highly contagious and rapidly spread nationwide and worldwide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. A new \u03b2-coronavirus was identified by high-throughput sequencing and it is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which shared phylogenetic similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that caused the outbreak of SARS in 20031, 4, 5. Disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was then officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO). Analysis of the epidemiological pattern curve of COVID-19 showed that the overall epidemic pattern was aggregation outbreak. Most cases were mild and curable, and the overall crude mortality was low[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. However, patients with severe disease showed respiratory dysfunction and high mortality rate[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. By February 16, 2020, a total number of 57934 cases were reported in mainland China, including 10644 severe cases. As the outbreak area of COVID-19, the total number of confirmed cases in Hubei is 49847, with 9797 (19.6%) severe cases and an overall mortality rate of 3.4%. The disease incidence and mortality rate of severe COVID-19 in Hubei is relatively high as compared with other areas in China.",
            "At present, the monitoring of severe cases mainly rely on the observation of clinical manifestation, since there is no effective marker nor medication[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Previous studies have suggested that lymphocytopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm are typical abnormalies in infections caused by highly pathogenic coronavirus, such as SARS and MERS, and are considered disease severity related[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Similarly, recent studies on COVID-19 patients have reported a decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count and an increase in serum inflammatory cytokines[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. A better understanding of the clinical features of COVID-19 is urgently needed in order to screen out reliable markers for inflammation monitoring and effective medication. According to previous relevant literature on viral pneumonia and the current clinical treatment experience on severe type of COVID-19, it is suggested that the storm of inflammatory factors may be the main reason for rapid disease progression and poor treatment response[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In this study by collecting data of laboratory confirmed severe cases, we tried to analyze the clinical features and inflammatory markers in patients with severe type COVID-19 in Wuhan City to explore biomarkers for disease monitoring and treatment screening."

Another 11 nonsevere cases were also enrolled (Table 1).",
            "The most common CT findings in severe cases upon admission are bilateral patchy shadow (60.87%) and interstitial pneumonia (27.54%), while the common type mainly manifested as focal ground glass opacity and patchy shadow (54.5%) (Table 2). Baseline neutrocytopenia, lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 13.04%, 79.71% and 24.64% of the severe type patients upon admission, respectively (Table 2) and lymphocyte count was significantly less than the nonsevere cases (Figure 1. A). Creatine kinase increased in 14.49% of the cases, while increased level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase was more common and both was detected in 37.68% of the cases (Table 2). Baseline inflammatory level, PCT change is not obvious. Most patients showed increased level of D-dimer and ESR, and significantly increased level of LDH, CRP and ferittin (Figure 1. B). 7 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and 1 got septic shock (Table3). 89.86% of the severe type patients was given antibiotics, 63.77% was given antiviral therapy (20.29% with Oseltamivir, 52.17% with Arbidol), 42.03% was given glucocorticoids, 50.72% was given human immunoglobulin and 7.25% was given Klitsch (Table 3). Most of the severe type patients needed oxygen therapy, 27.54% needed high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilator therapy and invasive ventilator therapy (Table 3). For clinical outcome of the enrolled patients with severe disease, 53.62% were cured, 3 patients (4.35%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit, 46.38% were still hospitalized, and there was no death case (Table 3).

C). The baseline level of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF- \u03b1 and IFN- \u03b3 was within normal range, while IL-10 was slightly increased and IL-6 was increased significantly in severe cases than the nonsevere cases (Figure 1. D). The baseline high IL-6 level was positively correlated with bilateral and interstitial pulmonary involvement (r=0.453, P=0.001). Meanwhile, the baseline IL-6 levels was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization (r=0.521,P=0.00) ( Figure 3. A), and it is also significantly related to the increase of CRP (r=0.781, P=0.001), LDH (r=0.749, P=0.001), ferritin (r=0.606, P=0.001) and D-dimer (r=0.679, P=0.001) (Figure 3. B-E). The increase of baseline IL-6 suggested that it was positively correlated with the severity of COVID-19. We found the tendency showing that the lower the IL-6 level, the shorter the time lapse from diagnosis to cure (r=0.049, P=0.763), whereas the higher the IL-6 level, the shorter the time lapse from symptom onset to pneumonia diagnosis (r= - 0.116, P=0.345), although there is no significant difference. The higher level of IL-6 related to glucocorticords (r=0.301, P=0.001), human immunoglobulin (r=0.147, P=0.118), high flow oxygen inhalation (r=0.251, P=0.007), ventilator therapy (r=0.223, P=0.017).",

Disease of the other 4 patients progressed continuously. Among them, 3 patients showed persistent increase of IL-6 (Figure 4. B), while the change in IL-6 in 1 patient was not obvious. For this patient, there was an increase in PCT level, and the progression of lung disease was confirmed as bacterial, but not viral pneumonia (Figure 4. C). Finally, as shown in Figure 5, with the remission of disease, IL-6 decreased significantly, D-dimer and CRP, LDH also decreased significantly, and all of them were associated with the resolution of clinical manifestation and CT images."

            "In early December, 2019, the first case of pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was highly contagious and rapidly spread nationwide and worldwide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",
            "As the outbreak area of COVID-19, the total number of confirmed cases in Hubei is 49847, with 9797 (19.6%) severe cases and an overall mortality rate of 3.4%.",
            "The disease incidence and mortality rate of severe COVID-19 in Hubei is relatively high as compared with other areas in China.",
            "In this study by collecting data of laboratory confirmed severe cases, the authors tried to analyze the clinical features and inflammatory markers in patients with severe type COVID-19 in Wuhan City to explore biomarkers for disease monitoring and treatment screening"
