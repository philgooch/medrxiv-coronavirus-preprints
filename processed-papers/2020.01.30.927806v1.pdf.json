        "abstract": "2 Since December 2019, a newly identified coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus, 3 2019-nCov) is causing outbreak of pneumonia in one of largest cities, Wuhan, in 4 Hubei province of China and has draw significant public health attention. The same as 5 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 2019-nCov enters into 6 host cells via cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). In order to 7 dissect the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion and explore a potential 8 route of the 2019-nCov infection in digestive system infection, 4 datasets with 9 single-cell transcriptomes of lung, esophagus, gastric, ileum and colon were analyzed. The data showed that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in the lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. These results indicated along with respiratory systems, digestive system is a potential routes for 2019-nCov infection. In conclusion, this study has provided the bioinformatics evidence of the potential route for infection of 2019-nCov in digestive system along with respiratory tract and may have significant impact for our healthy policy setting regards to prevention of 2019-nCoV infection. Introduction At the end of 2019, a rising number of pneumonia patients with unknown pathogen has been emerging in one of largest cities of China,Wuhan, and quickly spread throughout whole country[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. A novel coronavirus was then isolated from the human airway epithelial cells and was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The complete genome sequences has reveled that 2019-nCoV sharing 86.9% nucleotide sequence identity to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus detected in bats (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1). This suggested that 2019-nCoV is the species of SARS related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) by pairwise protein sequence analysis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. As for the clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV infection, fever and cough are most common symptoms at onset[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. In addition, it frequently induces severe enteric",

            "Annotation of cell types<br/><br/>The gastrointestinal system is composed of esophagus, stomach, ileum, colon and cecum. In this study, 4 datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of esophagus, gastric, ileum and colon were analyzed, along with lung (Additional file). Based on Cell<br/><br/>Ranger output, the gene expression count matrices were used to present sequential clustering of cells according to different organs or particular clusters. The cell type identity in each cluster was annotated by the expression of the known cell type markers.<br/><br/>In the esophagus, 14 cell types were identified through 87,947 cells. Over 90% cells fall into four major epithelial cell types: upper, stratified, suprabasal, and dividing cells of the suprabasal layer (Fig. 1A). The additional cells from the basal layer of epithelia clustered more closely to the gland duct and mucous secreting cells. Lymph vessel and endothelial cells are associated with vessel tissues. Immune cells in the esophagus include T cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and mast cells.<br/><br/>A total of 29,678 cells and 10 cell types were identified in the stomach after quality control with a high proportion of gastric epithelial cells, including antral basal gland mucous cells (GMCs), pit mucous cells (PMCs), chief cells and enteroendocrine cells (Fig. 1B). The non-epithelial cell lineages were composed of T cells, B cells, myeloid cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells.<br/><br/>After quality controls, 50,286 cells and 10 cell types were identified in the ileum (Fig.<br/><br/>1C). The detected cell types included epithelia, endothelial, fibroblast and enteroendocrine cells. The identified immune cell types were myeloid, CD4+T, CD8+T and natural killer T (NKT) cells, along with plasma and B cells. Among<br/><br/>11,218 epithelial cells, 5 cell types were identified, namely, absorptive enterocytes, progenitor absorptive, goblet, Paneth and undifferentiated cells (Fig. 1D).<br/><br/>All the 47,442 cells from the colon were annotated after quality controls (Fig. 1E).<br/><br/>Absorptive and secretory clusters were identified in epithelial cells. The absorptive clusters included further sub-clusters for transit amplifying (TA) cells (TA 1, TA 2), immature enterocytes, and enterocytes. The secretory clusters included sub-clusters for progenitor cells (secretory TA, immature goblet) and for mature cells (goblet, and enteroendocrine). Ganglion cells and cycling TA cells were also identified in the final<br/><br/>Cell type-specific ACE2 expression<br/><br/>With regard to stomach, the expression of ACE2 is relatively low in all the clusters (Fig. 2B, C). The selected cell type-specific marker genes were used to identify each cluster in the stomach (Fig. 2C). MUC6 and TIFF1 were highly expressed in all the clusters. PGA4 was used to identify chief cells, along with CHGB for enteroendocrine cells, CD34 for endothelial cells, CD79A for B cells, CD8A and PRF1 for T cells, VCAN and COL1A1 for fibrosus blast and CLEC10A for myeloid cells.<br/><br/>As for esophagus, ACE2 was highly expressed in upper and stratified epithelial cells (Fig. 3B, C). The glands also have a low expression of ACE2 (Fig. 3C). The selected cell type-specific marker genes were used to identify each cluster in the esophagus (Fig. 3C). ECM1 was highly expressed in upper epithelial cells. KRT4 and 5 were mainly found in stratified epithelial cells. KI67 was used to identify dividing epithelial cells, with MUC5B and KRT23 for glands, COL1A1 and DCN for stroma cells, VWF and PECAM1 for lymph vessel and endothelial cells. TPSB2, FCN1, CD79A, GNLY, CD27 and CD3E were used for immune cells, such as myeloid, DC, B, T and mast cells.<br/><br/>In the epithelial cells of the ileum, ACE2 was highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes and less expressed in progenitor absorptive cells, which was similar to those in the colon (Fig. 4B, C). The selected cell type-specific marker genes were also used to identify the epithelial cells of the ileum (Fig. 4C). SEC2A5 was found mainly in the absorptive enterocytes and progenitor absorptive cells. CD24 was found in all epithelial cells except absorptive enterocytes. MII67 and AMACR were highly expressed in undifferentiated and Paneth cells, respectively. BCAS1 was used to identify undifferentiated cells, with AMACR for Paneth.<br/><br/>In the colon, ACE2 was mainly found in enterocytes and less expressed in immature enterocytes (Fig. 5B, C). The selected cell type-specific marker genes were used to identify each cluster in the colon (Fig. 5C). AQPB was mainly found in enterocytes and immature enterocytes. Additionally, ZG16 and ITLN1 was highly expressed in goblet and immature goblet. The expression of APOE was in TA2 and secretory TA.<br/><br/>CD27 and TPH1 were used to identify enteroendocrine, with SPC25 for cycling TA.<br/><br/>After initial quality controls, 57,020 cells and 25 cell types were identified in the lung (Fig. 6A). The detected cell types included ciliated, alveolar type 1 (AT1) and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, along with fibroblast, muscle, and endothelial cells. The identified immune cell types were T, B and NK cells, along with macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells (DC). ACE2 was mainly expressed in AT2 cells and could also be found in AT1 and fibroblast cells (Fig. 6B).<br/><br/>Among all the ACE2-expressing cells in normal digestive system and lung, the expression of ACE2 was more in ileum and colon than that in the lung and esophagus (Fig. 6C)."

            "The coronaviruses is the common infection source of upper respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous system in humans and other mammals[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, two betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV and<br/><br/>MERS-CoV, caused persistent public panics and became the most significant public health events[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. In December 2019, a novel identified coronavirus (2019-nCov) induced an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China with arising number of infected patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Till now, its infection routes and digestive system infection are still unclear. In this study, we found the high expressions of ACE2, the cell entry receptor of 2019-nCov, in the lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, indicating that not only respiratory system but also digestive system are potential routes of infection. In addition, the enteric symptoms of 2019-nCov may be associated with the invaded<br/><br/>ACE2-expressing enterocytes.<br/><br/>Generally, many respiratory pathogens, such as influenza, SARS-CoV and<br/><br/>SARSr-CoV, cause enteric symptoms, so is 2019-nCov[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. As a classic respiratory coronavirus, SARS often causes enteric symptoms along with respiratory symptoms.<br/><br/>Moreover, transmission with stool is also a neglected risk for SARS[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. During the infection of SARS and highly pathogenic strains of influenza, their enteric symptoms are associated with the increased permeability to intestinal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)<br/><br/>and bacterial transmigration through gastrointestinal wall[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. However, the mechanism of 2019-nCov-induced enteric symptom is still unknown.<br/><br/>A recent study revealed that similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ACE2 was the cell entry receptor for 2019-nCov[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Previously, ACE2 was isolated from<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-permissive Vero E6 cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. It could interact with a defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) of CTD1 in SARS-CoV and facilitate efficient cross-species infection and person-to-person transmission[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. The \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d<br/><br/>transition of CTD1 allows ACE2 binding by regulating the relationship among CTD1, CTD2, S1-ACE2 complex and S2 subunit[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. With regard to human HeLa cells, expressing ACE2 from human, civet, and Chinese horseshoe bat can help many kinds of SARSr-CoV, including 2019-nCov, to enter into the cells, indicating the important role of ACE2 in cellular entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Therapeutically, anti-ACE2 antibody can block viral replication on Vero E6 cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>].<br/><br/>By analyzing the expression of ACE2 in normal human gastrointestinal system and lung, we found high expression of ACE2 in the lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. Similar to the previous study, ACE2 was more expressed in AT2 cells and less expressed in AT1 cells in normal lung[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. In lung alveoli, AT1 epithelial cells are responsible for gas exchange and AT2 cells are in charge of surfactant biosynthesis and self-renewing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. In SARS-CoV infection, AT2 is the major infected cell types by viral antigens and secretory vesicles detection. Its expression in AT2 cells is variable in different donors, which may be associated with different susceptibility and seriousness[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>].<br/><br/>2019-nCov-invaded cell in lung and its number might be associated with the severity of respiratory symptoms, which can explain the existence of asymptomatic<br/><br/>Thus, we suppose that<br/><br/>AT2 cells might be the key<br/><br/>2019-nCov carrier.<br/><br/>ACE2 was also highly expressed in the esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells.<br/><br/>Histologically, both esophagus and respiratory system organs, such as trachea and lung are originated from the anterior portion of the intermediate foregut[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. After being separated from the neighboring respiratory system, the esophagus undergoes subsequent morphogenesis of a simple columnar-to-stratified squamous epithelium conversion[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. The stratified squamous epithelium can be nourished by submucosal glands and sustain the passing of the abrasive raw food. In Barrett\u2019s oesophagus (BE), acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium (MLE) are associated with both upper and stratified epithelial cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>].<br/><br/>In the digestive system, besides esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells, ACE2 was also found in the absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, the most vulnerable intestinal epithelial cells. In microbe infections, the intestinal epithelial cells function as a barrier and help to coordinate immune responses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. The absorptive enterocytes can be infected by coronavirus, rotavirus and noroviruses, resulting in diarrhea by destructing absorptive enterocytes, malabsorption, unbalanced intestinal secretion and activated enteric nervous system[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. Thus, we suppose that the enteric symptom of diarrhea might be associated with the invaded<br/><br/>ACE2-expressing enterocytes. In addition, due to the high expression of cell receptor<br/><br/>ACE2 in esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, we suppose that digestive system can be invaded by<br/><br/>2019-nCov and serve as a route of infection."

In this study, we found the high expressions of ACE2, the cell entry receptor of 2019-nCov, in the lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, indicating that not only respiratory system but also digestive system are potential routes of infection.
