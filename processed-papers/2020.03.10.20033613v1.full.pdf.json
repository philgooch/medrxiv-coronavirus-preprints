            "According to the reports of scholars in the main epidemic area, the primary clinical symptoms of COVID-19-infected patients are fever, dry cough, fatigue, and the gradual development of respiratory problems, with fever being the most typical. Only few patients will present with obvious upper respiratory symptoms (e.g., runny nose, sneezing and sore throat), and diarrhea, headache and hemoptysis are rare [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Patients with mild infection may show only slight fatigue and no fever [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Critically ill patients may develop symptoms such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] in addition to symptoms such as shortness of breath, audible wet sounds in both lungs, and weak breath sounds. Dullness on percussion and tactile tremor may be increased or decreased [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. In our study, we found that the clinical symptoms in COVID-19-infected patients in the secondary epidemic area were similar to those in patients in the primary epidemic area, but there were some inconsistencies. In the secondary epidemic area, the main symptoms were fever, mainly moderate- to low-grade fever. Cough was not usually dry and was often accompanied by white phlegm. Fatigue and muscle aches were not seen in most patients. The symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (such as sneezing, runny nose, sore throat and itching) were not uncommon. The symptoms of chest distress and chest pain were less common in the secondary epidemic area than in the main epidemic area; this may be related to the rapid diagnosis in the secondary epidemic area and early treatment and intervention. Moreover, critical patients were rare, which may be related to the younger age of patients and the presence fewer complications in the secondary epidemic area than in the main epidemic area."

Critically ill patients may develop symptoms such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] in addition to symptoms such as shortness of breath, audible wet sounds in both lungs, and weak breath sounds. Dullness on percussion and tactile tremor may be increased or decreased [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. In our study, we found that the clinical symptoms in COVID-19-infected patients in the secondary epidemic area were similar to those in patients in the primary epidemic area, but there were some inconsistencies. In the secondary epidemic area, the main symptoms were fever, mainly moderate- to low-grade fever. Cough was not usually dry and was often accompanied by white phlegm. Fatigue and muscle aches were not seen in most patients. The symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (such as sneezing, runny nose, sore throat and itching) were not uncommon. The symptoms of chest distress and chest pain were less common in the secondary epidemic area than in the main epidemic area; this may be related to the rapid diagnosis in the secondary epidemic area and early treatment and intervention. Moreover, critical patients were rare, which may be related to the younger age of patients and the presence fewer complications in the secondary epidemic area than in the main epidemic area.",
            "According to a report from the main epidemic area, COVID-19-infected patients had limited lung lesions at the early stage of onset. CT showed multiple lesions and rarely single lesions in the lungs. CT findings appeared as localized small patches, sub-segmented or large ground glass shadows. Local leaflets were widely spaced and were with or without thickening. Progressive CT showed increased lesions, with some expanded lesions, and multiple lung lobes were involved; the density of the lesions increased, and irregular, wedge-shaped or fan-shaped consolidations of varying sizes and degrees within the lesions appeared. Mutated shadows or strip shadows coexisted. Diffuse lung lesions can be seen on CT in severe patients, with consolidation as the primary cause, in addition to ground glass shadows and multiple fiber strand shadows; in a few severe cases, \"white lung\" manifestations appeared when most of the lungs were affected, and an air bronchus sign was present [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. The results of imaging examinations of 33 patients in the secondary epidemic area collected in this study were similar to those reported in the main epidemic area, so no further explanation is given in the article.",
            "In patients with COVID-19 infection diagnosed in the main epidemic area, the laboratory examination results at the early stage of the disease showed that the total number of white blood cells decreased or remained normal; the lymphocyte count decreased; the monocyte count increased or remained normal; the liver enzyme, muscle enzyme and myoglobin levels increased in some patients; the C-reactive protein and ESR increased in most patients; procalcitonin remained normal; D-dimer increased in severe patients; lymphocytes progressively decreased; and coagulation function decreased. Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IL-6, and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), remained normal or slightly increased. The level of cytokines in patients with organ failure was significantly increased. In addition, coronavirus nucleic acids were detected in throat swabs, sputum samples, lower respiratory secretions and blood samples [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Among the infected patients, the viral load detected in the secretion of the lower respiratory tract was higher than that detected in the upper respiratory tract [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. The laboratory examination results of the 33 patients showed that the total number of leukocytes in patients with COVID-19 infection in the secondary epidemic area was slightly reduced, normal or slightly increased, and the proportion of lymphocytes in some patients was significantly reduced. Rarely, lymphocytes or neutrophils were increased, and monocytes and eosinophilic acid-base granulocytes were not changed significantly. CRP did not change significantly in all patients with COVID-19 infection, and some patients maintained a normal CRP level, but it was found that serum amyloid A (SAA) increased significantly in most patients that were tested; however, due to the limited amount of data, a statistical analysis was not performed. SAA is an acute-phase protein. SAA significantly increases in viral infection, whereas CRP may not increase or only slightly increase in viral infection without bacterial infection. Moreover, SAA increases in both viral and bacterial infections, and the increase reflects the severity of the infection. At present, it is generally agreed that SAA and CRP should be combined to judge inflammatory activity [14]. Considering that COVID-19 in the secondary epidemic area may occur after the primary epidemic in the main epidemic area, and its toxicity and pathogenicity may be weakened, SAA detection in the secondary epidemic area should be considered to evaluate the occurrence and development of COVID-19 infection. We will focus on the detection of SAA in COVID-19-infected people in follow-up studies.",
            "The significant differences in the ratios between various blood parameters and CRP between the two groups are interesting findings in this study. It has been reported that CRP may not increase or only slightly increase in viral infection without bacterial infection, and the increase indirectly reflects the severity of infection. At present, it is generally accepted that CRP or combined CRP can be used to judge the inflammatory activity [15]. In this study, we found that the ratio between various blood parameters and CRP was significantly increased in patients who had indirect contact with the disease in the epidemic area, suggesting that the change in the reactivity of CRP in COVID-19 infection is greater than the response of various blood parameters. In addition, considering that COVID-19 in the secondary epidemic area may occur after the primary epidemic in the main epidemic area, its toxicity and pathogenicity may be weakened. CRP can be used as a predictive factor prior to changes in leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils and other inflammatory-related blood parameters to comprehensively evaluate the occurrence and development of COVID-19 infection.",
