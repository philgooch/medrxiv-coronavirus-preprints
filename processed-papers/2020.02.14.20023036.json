Importation of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the United Kingdom highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread.",

            "Contact tracing is the main public health response to importations of rare or emerging infectious diseases, and was implemented in the UK during the \u2018containment stage\u2019 of the 2009 influenza pandemic (McLean et al 2010). In more recent years, contact tracing was also a valuable tool following importation of Ebola virus disease into the UK in 2014 (Crook et al 2017) and the cases of monkeypox in the UK in 2018 (Vaughan et al 2018). In general, contact tracing is a highly effective and robust strategy given sufficient resources. The main advantages are that it can identify potentially infected individuals before severe symptoms emerge, and if conducted sufficiently quickly can prevent onward transmission from the secondary cases. Contact tracing has proved hugely successful in the treatment of sexually transmitted infections, where the definition of a contact is relatively straightforward, where infection is often asymptomatic and where the time-scales of transmission are slow (Hogben et al 2016, R\u00f6nn et al 2017). In contrast, the use of contact tracing for novel invading pathogens has received less quantitative consideration, in part due to greater uncertainties over social contact structure (although see Ahmed et al 2018, Hoang et al 2019). Modelling studies have often focused on quantifying the importance of pre-symptomatic and pretracing infectiousness, but are usually based on statistical distributions of contact networks (Fraser et al 2004, Kwok et al 2019). Here we leverage detailed social network data from the UK to model both transmission and the act of tracing, and identify the implications of contact tracing for containment of a novel pathogen, using parameters for the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (Read et al 2020, Li et al 2020)."

            "The UK currently defines a close contact as 15 minutes within 2 meters over two weeks before detection (PHE 2020). Under this definition, there are unlikely to be many untraced secondary cases, although the burden of tracing could be large. Relaxing the definition of a contact (such that longer contact durations are needed) lessens this burden but at the greater risk of undetected cases (Figure 3). Surprisingly, small changes to the reproductive ratio, within the bounds estimated from early data (Figure 4) or even changes to the distribution of infectivity, are predicted to have a relatively modest impact of the success of contact tracing illustrating the robustness of this control measure.",
            "Our model has addressed the simple and optimistic question of whether contact tracing is sufficient to identify secondary infections. The public health implications of this tracing are more complex, and depend on the relative timing of events and the treatment of identified contacts. For contact tracing to be an effective public health measure requires secondary cases to be discovered before they become infectious; hence the time from the primary case becoming infectious to the tracing of their contacts needs to be shorter than the incubation period. Longer time scales would allow tertiary cases to be infected and would snowball the tracing process. In addition, those contacts that are traced either need to be effectively screened for infection and quarantined or otherwise isolated so that they do not pose a risk to others. Therefore, while contact tracing has the potential to control COVID-19 (and other close-contact pathogens) the ultimate success relies on the speed and efficacy with which suspect contacts can be contained."
