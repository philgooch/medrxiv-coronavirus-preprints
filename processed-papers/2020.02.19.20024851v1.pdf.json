        "abstract": "To reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of the 2019 novel coronavirus, 52 2019-nCOV genomes available on 04 February 2020 at GISAID were analysed. The two models used to estimate the reproduction number (coalescent-based exponential growth and a birth-death skyline method) indicated an estimated mean evolutionary rate of 7.8 x 10-4 subs/site/year (range 1.1x10-4\u201315x10-4). The estimated R value was 2.6 (range 2.1-5.1), and increased from 0.8 to 2.4 in December 2019. The estimated mean doubling time of the epidemic was between 3.6 and 4.1 days. This study proves the usefulness of phylogeny in supporting the surveillance of emerging new infections even as the epidemic is growing.",

            "On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared that the outbreak of an infection due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-theinternational-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novelcoronavirus-(2019-nCoV)). Emerging as a human pathogen in the Chinese city of Wuhan, 2019-nCoV (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4) has caused a widespread outbreak of febrile respiratory illness and, as of 13 February 2020, there were 60,349 confirmed cases (including 527 outside mainland China) and a total of 1,360 fatalities (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9e cf[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]). Belonging to the \u03b2-coronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV as there is >70% nucleotide similarity in their approximately 30 kb long genomes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] A recent study has supported the view that, like other \u03b2-coronaviruses causing human infections such as SARS-CoV and MERSCoV, 2019-nCoV originated from bats, and reported 96% genomic identity with a previously detected SARSlike bat coronavirus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] However, it remains unclear whether the spillover also involved a different intermediary animal host. In the case of such an epidemic, it is important to make an as reliable as possible estimate of the basic reproductive number (R0, the number of cases generated from a single infected person) and the dynamics of transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal origin, rate of viral evolution and population dynamics of 2019-nCoV using 52 full genomes of viral strains sampled in different countries on known sampling dates available at the moment when study was performed."

            "Sequence data set<br/><br/>The analysis was based on 52 2019-nCOV sequences publicly available at GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) on 4 February 2020 (https://www.gisaid.org/). The accession IDs, sampling dates and locations are summarized in Table S1. The sequences were aligned using the ClustalW Multiple Alignment program included in the accessory application of Bioedit software, manually controlled, and cropped to a final length of 29,774 bp using BioEdit v. 7.2.6.1 (http://www. mbio.ncsu. edu/ bioedit/ bioedit. html).<br/><br/>Phylodynamic analysis<br/><br/>The simplest evolutionary model best fitting the sequence data was selected using software JmodelTest v.2.1.7 software,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] and proved to be the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model. The virus' phylogeny, evolutionary rates, times of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and demographic growth were co-estimated in a Bayesian framework using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented in v.1.84 of the BEAST package.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] Different coalescent priors and molecular clock models (constant population size, exponential growth, and a Bayesian skyline plot, BSP) were tested using strict and relaxed molecular clock models. Given the large credibility interval and high level of uncertainty due to very close sampling dates, all the estimates were made using days as the unit of time and a normal prior with substitution rates obtained from our preliminary estimates (mean rate 2.2 x 10-6 subs/site/day, with a standard deviation of 1.1 x 10-6). The MCMC analysis was run until convergence with sampling every 100,000 generations. Convergence was assessed by estimating the effective sampling size (ESS) after 10% burn-in using Tracer v.1.7 software (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), and accepting ESS values of 300 or more.

The prompt availability of research data on internet platforms such as the GISAID has allowed us and other research groups to make a phylogenetic reconstruction of the origin of 2019-nCoV and to share these findings with other scientists. The temporal reconstruction of the 2019-nCoV phylogeny obtained in the present study is in line with previous estimates and suggests that the epidemic originated between October and November 2019, several weeks before the first cases were described. This was confirmed by means of coalescent analysis and the birth-death method of estimating the origin of the epidemic. The estimated evolutionary rate is also in line with that of SARS and MERS viruses,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] and the recent estimates concerning 2019-nCoV (http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-67-genomes-08-feb-2020/356). One of the most important epidemiological parameters when monitoring an epidemic is R0 (i.e. the number of secondary cases induced by a single infected individual in a totally susceptible population) because it is fundamental to assess the potential spread of a micro-organism. Its value changes during an epidemic being called the effective reproduction number (Re). R0 is usually estimated on the basis of the growth rate of the number of cases. The available epidemiological estimates of 2019-nCoV R0 range from 2.2 to 2.9, although they changed from 1.4 to >7 during the first phases of the epidemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Recently developed evolutionary models have made it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters on the basis of phylogenesis,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] and a coalescent and a birth-death methods were used to estimate R0 and the changes in the Re of the 2019-nCoV epidemic during a short period of time. This has allowed us to make a preliminary estimate that mean R0 from the beginning of the epidemic to the first days of February 2020 was 2.2 (range 3.6-5.8), and the birth-death skyline analysis showed an increase in Re from <1 to 2.4 (CI 1.53.5) during December 2019. This agrees with the BSP analysis showing an increase in the number of infections in the same period of time. On the same basis, the estimated epidemic doubling time was 3.6 days with a credibility interval between 1 to 7 days. We also tried to calculate it on the basis of the transmission (\u03bb) and recovery rate (\u03b4) estimated using the birth-death model, which lead to an estimated mean doubling time of 4.1 days, with the most probable values falling between 3.9 and 4.3 days. Previous studies have suggested that the doubling time during the early phases of the epidemic was about 7.4 days.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] The difference in the estimate here obtained, may be due to the increased epidemic growth rate observed during the last days of January, or the initial delay in recognising and reporting new cases. This preliminary study has some limitations. The R values and doubling times were estimated phylogentically using all of the whole genomes available in a public database at the time the study was carried out (https://www.gisaid.org/). Given the small number of sequences and the relatively short sampling period, the credibility intervals are wide and limit the precision of the estimates. Moreover, the analysis included isolates collected outside mainland China as it is assumed that they all belong to the same epidemic originating in Wuhan. Serial intervals were used to estimate the duration of infectiousness, although we do not yet have any information concerning the possible existence and duration of a latent (pre-infectious) period that would contribute to the serial interval. More detailed and accurate analyses can be made when a larger number of genomes and more precise data on the infectious period become available. However, although the R0 calculated on the basis of the direct observation of the number of infected individuals may be affected by omissions or delayed notifications of cases,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] a phylogenetic estimate of the same parameter may be more reliable. This became particularly evident recently (on February 12, 2020) when the change in diagnosis classification led to a sudden increase in the reported cases by Hubei, China (https://myemail.constantcontact.com/COVID-19-Updates---Feb12.html?soid=1107826135286&aid=Kdg8a0rBTAk). In conclusion, these results allowed us to make a phylogenetic estimate of the R0 of 2019-CoV infection that is similar to that obtained using conventional epidemiological methods[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] (https://www.who.int/newsroom/detail/23-01-2020-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov), and a possibly shorter estimated doubling time of the number of subjects involved at least during the early phases of the epidemic.

The two models used to estimate the reproduction number (coalescent-based exponential growth and a birth-death skyline method) indicated an estimated mean evolutionary rate of 7.8 x 10-4 subs/site/year (range 1.1x10-4\u201315x10-4). The estimated R value was 2.6 (range 2.1-5.1), and increased from 0.8 to 2.4 in December 2019. The estimated mean doubling time of the epidemic was between 3.6 and 4.1 days. This study proves the usefulness of phylogeny in supporting the surveillance of emerging new infections even as the epidemic is growing."

            "On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared that the outbreak of an infection due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-theinternational-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novelcoronavirus-(2019-nCoV)). Emerging as a human pathogen in the Chinese city of Wuhan, 2019-nCoV (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4) has caused a widespread outbreak of febrile respiratory illness and, as of 13 February 2020, there were 60,349 confirmed cases (including 527 outside mainland China) and a total of 1,360 fatalities (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9e cf[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]). Belonging to the \u03b2-coronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV as there is >70% nucleotide similarity in their approximately 30 kb long genomes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] A recent study has supported the view that, like other \u03b2-coronaviruses causing human infections such as SARS-CoV and MERSCoV, 2019-nCoV originated from bats, and reported 96% genomic identity with a previously detected SARSlike bat coronavirus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] However, it remains unclear whether the spillover also involved a different intermediary animal host. In the case of such an epidemic, it is important to make an as reliable as possible estimate of the basic reproductive number (R0, the number of cases generated from a single infected person) and the dynamics of transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal origin, rate of viral evolution and population dynamics of 2019-nCoV using 52 full genomes of viral strains sampled in different countries on known sampling dates available at the moment when study was performed."

The available epidemiological estimates of 2019-nCoV R0 range from 2.2 to 2.9, although they changed from 1.4 to >7 during the first phases of the epidemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Recently developed evolutionary models have made it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters on the basis of phylogenesis,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] and a coalescent and a birth-death methods were used to estimate R0 and the changes in the Re of the 2019-nCoV epidemic during a short period of time. This has allowed us to make a preliminary estimate that mean R0 from the beginning of the epidemic to the first days of February 2020 was 2.2 (range 3.6-5.8), and the birth-death skyline analysis showed an increase in Re from <1 to 2.4 (CI 1.53.5) during December 2019. This agrees with the BSP analysis showing an increase in the number of infections in the same period of time. On the same basis, the estimated epidemic doubling time was 3.6 days with a credibility interval between 1 to 7 days. We also tried to calculate it on the basis of the transmission (\u03bb) and recovery rate (\u03b4) estimated using the birth-death model, which lead to an estimated mean doubling time of 4.1 days, with the most probable values falling between 3.9 and 4.3 days. Previous studies have suggested that the doubling time during the early phases of the epidemic was about 7.4 days.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] The difference in the estimate here obtained, may be due to the increased epidemic growth rate observed during the last days of January, or the initial delay in recognising and reporting new cases. This preliminary study has some limitations. The R values and doubling times were estimated phylogentically using all of the whole genomes available in a public database at the time the study was carried out (https://www.gisaid.org/). Given the small number of sequences and the relatively short sampling period, the credibility intervals are wide and limit the precision of the estimates. Moreover, the analysis included isolates collected outside mainland China as it is assumed that they all belong to the same epidemic originating in Wuhan. Serial intervals were used to estimate the duration of infectiousness, although we do not yet have any information concerning the possible existence and duration of a latent (pre-infectious) period that would contribute to the serial interval. More detailed and accurate analyses can be made when a larger number of genomes and more precise data on the infectious period become available. However, although the R0 calculated on the basis of the direct observation of the number of infected individuals may be affected by omissions or delayed notifications of cases,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] a phylogenetic estimate of the same parameter may be more reliable. This became particularly evident recently (on February 12, 2020) when the change in diagnosis classification led to a sudden increase in the reported cases by Hubei, China (https://myemail.constantcontact.com/COVID-19-Updates---Feb12.html?soid=1107826135286&aid=Kdg8a0rBTAk). In conclusion, these results allowed us to make a phylogenetic estimate of the R0 of 2019-CoV infection that is similar to that obtained using conventional epidemiological methods[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] (https://www.who.int/newsroom/detail/23-01-2020-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov), and a possibly shorter estimated doubling time of the number of subjects involved at least during the early phases of the epidemic. They also support the usefulness of phylodynamic as an important complement to classic approaches to the surveillance and monitoring of an emerging infection, even during the course of an epidemic."
