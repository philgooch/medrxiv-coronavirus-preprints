        "abstract": "Background: Since the 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk. The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. Method: We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow-SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study, the self-protection at home is also included in quarantine. Results: In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of infections. In general, the quarantine is much more effective than the traffic blockage control.\nConclusion: Both of quarantine and traffic blockage are effective ways to control the spread of",

            "Both of quarantine and traffic blockage are effective ways to control the spread of<br/><br/>COVID-19. However, the eff icacy of quarantine is found to be much stronger than that of traffic blockage. Considering traffic blockage may also cause huge losses of economy, we propose to gradually deregulate the traffic blockage, and improve quarantine instead. Also, there might be a large number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, the quarantine should be continued for a long time until the epidemic is totally under control. 1<br/><br/>Keywords: 2019-nCoV; SARS-COV-2; COVID-19; Flow-SEIR model; quarantine; traffic blockage control Abbreviations: 2019-nCoV, 2019 Novel Coronavirus; SARS-COV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Flow-SEIR model, flow-suceptible-exposed-infection-recovery model; COVID-19, corona virus disease 2019."

            "The efficacy of quarantine and traffic blockage<br/><br/>Both the quarantine factors and traffic blockage factors are taken between 0 to 1. In Fig 2, the current quarantine factor of Hubei province is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine. If we increase the factor by 0.01, the peak number of infections will decrease by 5.53%. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, if we incease the factor by 0.01, the peak number of infections will decrease by 14.64%. On the other hand, when \u07dd is close to 1, all the population is isolated from others, the peak value will decrease by 89.68%. However, when \u07dd tends to 0, all the population flows are control free, and the peak value will increase by 20.4%. As shown in Fig 3, the peak number of cases decrease as the traffic blockage factor increases.<br/><br/>For Hubei province, the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who flowed out from Hubei, if we increase the factor by 0.1, the peak number of infections will decrease by 2.14%. For the provinces except Hubei, the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26, if we incease the factor by 0.1, the peak number of infections will decrease by 4.01%. When the traffic blockage factor \u07ec is close to 1, the target area is almost completely in blockage, the peak value will decrease by 21.06% - 22.39% to the case that \u07ec tends to 0.<br/><br/>Clearly, self-isolation and quarantine is more effective than traffic blockage.<br/><br/>The efficacy of earlier warning of COVID-19 We estimated the trend of confirmed cases with quarantine at different time periods. As shown in Fig 4, the quarantine factor \u07dd increase by 0.01, the peak arrival time in Hubei will arrive 0-2 days earlier, and the peak arrival time of other provinces outside Hubei will arrive 1-3 days earlier. For Hubei Province, if the quarantine is 1 week delay, the peak value will increase by 8.50% 10.95%. Oppsitely, if the quarantine is 1 week earlier, the peak value will decrease by 24.26% 25.33%, and 2 weeks by 57.10% - 57.46%. For the other provinces, if the quarantine is 1 week of delay, the peak value will increase by 20.92% - 22.77%, but 1 (or 2, resp.) week earlier will decrease by 32.78% - 35.60% (or 63.75% - 67.13%, resp.).<br/><br/>Concretely, we estimated the trends of epidemic, assume that the traffic blockage started on Jan. 9, Jan. 16, Jan. 23 and Jan. 30, respectively. In this experiment, we assumed that the traffic flow between provinces would be completely cut off. As shown in Fig 5, when the traffic blockage factor \u07ec increase by 0.1 for Hubei, the peak arrival time will be earlier and the peak number of cases will be lower. If the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of cases only decreased by 3.10% - 3.79%, and two weeks by 6.64% - 8.08%. This illustrates that in the eve of city closure in Wuhan, the epidemic in Hubei province had been severe, and the transmission rate was quite high. However, in other provinces outside Hubei, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of cases will decrease by 15.30% - 16.70%, and two weeks earlier, it will decrease by 31.74% - 33.09% .<br/><br/>Finally, we estimated the daily change of number of cases nationwide. If there is one day earlier of traffic blockage, about 3,600 cases will eventually be reduced in the mainland of China, but one day delay might increase 1,800 cases."

        "conclusions": [
            "In this study, we have used a Flow-SEIR model to numerically estimate the efficacy of the quarantine and traffic blockage. We introduced both the the quarantine factor and the traffic blockage factor, then the flow variable and transmission rate in the model will vary as the change of these two intervation factors, then the effectiveness of the traffic blockage and quarantine can be simulated and evaluated.<br/><br/>In the simulated results, we conclude that if the masses take protective measures, the peak number of cases will decrease greatly by 89.68%. However, if the masses completely ignored self-isolation, the peak is predicted to increase by 20.40%. And if the external population flows to the target area is almost completely blocked, the peak number will decrease by 21.06%-22.38%. Earlier warning, timely traffic blockage and quarantine measures are extremely effective, especially for areas with slight epidemic situations. The experimental results also show that if there is one day earlier of traffic blockage, about 3,600 cases will eventually be reduced in the mainland China, and one day delay will result in additional 1,800 cases at risk."

        "discussion": [
            "Applying the latest migration population data from Baidu Migration, and varying the traffic blockage factor, we can use the Flow-SEIR model to simulate the number of infections and then intuitively understand the efficacy of the traffic blockage.<br/><br/>However, our study has several major limitations. First, the accuracy of results can be improved provided the source of data is more reliable and sufficient. Since in Hubei the medical resources are overburdened and the methods to diagnose the COVID-9 are not accurate, even the diagnosis changed several times, the underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis are invetiable, then the confirmed cases are underestimated. Secondly, there is heterogenity in transmission, it is not added in our study, and we also did not district the age distribution in our model.<br/><br/>The study has numerically estimated the efficacy of traffic blockage and quarantine. We confirm by simulated quantification evidence that the traffic blockage is effective in controlling the epidemic of COVID-19, and the quarantine is a more effective way to help the public to prevent cross-infection. With the development of the epidemic, we have to admit the fact that there are still a number of population who are exposed to the COVID-19 without clinical symptoms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Those population may carry the COVID-19 for several days and might infect others who are closely contacting with, which makes the potentional risk. Thus we encourage the people to be self-protective until the epidemic is totally under control."

            "1 Parameters estimation According to our the assumption A1, firstly we estimated the number of potential suceptibles by the iteration process. We define the loss function as follows:    \u202b\u072e\u202c    \u0d4c    1 \u0730    \u0bc7    \u0dcd\u123a\u202b\u0756\u202c\u0be1    \u0d46    \u202b\u0302\u0756\u202c\u0be1\u123b\u0b36    #\u123a4\u123b<br/><br/>\u0be1\u0b40\u0b35 where N is the length of the real data, which in practical is the count of days. \u202b\u0756\u202c\u0be1 is the nth real data value, and n=1,2,...,N , \u202b\u0302\u0756\u202c\u0be1 is the nth predicted value, based on the model. We fitted the confirmed data from Jan.12 to Feb. 7 to get the optimal number of potential suceptibles by minimizing the loss value. The loss value is small enough to make the estimated results fitting the real data well. The parameters in the Flow-SEIR model can also be estimated in the same way.<br/><br/>For the problem of high death rate in Hubei Province, we reduced the ratio of \u07db\u0b35 and \u07db\u0b36 of Hubei\u2019s model according to the real data that \u07db\u0b35\u0be5\u0bd8\u0bd4\u0bdf \u0d4c \u202b\u07db \u07db \u074d\u202c, \u0b35 \u0b35 \u0b36\u0be5\u0bd8\u0bd4\u0bdf \u0d4c \u202b\u074d\u202c\u0b36\u07db\u0b36. For the situation that the medical resouces are limited in Wuhan, the number of infections will be larger than the released data, we enlarged the ratio of \u03b1 of Hubei\u2019s model, that \u07d9\u0be5\u0bd8\u0bd4\u0bdf \u0d4c \u202b\u07d9\u074c\u202c.<br/><br/>And there is data latency problem, because the epidemic has an incubation period and the infections can not be diagnosed timely. For the data latency problem, it can be assumed that the number of confirmed cases published on one day is the number of confirmed cases \u074a\u0bdc days ago, and \u074a\u0bdc is the number of delayed days in the ith province, expressed as<br/><br/>\u202b\u072b\u202c\u0be5\u0bd8\u0bd4\u0bdf\u123a\u202b\u0750\u202c\u123b \u0d4c \u202b \u072b\u202c\u123a\u202b \u0750\u202c\u0bd7\u0bd4\u0be7\u0bd4 \u0d46 \u074a\u0bdc\u123b#\u123a5\u123b<br/><br/>For Hubei, due to the above factors, the latency will be relatively long, which may reach 5-7 days. For other provinces, if patients can get treatment in time, the delay should only include the time waiting for the result of the diagnostic reagents, is about 1-2 day.",

            "Both the quarantine factors and traffic blockage factors are taken between 0 to 1. In Fig 2, the current quarantine factor of Hubei province is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine. If we increase the factor by 0.01, the peak number of infections will decrease by 5.53%. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, if we incease the factor by 0.01, the peak number of infections will decrease by 14.64%. On the other hand, when \u07dd is close to 1, all the population is isolated from others, the peak value will decrease by 89.68%. However, when \u07dd tends to 0, all the population flows are control free, and the peak value will increase by 20.4%. As shown in Fig 3, the peak number of cases decrease as the traffic blockage factor increases.",
            "For Hubei province, the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who flowed out from Hubei, if we increase the factor by 0.1, the peak number of infections will decrease by 2.14%. For the provinces except Hubei, the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26, if we incease the factor by 0.1, the peak number of infections will decrease by 4.01%. When the traffic blockage factor \u07ec is close to 1, the target area is almost completely in blockage, the peak value will decrease by 21.06% - 22.39% to the case that \u07ec tends to 0.",
            "Clearly, self-isolation and quarantine is more effective than traffic blockage.",
            "The efficacy of earlier warning of COVID-19 We estimated the trend of confirmed cases with quarantine at different time periods. As shown in Fig 4, the quarantine factor \u07dd increase by 0.01, the peak arrival time in Hubei will arrive 0-2 days earlier, and the peak arrival time of other provinces outside Hubei will arrive 1-3 days earlier. For Hubei Province, if the quarantine is 1 week delay, the peak value will increase by 8.50% 10.95%. Oppsitely, if the quarantine is 1 week earlier, the peak value will decrease by 24.26% 25.33%, and 2 weeks by 57.10% - 57.46%. For the other provinces, if the quarantine is 1 week of delay, the peak value will increase by 20.92% - 22.77%, but 1 (or 2, resp.) week earlier will decrease by 32.78% - 35.60% (or 63.75% - 67.13%, resp.).",
            "Concretely, we estimated the trends of epidemic, assume that the traffic blockage started on Jan. 9, Jan. 16, Jan. 23 and Jan. 30, respectively. In this experiment, we assumed that the traffic flow between provinces would be completely cut off. As shown in Fig 5, when the traffic blockage factor \u07ec increase by 0.1 for Hubei, the peak arrival time will be earlier and the peak number of cases will be lower. If the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of cases only decreased by 3.10% - 3.79%, and two weeks by 6.64% - 8.08%. This illustrates that in the eve of city closure in Wuhan, the epidemic in Hubei province had been severe, and the transmission rate was quite high. However, in other provinces outside Hubei, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of cases will decrease by 15.30% - 16.70%, and two weeks earlier, it will decrease by 31.74% - 33.09% .",
            "Finally, we estimated the daily change of number of cases nationwide. If there is one day earlier of traffic blockage, about 3,600 cases will eventually be reduced in the mainland of China, but one day delay might increase 1,800 cases."
        ],
        "Conclusions": [
            "In this study, we have used a Flow-SEIR model to numerically estimate the efficacy of the quarantine and traffic blockage. We introduced both the the quarantine factor and the traffic blockage factor, then the flow variable and transmission rate in the model will vary as the change of these two intervation factors, then the effectiveness of the traffic blockage and quarantine can be simulated and evaluated.",
            "In the simulated results, we conclude that if the masses take protective measures, the peak number of cases will decrease greatly by 89.68%. However, if the masses completely ignored self-isolation, the peak is predicted to increase by 20.40%. And if the external population flows to the target area is almost completely blocked, the peak number will decrease by 21.06%-22.38%. Earlier warning, timely traffic blockage and quarantine measures are extremely effective, especially for areas with slight epidemic situations. The experimental results also show that if there is one day earlier of traffic blockage, about 3,600 cases will eventually be reduced in the mainland China, and one day delay will result in additional 1,800 cases at risk."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "Applying the latest migration population data from Baidu Migration, and varying the traffic blockage factor, we can use the Flow-SEIR model to simulate the number of infections and then intuitively understand the efficacy of the traffic blockage.",
            "However, our study has several major limitations. First, the accuracy of results can be improved provided the source of data is more reliable and sufficient. Since in Hubei the medical resources are overburdened and the methods to diagnose the COVID-9 are not accurate, even the diagnosis changed several times, the underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis are invetiable, then the confirmed cases are underestimated. Secondly, there is heterogenity in transmission, it is not added in our study, and we also did not district the age distribution in our model.",
            "The study has numerically estimated the efficacy of traffic blockage and quarantine. We confirm by simulated quantification evidence that the traffic blockage is effective in controlling the epidemic of COVID-19, and the quarantine is a more effective way to help the public to prevent cross-infection. With the development of the epidemic, we have to admit the fact that there are still a number of population who are exposed to the COVID-19 without clinical symptoms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Those population may carry the COVID-19 for several days and might infect others who are closely contacting with, which makes the potentional risk. Thus we encourage the people to be self-protective until the epidemic is totally under control."
