A statistical model was constructed 5 to describe the heterogeneity of reporting rate by age and severity. We estimated 6 the number of severe and non-severe cases, accounting for under-ascertainment. 7 Results: The ascertainment rate of non-severe cases was estimated at 0.44 (95% 8 confidence interval: 0.37, 0.50), indicating that unbiased number of non-cases 9 would be more than twice the reported count. Conclusions: Severe cases are twice more likely diagnosed and reported than other cases. Considering that reported cases are usually dominated by non-severe cases, the adjusted total number of cases is also about a double of observed count. Our finding is critical in interpreting the reported data, and it is advised to interpret mild case data of COVID-19 as always under-ascertained.",

We assumed that the ratio of severe to non-severe cases in a given age group is a constant and that the ageindependent gap is explained by the under-diagnosis and under-reporting, estimating the ascertainment rate among non-severe cases to be 0.44.<br/><br/>As a take home, it must be remembered that severe cases are twice more likely diagnosed and reported than other cases. Reported cases are usually dominated by non-severe cases, and the adjusted total number of cases is about a double of observed count. Our finding is critical in interpreting the reported data, and it is advised to regard the mild case data as always under-ascertained.<br/><br/>In addition to the proposed adjustment, it should be noted that the ascertainment rate of severe cases needs to be additionally estimated, and such estimation requires direct measurement of the total number of cases or infected individuals by means of seroepidemiological study or other testing methods of all samples (Nishiura et al, 2020). That is, the actual total number of cases is greater than what it was adjusted in the present study. Using seroepidemiological datasets, we plan to address relevant issues in the future. Other limitations include that (i) we did not explore detailed natural history, e.g. dynamically changing symptoms over the course of infection, and underlying comorbidities,<br/><br/>(ii) we ignored right-censored data, e.g. the time delay from illness onset to severe manifestations, for simplicity. The latter led us to underestimate the ascertainment rate. (iii) it is worth noting that the data of age dependent severity employed in our analysis is only based on the observed data in China.<br/><br/>Considering the possibility of underreporting or biased age distribution, the nature of this age distribution may lead to underestimation.<br/><br/>Despite multiple future tasks, we believe that the present study successfully demonstrated that the ascertainment rate can be partly adjusted by examining age-dependent number of cases including severe cases. The proposed adjustment should be practiced in other country settings and also for other diseases."
