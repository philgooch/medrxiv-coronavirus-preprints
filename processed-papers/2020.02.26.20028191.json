        "abstract": "Background A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world. We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. \nMethods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital\u2032s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. \nFindings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of &gt;[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of &gt;[500] (89.2%), increased C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (&gt;[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. \nConclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.",

Median incubation time was 7 days (IQR 5.0-10.0). Most of the death cases were male (65.9%), older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years (IQR 65.0-80.0). The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (75.6%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). 30 out of 82 dead patients (30.5%) had 2 or more underlying diseases."

            "To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the clinical characteristics of dead patients with COVID-19. The mortality of 6.2% from current study was lower than that of SARS infection in 2003. However, the mortality rate from this center is a little bit higher than previously reported.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] We speculated the reason might be that fewer patients in our study were transferred to the ICU in time when their condition rapidly worsened. On the other hand, limited death cases, less than 15 patients were included in their cohort,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] while much more death cases were included in the present study.<br/><br/>Our study firstly focused on the epidemiological characteristics of dead patients with COVID-19. Several factors were responsible for the death of these patients included in this study. A majority of patients were older than 60 years in our study, and a borderline significant association between age and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. These results are consistent with that older age was more likely occurred in critically ill patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] Moreover, we found underlying diseases such as hypertension, heart disease and diabetes were very common in our death cases, and 30.5% of patients had 2 or more comorbidities. These features are consistent with previous report that patients with underlying diseases more likely developed to severe illness.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] Cancer patients is comprised of 7.3% in our cohort, much higher than cancer morbidity, suggest that cancer patients more likely develop to severe disease, even death. These results are consistent with the findings from a national wide analysis in China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] Immune deficiency to virus infection seems to be the common features in older males with comorbidities."

            "Besides respiratory failure, cardiac failure, hemorrhage, renal failure and even MOF were also recognized as the cause of death by COVID-19 in our study. Laboratory findings also revealed cardiac, hepatic, and renal damage in some of patients. We also observed a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and time from initial symptom to death. These clinical phenomena could be explained by virus itself attack and cytokine release storm (CRS) mediated tissue damage. First, ACE2 expression is also found in the kidney, heart, and liver etc, therefore SARS-CoV-2 could invade the cells of above tissues, reproduce and damage these organ.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] Second, virus infection and subsequent tissue damage either in the lung or other target organ could elicit immune cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely CRS, ultimately injury the tissue and cause target organ failure. Obviously, increased amounts of cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), are associated with severe lung injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] A recent study showed high levels of IL-1\u03b2, interferon \u03b3-induced protein 10 , and MCP-1 occurred in serum of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, which probably leaded to the activation of T-helper-1 cell response[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. In the present report, high level of IL-6 of more than10U/L and C-reactive protein were detected in all patients, even in the last 24 hours prior to death.",
            "We also depicted the immune status of COVID-19 patients with severe illness. Most of patients in our study presented as neutrophilia and lymphopenia on admission, specifically reduced CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell counts were observed in some patients. A high NLR was also observed on the admission and 24 hours before the death. These results, consistent with the previous findings found in the patients with severe illness, suggest perturbation of immune system contribute the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. These observations could be also explained why older males with comorbidities likely succumb to COVID-19.",

Firstly, some patients did not receive timely supportive interventions such as admission to ICU, because increasing number of severe patients occurred in a short period.

            "Overall, from the point of view of the causes of death, we presented the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Lung injury begins with an insult to the lung epithelium mainly attacked by SARS-CoV-2 itself because of ACE2 expressed in the lungs, which leads to most common respiratory failure. Other organs or tissues, more or less, are potentially damaged through direct attack from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, damages of multiple systems including the lungs, might originate with systemic damage due to CRS following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering the pandemic potential and moderate threaten of COVID-19 for population with multiple underlying diseases, further studies are required to focus on pathology and pathophysiology of tissue injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially on the activation process of immune response and cytokines storm.",

            "Data collection The authors retrospectively collected epidemiological and clinical features of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 dead patients from January 11, 2020 to February 10, 2020 in the Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University.",
            "This study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.",
            "The Research Ethics Committee waived the requirement informed consent before the study started because of the urgent need to collect epidemiological and clinical data."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "From January 11, 2020 to February 10, 2020, a total of 1,334 patients with a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recorded in the Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, while 6.2% (82/1334) of patients with this disease were dead.",
            "Most of the death cases were male (65.9%), older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years (IQR 65.0-80.0).",
            "30 out of 82 dead patients (30.5%) had 2 or more underlying diseases",
            "The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (75.6%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). 30 out of 82 dead patients (30.5%) had 2 or more underlying diseases"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "This is the first study to describe the clinical characteristics of dead patients with COVID-19.",
            "A majority of patients were older than 60 years in the study, and a borderline significant association between age and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed",
            "These results are consistent with that older age was more likely occurred in critically ill patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] the authors found underlying diseases such as hypertension, heart disease and diabetes were very common in the death cases, and 30.5% of patients had 2 or more comorbidities.",
            "Immune deficiency to virus infection seems to be the common features in older males with comorbidities"
