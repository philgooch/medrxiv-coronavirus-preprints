        "abstract": "Background: China has been severely affected by COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) since December, 2019. This study aimed to assess the population mental health burden during the epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors.\nMethods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 603 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem.\nResults: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 34.0%, 18.1%, and 18.1%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than older people (P=0.024). Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep quality (P=0.045). Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (&lt; 35 years) and times to focus on the COVID-19 (\u2265 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were associated with poor sleep quality.\nConclusions: Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during COVID-19 epidemic in China. Young people, people who spent too much time on the epidemic, and healthcare workers were at high risk for mental illness. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.",

            "COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019, also known as 2019-nCoV), a cluster of acute respiratory illness with unknown causes, occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China since December 2019 (Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, 2020; Paules et al, 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2020_a\">Wang et al, 2020</a>). As of February 15, 2020, a total of 66,580 COVID-19 cases in China have been confirmed and 1,524 Chinese died from the disease.<br/><br/>Internationally, sporadic cases exported from Wuhan were reported in 25 countries (such as 334 cases in Japan, and 67 cases in Singapore), 5 continents, and 1 international conveyance (218 cases in \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d) (World Health Organization, 2020a).<br/><br/>On January 23, Wuhan city closed all access routes to stop the spread of disease. Seven days later, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 as a Public<br/><br/>Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (World Health Organization, 2020b).<br/><br/>In addition to causing physical damage, COVID-19 also has a serious impact on the mental health of the public. In January 20, China confirmed human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 and some medical staff in Wuhan have been infected (XINHUANET, 2020). Since then, the public has shown anxiety-related behaviors, causing a significant shortage of medical masks and alcohol across the country. On the night of January 31, due to a news release that \u201cShuanghuanglian\u201d oral liquid could suppress COVID-19 (People's daily of China, 2020), the public rushed to pharmacies overnight to buy this drug.

            "Our web-based study show a high prevalence of GAD and poor sleep quality in the<br/><br/>Chinese population during COVID-19 epidemic. Anxiety symptoms were more likely to occur in people younger than 35 years and those who spent too much time focusing on the epidemic. Compared with other professions, healthcare workers were associated with higher risk for poor sleep quality. Our findings provided data support for accurately understand the source of public\u2019s panic during COVID-19 epidemic.<br/><br/>The data in this study suggested public\u2019s levels of anxiety-related symptoms increase when a major infectious diseases occurred. Similar to the psychological burden caused by SARS (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSu_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rSu_et+al_2007_a\">Su et al, 2007</a>), we found that one in three participants showed anxiety disorders, and this mood was not different between male and female during COVID-19 epidemic, which was different from previous research that women were more likely to have anxiety than men (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGuo_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rGuo_et+al_2016_a\">Guo et al, 2016</a>; Gao et al, 2020). In addition, nearly one in five participants had depressive symptoms and sleep problems, indicating that the uncertainty of the epidemic progression would cause greater psychological pressure on the public. The possible reason for these mental problems may be related to the \u201chypochondriac concerns\u201d (worry about being infected) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFurer_et+al_1997_a\" href=\"#rFurer_et+al_1997_a\">Furer et al, 1997</a>) and feared that the epidemic was hard to control."

Previously, when SARS occurred in China, the awareness regarding public\u2019s mental health related to the epidemic was low, and no targeted psychological guidelines available to the public in need during the pandemic period. Therefore, ongoing surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences for outbreaks of epidemic-potential, life-threatening diseases, establishing early targeted mental health interventions, should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide."
