            "In conclusion, considering transmissibility and fatality rate, 2019-nCoV poses a major public health threat, at least at the level of 2003 SARS. Epidemiological studies are critically called for to evaluate the effectiveness of stringent measures such as lockdown and help the design of refinements and development of potential alternative strategies for the next phase of the 2019-nCoV outbreak."
