        "abstract": "Motivated by the rapid spread of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of both domestic and international travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China.  The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.",

            "Motivated by the rapid spread of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of both domestic and international travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.",

            "other possible location. This risk depends on the travel flow from cities in Mainland China to other countries and the disease prevalence in those cities. It is also worth remarking that our traffic flows are origin destination data that do not depend on traveling routes, and are a proxy for the actual mobility demand across cities. In Fig. 3 we provide a visualization of how each one of the top cities in China contribute to the relative risk of the top 20 countries at risk of importation for the dates before and after the travel ban in Wuhan was in effect. In particular, before the travel ban 84% of the internationally imported cases originated from Wuhan; while after the travel ban, the top 10 contributors to the relative risk are needed to account for at least \u223c 80% of the internationally imported cases where the top three contributors are: Shanghai (27.85%), Beijing (14.28%), and Shenzhen (13.68%). In terms of relative risk of importation, the countries at higher risk of importation after the implementation of the Wuhan travel ban are: Japan (11.01% pre-travel ban, 13.97% post-travel ban), Thailand (22.89% pre-travel ban, 12.01% post-travel ban), Republic of Korea (7.48% pre-travel ban, 11.58% post-travel ban), Taiwan (9.32% pre-travel ban, 9.88% post-travel ban), and USA (4.66% pre-travel ban, 5.91% post-travel ban).",
            "Starting early February 2020, 59 airline companies suspended or limited flights to Mainland China and a number of countries including USA, Russia, Australia, and Italy have also imposed government issued travel restrictions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. It is difficult to calculate exactly the level of traffic reduction imposed by these measures. For this reason, we analyze here two major scenarios in which travel restrictions produce a 40% and 90% overall traffic reduction to and from China. The same traffic reductions are also applied domestically in China. Along with travel reductions, we consider three scenarios concerning disease transmissibility: i) a status quo situation with the same transmissibility found from the model calibration through January 23, 2020; ii) a moderate relative reduction of the original transmissibility (25%), corresponding to a transmissibility dampening factor of r = 0.75; and iii) a high reduction (50%) of the original transmissibility (r = 0.50). This relative reduction of transmissibility could be achieved through early detection and isolation of cases, as well as behavioral changes and awareness of the disease in the population. In Fig. 4 we show the combined effects of the travel and transmissibility reductions on the epidemic incidence in Mainland China and the number of exported cases to other countries. The simulated scenarios show that even in the case of drastic travel reductions (Fig. 4D), if tranmissibility is not reduced (r = 1), the epidemic in China is delayed for no more than 2 weeks. The peak of the epidemic in Mainland China is reached at the end of April \u2013 early May, 2020. It is worth remarking that the epidemic peak in Wuhan in the absence of transmissibility reductions falls in the first week of March 2020. The number of cases imported to other countries, Fig. 4A-C, is initially affected by a tenfold reduction, but by March 1st 2020 when there is no transmissibility reduction (r = 1), this number has reached again the levels of 133 and 22 cases per day for the 40% and 90% travel restrictions scenarios, respectively. The concurrent presence of both travel and transmissibility reductions, however, produce a much larger synergistic effect visible by both delaying the epidemic activity in Mainland China and the number of imported cases. In the moderate transmissibility reduction scenarios (r = 0.75) the epidemic peak is delayed to late June 2020 and the total number of international case importations by March 1st 2020 are 21 and 3 cases per day for the 40% and 90% travel restrictions scenarios, respectively. Larger travel limitations (> 90%) will extend the period of time during which the importation of cases is greatly reduced. The"

            "The presented analysis, as all modeling exercises, has a number of limitations and assumptions that are worth considering. The model parameters such as generation time and incubation period are chosen based on early results on the 2019-nCoV outbreak and prior knowledge of SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemiology. While we believe that the model is rather stable to variations in these parameters, more information on the key characteristic of the disease would considerably reduce uncertainties. The transmission and mobility model does not account, at this stage, for heterogeneities due to age differences in susceptibility and contact patterns. The calibration of the model does not consider correlations among importations (family travel) and assumes that travel probabilities are homogeneous across all individuals in the catchment area of each transportation hub. We were not able to find reliable data sources on the effectiveness of containment measures in place in Mainland China before Jan 23 (e.g. body temperature screening for departure in Wuhan International airport) which are thus not included in the model. In the travel restriction scenario we assume long term enforcement of individual mobility restrictions (travel was restricted until the end of June 2020). This might not be a feasible nor sustainable policy for such a long period of time.",
            "Even in presence of the above limitations, the analysis of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV outbreak and the modeling assessment of the effects of travel limitations could be instrumental to national and international agencies for public health response planning. We show that by January 23 2020, the epidemic had already spread to other cities within China. The travel quarantine around Wuhan has only modestly delayed the epidemic spread to other areas of China. This is in agreement with separate studies on the diffusion of the 2019-nCoV virus in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. The model indicates that while the Wuhan travel ban was initially effective at reducing international case importations, the number of cases observed outside China will resume its growth after 2-3 weeks from cases that originated elsewhere. Furthermore, the modeling study shows that additional travel limitations up to 90% of the traffic have a modest effect unless paired with public health interventions and behavioral changes that achieve a considerable reduction in the disease transmissibility [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. The above results provides data with potential uses for the definition of optimized containment schemes and mitigation policies that includes the local and international dimension of the 2019-nCoV epidemic.",
