        "abstract": "Background The outbreak of the recently emerged novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a challenge for public health laboratories. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 6 to February 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab specimens. Findings Of the 238 patients, 194 (81.5%) were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85) whose nucleic acid tests were negative. After the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 47 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the 48 contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive. Interpretation The suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

            "A novel betacoronavirus 1 named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes a recent cluster cases of respiratory illness named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in multiple regions of the world, and it leads to a serious public health problem especially in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China since<br/><br/>December 2019. 2 By March 1, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases have been identified globally both in China and other 58 countries spanning Asia, Europe, Oceania, North and South America, and Northeast Africa. It is evidenced that<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 can transmit rapidly from person to person, which is evidently found in hospital and family settings. 3-5<br/><br/>The SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronaviruses (CoVs). 6-8 Sequence and phylogenetic tree of CoVs analysis indicates that<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 is genetically distinct from SARS-CoV and is more closely related to bat-SL-CoV ZC45 and bat-SL-CoV ZXC21. 1 SARS-CoV-2 owns a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV. 1 A typical CoV contains four main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N)<br/><br/>proteins. The S protein homotrimers are required for attachment to host receptors, 9 and both the M protein and the E protein play important roles in virus assembly. 10,11<br/><br/>The N protein is responsible for packaging the encapsidated genome into virions, 12,13 and acts as a viral RNA silencing suppressor that is beneficial for the viral replication.<br/><br/>overexpressed during infection, 15 indicating that N protein should be a potential<br/><br/>Furthermore, the N protein has high immunogenic activity and is profusely source of a diagnostic antigen for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many diagnostic methods based on the N protein have been developed for SARS-CoV detection. 16-18<br/><br/>In addition, different CoVs possess special structural and accessory proteins, such as<br/><br/>HE protein, 3a/b protein, and 4a/b protein. 19<br/><br/>Both nucleic acid test and serological assay are commonly used for infectious disease screening and diagnosis. In the present case of SARS-CoV-2, nucleic acid test has been being routinely used to detect causative viruses from respiratory secretions by real-time RT-PCR in China. However, the nucleic acid tests appeared to have a high false negative rate because of several unavoidable reasons, including the sensitivity of the detection kits that have not been well assessed, sampling location and technique, etc. A large number of clinically-suspected patients, whose nucleic acid tests were negative, are unable to get timely confirmed-diagnosis and hospital treatment, which potentially promotes the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and leads to a rapid disease progress of the suspected patients.<br/><br/>In this study, a newly-developed IgM and IgG antibody detecting Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) based on a recombinant fragment of SARS-CoV-2 N protein were used to detect IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in serum of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The clinical characteristics of the patients were shown in Table 1. The median age was 55 years (IQR, 38.3-65), and 138 (58.0%) of the patients were men. Hypertension (63 [26.5%]), diabetes (25<br/><br/>[10.5%]), and cardiovascular disease (24 [10.1%]) were the most common coexisting disorders. Of these patients, the most common symptoms at illness onset were fever (206 [86.6%]), dry cough (128 [53.8%]), and fatigue (78 [32.8%]). A small number of patients possessed the symptoms of abdominal pain (1 [0.4%]), vomiting (3 [1.3%]), and dizziness (4 [1.7%]). On admission, leucocytes were below the normal range in (17.2%) patients and above the normal range in 21 (8.8%) patients. 125 (52.5%)<br/><br/>patients had lymphocytes below the normal range and no patients were found to have lymphocytes above the normal range. Neutrophils were below the normal range in 28<br/><br/>(11.8%) patients and above the normal range in 32 (13.4%) patients. According to CT,<br/><br/>(98.7%) patients showed ground-glass opacity and/or patchy shadowing.<br/><br/>According to the positive or negative results of real time RT-PCR assay for pharyngeal swab specimens, the enrolled patients were divided into two groups: the confirmed group and the suspected group. There were no statistical differences of baseline characteristics of the two groups patients.<br/><br/>Performance and validation of ELISA assays for viral specific IgM and IgG antibodies<br/><br/>Each serum sample of 238 patients were respectively tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by using newly-developed ELISA kits based on N protein of SARS-CoV-2. The IgM and/or IgG could be detected in 194 serum samples, and the positive rate ( 81.5% ) was significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>RNA detected by real time RT-PCR, which was 64.3% (153/238) (Fig.1A).<br/><br/>Importantly, there were no difference in positive rates of IgM and/or IgG between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85)<br/><br/>(Fig.1B), suggesting that the clinically suspected patients, who were viral RNA negative detected by RT-PCR, were mostly infected.<br/><br/>To verify the specificity of the ELISA assays, the serum samples from 70 randomly-selected ordinary patients and 50 healthy blood donors were simultaneously detected. Four samples from the ordinary patients were identified as antibody positive (including one dual positive sample, two IgM-positive samples, and one IgG-positive sample) and no positive was found in the samples of healthy blood donors (Fig.1A).<br/><br/>These results confirmed the specificity of the IgG and IgM ELISA assays.<br/><br/>Dynamic analysis of ELISA and RT-PCR assays<br/><br/>To study the diagnostic value of ELISA assay for virus-specific antibodies, especially in the early stage of the disease, we tried to analyze the positive rates of<br/><br/>ELISA and RT-PCR assays in the different stages of disease. To this end, each patient was assigned to different days after initial onset of symptoms based on the time when the pharyngeal swab specimen was detected to be positive or the last recoded detection was still negative, or the blood was collected. The positive rates of viral<br/><br/>RNA, IgM and/or IgG were compared in every day after initial onset of symptoms (Table 2). Due to a small number of samples in each individual day, we pooled the samples in which the positive rates were similar in consecutive days. Thus, the disease process were divided into five phases of 0-5, 6-10,11-12, 13-15 days and more than days after initial onset of symptoms (Table 3 & Fig.2). The data showed that positive rates of IgM and/or IgG were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms because there was no antibody produced in most of patients in this early stage, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. Day 11 after initial onset of symptoms is a key time point because the positive rates of IgM and/or IgG jumped to above 80% from less than 50% at this time point. The dynamic pattern is consistent with SARS-CoV infection. 21 On the contrary, the real-time RT-PCR was more effective for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection than ELISA in the early stage of disease.<br/><br/>The positive rate of viral RNA detected by RT-PCR was maintained above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased with the rapid increase of positive rate of antibodies. These results demonstrated that ELISA-based<br/><br/>IgM and/or IgG detection should be used as a major viral diagnostic test for the patients with symptoms for more than 10 days. Because about 50%<br/><br/>clinically-suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be positive by ELISA-based IgM and/or IgG detection (Table 4), the combination of<br/><br/>ELISA and RT-PCR assays will greatly improve the detection efficacy, even in the early stage of COVID-19 infection."

        "discussion": [
            "The outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a challenge for public health laboratories, especially for clinical laboratories of the hospitals in Wuhan, China. Although serological assay is a frequently used method for viral infection screening and diagnosis, there are few reports about serological assay in detection of SARS-CoV-2 up to now. In this study, we report the application of the<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 N protein-based ELISA for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies in the admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results showed that the positive rates of IgM and IgG were significantly higher than that of viral RNA detected by real-time RT-PCR on the pharyngeal swab specimens of all enrolled patients. This result is further supported by the fact that the suspected patients had the same positive rate of antibody as the confirmed patients. These data strongly demonstrated that the clinically suspected patients were mostly infected by    SARS-CoV-2.<br/><br/>In this study, the serum samples were collected in a time period of 9 days from the patients in different stages of disease. The positive rates of nucleic acid test and serological assay in total populations cannot reflect their diagnostic value in surveillance and control of the disease, because the production of antiviral antibodies will decrease the positive rates of the nucleic acid test as the disease progresses. In order to objectively determine the disease stage of the patients, we used the initial onset of symptoms of the patients as the start time point. Based on the day when the test sample was collected, all patients were defined to the different stages of disease.<br/><br/>The resulted dynamics patterns of positive rates of viral RNA and antiviral antibodies proved the rationality of the disease stage definition. Our analysis identified the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms as a key time point in the disease process when most infected patients produce antiviral antibodies. After this time point, the diagnosis for viral infection should majorly depend on serological assay. Before this time point, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy.<br/><br/>According to the rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 currently implemented in China, 20 a confirmed case of COVID-19 patients exclusively depends on the positive result of nucleic acid test or virus gene sequencing. Although this is a preliminary ELISA assay for SARS-CoV-2, our study strongly demonstrate that serological assay is very important for surveillance and control of the current COVID-19, especially in Wuhan of China, where a lot of patients are waiting to be confirmed at present. Moreover, most of patients had symptoms for more than 11 days."

The data showed that positive rates of IgM and/or IgG were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms because there was no antibody produced in most of patients in this early stage, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. Day 11 after initial onset of symptoms is a key time point because the positive rates of IgM and/or IgG jumped to above 80% from less than 50% at this time point.

        "Discussion": [
            "The outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a challenge for public health laboratories, especially for clinical laboratories of the hospitals in Wuhan, China. Although serological assay is a frequently used method for viral infection screening and diagnosis, there are few reports about serological assay in detection of SARS-CoV-2 up to now. In this study, we report the application of the",
            "SARS-CoV-2 N protein-based ELISA for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies in the admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results showed that the positive rates of IgM and IgG were significantly higher than that of viral RNA detected by real-time RT-PCR on the pharyngeal swab specimens of all enrolled patients. This result is further supported by the fact that the suspected patients had the same positive rate of antibody as the confirmed patients. These data strongly demonstrated that the clinically suspected patients were mostly infected by",
            "SARS-CoV-2.",
            "In this study, the serum samples were collected in a time period of 9 days from the patients in different stages of disease. The positive rates of nucleic acid test and serological assay in total populations cannot reflect their diagnostic value in surveillance and control of the disease, because the production of antiviral antibodies will decrease the positive rates of the nucleic acid test as the disease progresses. In order to objectively determine the disease stage of the patients, we used the initial onset of symptoms of the patients as the start time point. Based on the day when the test sample was collected, all patients were defined to the different stages of disease.",
            "The resulted dynamics patterns of positive rates of viral RNA and antiviral antibodies proved the rationality of the disease stage definition. Our analysis identified the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms as a key time point in the disease process when most infected patients produce antiviral antibodies. After this time point, the diagnosis for viral infection should majorly depend on serological assay. Before this time point, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 currently implemented in China, 20 a confirmed case of COVID-19 patients exclusively depends on the positive result of nucleic acid test or virus gene sequencing. Although this is a preliminary ELISA assay for SARS-CoV-2, our study strongly demonstrate that serological assay is very important for surveillance and control of the current COVID-19, especially in Wuhan of China, where a lot of patients are waiting to be confirmed at present. Moreover, most of patients had symptoms for more than 11 days."

        "RNA, IgM and/or IgG were compared in every day after initial onset of symptoms (Table 2)",
        "Due to a small number of samples in each individual day, we pooled the samples in which the positive rates were similar in consecutive days",
        "The disease process were divided into five phases of 0-5, 6-10,11-12, 13-15 days and more than days after initial onset of symptoms (Table 3 & Fig.2)",
        "The data showed that positive rates of IgM and/or IgG were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms because there was no antibody produced in most of patients in this early stage, and rapidly increased as the disease progressed",
        "The dynamic pattern is consistent with SARS-CoV infection",
        "The positive rate of viral RNA detected by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction was maintained above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and rapidly decreased with the rapid increase of positive rate of antibodies",

        "The positive rates of nucleic acid test and serological assay in total populations cannot reflect their diagnostic value in surveillance and control of the disease, because the production of antiviral antibodies will decrease the positive rates of the nucleic acid test as the disease progresses",
        "Based on the day when the test sample was collected, all patients were defined to the different stages of disease",
        "The resulted dynamics patterns of positive rates of viral RNA and antiviral antibodies proved the rationality of the disease stage definition",
        "Our analysis identified the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms as a key time point in the disease process when most infected patients produce antiviral antibodies",
