        "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading over China and more than 30 countries in last two months. COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. We develop a model SUQC to adequately characterizes the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models.\n\nThe SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We find that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing have a reproductive number R&gt;1, and after January 30, all regions have a reproductive number R&lt;1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after Feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. The un-quarantined infected individuals in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on February 21th, 2020. \n\nAfter fitting the model with recent data, we predict that the end times of COVID-19 of Wuhan and Hubei are around late-March, of China (excluding Hubei) around mid-March, and of the four tier-one cities before March 2020. A total of 80,511 individuals of the whole country are infected, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei(excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). We suggest the rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late-March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other counties in a high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan and Iran.",

Firstly, COVID-19 has a relatively long incubation period which causes a time delay between real dynamic and the daily observed case numbers. Secondly, the epidemic trend heavily depends on multiple artificial factors, including local medical resources, quarantine measures, and the efficiency of conformation approaches, which should be explicitly modeled. For example, the outbreak is more severe in Wuhan compared to other cities in China which constrains the medical resources, therefore the infected need a longer time to be confirmed and reported in the official released numbers. This potentially leads to a larger difference between real and reported infected cases in Wuhan than in other places. This could also explain why a sudden increase of confirmed infected cases was observed when clinical diagnosis was adopted in confirmation in Wuhan. Lastly, the quarantine measures are widely implemented, and the quarantined have a lower chance to infect the susceptible individuals. This is critical for controlling author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

            "The characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak and control are distinct from existing infectious diseases, and the existing epidemic models cannot be applied to describe the observed data directly.",
            "We thus propose to use a simple SUQC model (Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected). SUQC distinguishes the infected individuals to be un-quarantined, quarantined but not confirmed, and confirmed. Among the three types, the confirmed number is the data we can directly observe from the official released report. Only un-quarantined infected have ability to infect susceptible individuals and affect the development of the epidemic. In our proposed model, the quarantine rate parameter is used to quantify the strength of quarantine policy on the development of epidemics, and the confirmation rate parameter is used to measure the efficiency of confirmation based on the released data. The two parameters can solve from fitting the observed confirmed cases over time. Note that the model contains only four variables and three parameters to model both artificial factors and characteristics of epidemics using the data we can directly observe. We expect that the simplified model will not over fit the data given the short time span, but will adequately characterize the essential dynamics.",
