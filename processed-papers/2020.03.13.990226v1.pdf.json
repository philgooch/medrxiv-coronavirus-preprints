        "abstract": "An outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan and spread globally. Recently, it has been reported that discharged patients in China and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering. However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of \u201crelapse\u201d or \u201creinfection\u201d. The longitudinal tracking of re25 exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID35 19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design.",

            "Ethics statement<br/><br/>Four 3- to 5-year old rhesus macaques, named as M1 to M4, were housed and cared in an Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care<br/><br/>Committee (IACUC) of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (BLL20001). All animals were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) prior to sample collection, and the experiments were performed in the animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL3) laboratory.<br/><br/>Animal experiments<br/><br/>For primary infection, all animals were inoculated intratracheally with SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>(SARS-CoV-2/WH-09/human/2020/CHN isolated in our laboratory) stock virus at a dosage of 106 TCID50/1 mL inoculum volume. After the recovery, M3 M4 were rechallenged intratracheally with the same dose (106 TCID50/1 mL inoculum volume)<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 at 28 dpi. To confirm the virus distribution and pathological changes, M1 at 7 dpi and M3 at 33 dpi (5 dpr) were euthanasia and autopsied respectively. All animals were monitored along the timeline to record body weights, body temperature, clinical signs, nasal/throat/anal swab, X-ray and specific antibody. The animal experiment and longitudinal sampling schedule are shown in Figure 1.<br/><br/>Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA<br/><br/>The nasal/throat/anal swab samples and mainly tissue compartments collected from infected monkeys were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcription was performed as previously described7. qRT-PCR reactions were carried out on an ABI<br/><br/>Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems Instrument), the cycling protocol and the primers as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and then 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, 95\u00b0C for 45 s.<br/><br/>Forward primer: 5\u2019-TCGTTTCGGAAGAGACAGGT-3\u2019, Reverse primer: 5\u2019-<br/><br/>GCGCAGTAAGGATGGCTAGT-3\u2019.    ELISA<br/><br/>Sera were collected from each animal for the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) along the detection timeline after the initial infection. 96-well plates were coated with 0.1\u03bcg Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>(Sino Biological, 40591-V08H) overnight at 4\u00b0C and blocked with 2% BSA/PBST for hour at room temperature. 1:100 diluted samples were added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 \u00b0C, followed by the HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Beijing ZSGB Biotechnology, ZB-2305) incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was developed by TMB substrate and determined at 450 nm.<br/><br/>Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry<br/><br/>Autopsies were performed according to the standard protocol in ABSL3 laboratory at dpi for M1 and 5 dpr for M3. Lung samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution. Then, paraffin sections (3-4 \u03bcm in thickness) were prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) prior to the observation by light microscopy. For immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to identify the antigen of<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2, paraffin dehydrated sections (3-4 \u03bcm in thickness) were treated with an antigen retrieval kit (Boster, AR0022) for 1 min at 37\u00b0C and quenched for endogenous peroxidases in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min. After blocking in 1% normal goat serum for 1 hour at roomtemperature, the slices were stained with 7D2 monoclonal antibody (laboratory preparation7) at 4\u00b0C overnight, following with the incubation of<br/><br/>HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Beijing ZSGB Biotechnology, ZDR-5307) for 1 hour. Then, the slices were visualized by incubation with 3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and the image was viewed under an Olympus microscope.<br/><br/>Neutralizing antibody assay<br/><br/>Sera samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibody observed by cytopathic effect (CPE). Briefly, the sera from monkeys were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. Then, serially two-fold diluted sera were incubated with 100 TCID50 SARS-<br/><br/>CoV-2 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, and added into Vero-E6 cells in a 96-well-plate. Cells were cultured for 1 week to observe for CPE and the serum dilution in which 50% of the cells were protected from infection was calculated. Each dilution of serum was tested in triplicates.<br/><br/>Statistical analysis<br/><br/>Comparisons among the groups were determined using One-way ANOVA.

            "The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan China, has continued to sweep through South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran. More than 90,000 people have been infected worldwide, with nearly 3000 deaths in about 40 countries1,2. Since February, it was estimated that about 14% of discharged patients in Guangdong province and elsewhere were testing positive after their release from the hospital and had to return to the hospital for observation3,4. Doubts about whether patients have a risk of \"relapse\" or \"reinfection\" after recovery from initial infection have aroused the worldwide concern.",
            "Therefore, in this study, we used the nonhuman primate models with SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by the same virus rechallenge to ascertain the possibility of reinfection.",
            "Four adult Chinese rhesus macaques (No M1-M4, 3-5 kg, 3-5-year-old) were intratracheally challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at 1\u00d7106 50% tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID50), and the body weight, body temperature, X-ray, sampling of sera, nasal/throat/anal swabs and all primary tissues were carried out on schedule (Figure 1).",
            "Following the initial infection, three of the four monkeys showed the weight loss ranging from 200 g to 400 g (Figure 2a), but the changes of rectal temperature in all the animals were not observed (Figure 2b). Other clinical signs such as reduced appetite, increased respiration rate and hunched posture were transient after the initial challenge.",
            "We next determined their viral loads in respiratory and anal swabs along the timeline after the infection. As shown in Figure 2c and 2d, the viral loads in nasal swabs and pharyngeal swabs reached the highest levels (average, approximately 6.5 log10 RNA copies/mL) at 3 days post-infection (dpi) and then declined naturally. Similarly, viral loads from anal swabs reached the peak about 4.5 log10 RNA copies/mL at 3 dpi and then declined to undetectable level at 14 dpi (Figure 2e). To identify the virus distribution and histopathological changes in SARS-CoV-2 infected monkeys, M1 monkey was euthanized and necropsied at 7 dpi. As shown in Figure 2f (left panel), viral replication was found in nose (107 to 108 copies/mL), pharynx (105 to 106 copies/mL), lung (104 to 107 copies/mL), gut (104 to 106 copies/mL), spinal cord (approximately 104 copies/mL), heart (approximately 104 copies/mL), skeletal muscle (approximately 104 copies/mL) and bladder (approximately 104 copies/mL).",
            "Furthermore, the lesions occurred mainly in the lung confirmed by the HE staining and anti-spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 staining, with mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septa, accumulation of alveolar macrophages in the alveoli, degeneration of the alveolar epithelia, and infiltration of inflammatory cells (Figure 3a). In addition, the chest X-ray at 7 dpi showed that the upper lobe of the right lung had varying degrees of the localized infiltration and interstitial markings, showing the mild to bilateral ground-glass opacification (Represented by M4, Figure 3b). For the longitudinal tracking of the characteristics each monkey, the specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 of M2, M3 and M4 monkey was significantly elevated at 14 dpi or 21 dpi and 28 dpi compared to that at 3 dpi and",
            "7dpi (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, Figure 2g). In the three infected monkeys alive, body weight and rectal temperature remained relatively stable before rechallenge (Figure 2a and 2b), viral loads of nasopharyngeal and anal swabs were not detectable along the timeline before 28 dpi (Figure 2c to 2e), and no common abnormalities were found on a chest",
            "X-ray test at 28 dpi prior to the rechallenge (Represented by M4, Figure 3b). Altogether, these data suggested that the three animals were considered as recovering from SARS-",
            "CoV-2 infection, similarly meeting the clinical discharge evaluation criteria (absence of clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities and 2 negative RT-PCR test results5).",
            "Subsequently, two infected monkeys (M3 and M4) were intratracheally rechallenged at 28 dpi with the same dose (1\u00d7106 TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2 to ascertain the possibility of reinfection, whereas M2 monkey without any re-treatment was continuously monitored as the control (Figure 1). None of the monkeys showed the weight loss after the re-exposure (Figure 2a), but the transient elevation of body temperature was observed in both re-exposed monkeys (Figure 2b). Viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs tested negative after the re-exposure of SARS-CoV-2 along the timeline (Figure 2c to 2e). Correspondingly, M3 monkey was euthanized and necropsied at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) to confirm the viral replication and histopathological changes caused by re-exposure.

            "Recently, it has been reported that discharged patients in China and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering. However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of \u201crelapse\u201d or \u201creinfection\u201d. The longitudinal tracking of reexposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-",

            "The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan China, has continued to sweep through South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran. More than 90,000 people have been infected worldwide, with nearly 3000 deaths in about 40 countries1,2. Since February, it was estimated that about 14% of discharged patients in Guangdong province and elsewhere were testing positive after their release from the hospital and had to return to the hospital for observation3,4. Doubts about whether patients have a risk of \"relapse\" or \"reinfection\" after recovery from initial infection have aroused the worldwide concern.",
            "Therefore, in this study, we used the nonhuman primate models with SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by the same virus rechallenge to ascertain the possibility of reinfection.",
            "Four adult Chinese rhesus macaques (No M1-M4, 3-5 kg, 3-5-year-old) were intratracheally challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at 1\u00d7106 50% tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID50), and the body weight, body temperature, X-ray, sampling of sera, nasal/throat/anal swabs and all primary tissues were carried out on schedule (Figure 1).",
            "Following the initial infection, three of the four monkeys showed the weight loss ranging from 200 g to 400 g (Figure 2a), but the changes of rectal temperature in all the animals were not observed (Figure 2b). Other clinical signs such as reduced appetite, increased respiration rate and hunched posture were transient after the initial challenge.",
            "We next determined their viral loads in respiratory and anal swabs along the timeline after the infection. As shown in Figure 2c and 2d, the viral loads in nasal swabs and pharyngeal swabs reached the highest levels (average, approximately 6.5 log10 RNA copies/mL) at 3 days post-infection (dpi) and then declined naturally. Similarly, viral loads from anal swabs reached the peak about 4.5 log10 RNA copies/mL at 3 dpi and then declined to undetectable level at 14 dpi (Figure 2e). To identify the virus distribution and histopathological changes in SARS-CoV-2 infected monkeys, M1 monkey was euthanized and necropsied at 7 dpi. As shown in Figure 2f (left panel), viral replication was found in nose (107 to 108 copies/mL), pharynx (105 to 106 copies/mL), lung (104 to 107 copies/mL), gut (104 to 106 copies/mL), spinal cord (approximately 104 copies/mL), heart (approximately 104 copies/mL), skeletal muscle (approximately 104 copies/mL) and bladder (approximately 104 copies/mL).",
            "Furthermore, the lesions occurred mainly in the lung confirmed by the HE staining and anti-spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 staining, with mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septa, accumulation of alveolar macrophages in the alveoli, degeneration of the alveolar epithelia, and infiltration of inflammatory cells (Figure 3a). In addition, the chest X-ray at 7 dpi showed that the upper lobe of the right lung had varying degrees of the localized infiltration and interstitial markings, showing the mild to bilateral ground-glass opacification (Represented by M4, Figure 3b).

            "Subsequently, two infected monkeys (M3 and M4) were intratracheally rechallenged at 28 dpi with the same dose (1\u00d7106 TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2 to ascertain the possibility of reinfection, whereas M2 monkey without any re-treatment was continuously monitored as the control (Figure 1). None of the monkeys showed the weight loss after the re-exposure (Figure 2a), but the transient elevation of body temperature was observed in both re-exposed monkeys (Figure 2b). Viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs tested negative after the re-exposure of SARS-CoV-2 along the timeline (Figure 2c to 2e).
