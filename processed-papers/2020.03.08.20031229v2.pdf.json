        "abstract": "In December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. In this case series of 752 patients, the full spectrum of cases is described. Fever was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%). the mortality rate is 4.6% in Wuhan, 1.9% in Beijing, and 0.9% in Shanghai. Our findings showed that the levels of lymphocytes were 0.8(IQR, 0.6-1.1)109/L in Wuhan, 1.0(IQR, 0.7-1.4)109/L in Beijing, and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 109/L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively, indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality. Based on the reference ranges of normal Chinese Han population and the data of the critically ill patients we have observed, it is recommended that reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID-19 infection are CD3+ lymphocytes below 900 cells/mm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], CD4+ lymphocytes below 500 cells/mm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], and CD8+ lymphocytes below 300 cells/mm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",

            "In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As of February 11, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) has officially reported that there are 2.0% (889) asymptomatic cases, 2.3% (1,023) death cases, and 80.9% mild cases among 44,672 confirmed cases. 51.4% (22,981) were male and 48.6% (21,691) were female.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]<br/><br/>In January, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is a distinct clade from the betacoronaviruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 1,2<br/><br/>COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity. Recently, a report shows that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shared the same functional host-cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] Another report shows SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2.8 Since ACE2 receptors on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine are dominant, lung alveolar epithelial cells or enterocytes of the small intestine may be an important susceptibility factor for human.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]<br/><br/>According to World Health Organization interim guidance on January 12, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic case, mild and severe cases of pneumonia, and critical cases of pneumonia (ARDS, sepsis, septic shock). Severe cases of pneumonia are defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or SpO2 < 90% on room air.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Asymptomatic case has been reported in China and Germany.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Huang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] first reported 41 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in which most patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Organ dysfunction (shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury, etc.) and death can occur in severe or critical cases. Guan et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] reported findings from 1099 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and the results suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 infection clustered within groups of humans in close contact, and was more likely to affect older men with comorbidities. However, the full spectrum of disease without comorbidities or related to cellular immune functions is not yet known. The objective of this case series was to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to 14,117 normal controls in Chinese Han population."

            "Study Design and Participants<br/><br/>This retrospective study was done at Chinese PLA General Hospital, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and affiliated hospitals of Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences. We extracted 752 case data in Shanghai (338 cases), and Beijing (414 cases) with clinical confirmed COVID-19 from China CDC. 752 case data were enrolled to be finally analyzed. Main symptoms and laboratory characteristics were from 178 patients surveyed by random sampling. This case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Hospital (#ZS-1830). 14,117 normal controls from health checkup (from November 2018 to November 2019, before COVID-19 outbreak) in Chinese PLA General Hospital, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and affiliated hospitals of Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences were retrospectively enrolled. Identification of patients was achieved by reviewing and analyzing available electronic medical records and patient care resources. Written informed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease. We retrospectively analyzed patients according to WHO interim guidance.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed as previously described.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]<br/><br/>All patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] According to World Health Organization interim guidance on January 12, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic cases, mild and severe cases of pneumonia, and critical cases of pneumonia (ARDS, sepsis, septic shock). Severe case of pneumonia is defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or SpO2 < 90% on room air.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Clinical outcomes (discharges, mortality, and recovery, etc.) were monitored up to March 4, 2020, the final date of follow-up.<br/><br/>Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>A confirmed case of COVID-19 is defined as a positive result on high throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of pharyngeal swab specimens. Samples were collected for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from patients suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection as described previously.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] In brief, the pharyngeal swabs were placed into a collection tube with 150 \u03bcL of virus preservation solution, and total<br/><br/>RNA was extracted within 2 hours using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit.

This includes many types of cancer, and certain chronic virus infections (e.g. cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus). Our findings indicated the PLD at presentation were associated with the severity of disease (Table 3). The severe PLD or the secondary immunodeficiencies (CD4 lymphocytes are below 200 cells/mm3) is common in HIV patients. When CD4 lymphocytes are below 200 cells/mm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], patients with T cell depletion have increased susceptibility to fungal infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]",
            "It has been reported that SARS-CoV directly infects monocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes in human.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] The PLD may also be secondary to activation of T lymphocytes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] Our findings showed that CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes have significant difference (p < 0.01) between mild (Non-ICU) and severe or critical (ICU) cases without glucocorticoid treatment indicating COVID-19 directly effected on immune system is possible.",
            "COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity as SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] The report shows",
            "SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2.8 Therefore, it is necessary to further study whether lymphocytes have ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 expression during the developmental stage since the PLD exists. A SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for lymphocyte subsets in severe or critical cases should be followed up. Our findings also suggest that lymphocyte subsets should be analyzed at admission immediately no matter how COVID-19 affected lymphocytes through directly or indirectly. When patients are confirmed as COVID-19, clinicians should order tests for lymphocyte subsets in order to intervene early in the consequences of the PLD."

        "Conclusions": [
            "In this case series of 752 patients, the full spectrum of cases is described. Fever was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%). The mortality rate is 4.6% in Wuhan, 1.9% in Beijing, and 0.9% in Shanghai. Our findings showed that the levels of lymphocytes were 0.8(IQR, 0.6-1.1)109/L in Wuhan, 1.0(IQR, 0.7-1.4)109/L in Beijing, and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 109/L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively, indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality. Based on the reference ranges of normal Chinese Han population and the data of the critically ill patients we have observed, it is recommended that reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID-19 infection are CD3+ lymphocytes below 900 cells/mm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], CD4+ lymphocytes below 500 cells/mm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], and CD8+ lymphocytes below 300 cells/mm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]."
