        "abstract": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The cardiac injury was dominate in the process. However, whether N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of COVID-19 patients was unknown. The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. Results found that patients with higher NT-proBNP (above 88.64 pg/mL) level had more risks of inhospital death. After adjusting for potential cofounders in separate modes, NT-proBNP presented as an independent risk factor of in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19.",

Despite lower mortality rate, SARS-CoV2 has killed more people than SARS and MERS and the number keeps growing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Epidemic studies have been well described clinical features of patients with COVID19, with the disease severity as an independent predictor of poor outcome[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Investigating prognostic markers for severe patients are required to supply important information for early therapeutic strategy.<br/><br/>A retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 COVID-19 patients study reported that 7.2% and 16.7% patients had complications of acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia respectively[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. The percentage of acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia is even higher in severe patients with 22.2% and 44.4% respectively. The severe patients also showed higher creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and hypersensitive troponin I (hs-TnI) levels than others[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. A latest study also reported cardiac injury of COVID-19 was common in severe patients with the peak value of TnI over 40 folds than normal value[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. However, there is no research concerning whether the heart failure marker, N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of COVID-19 patients."

            "Subjects<br/><br/>The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from a continuous sample in Hubei General Hospital during the management by national medical team. The study is a retrospective, observational registry with clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04292964. All procedures were followed the instructions of local ethic committee (approval NO. 20200701). All the data were collected using a same protocol by well-trained researchers with a double-blind method. Lacking NT-proBNP results (n=45) were excluded. Patients who had stroke (n=2) and acute myocardial infarction (n=1) were excluded. Other inclusion and exclusion criteria were followed the protocol of the registry (NCT04292964). Finally, 54 patients with COVID-19 were studied in this research.<br/><br/>Baseline data and follow-up<br/><br/>Demographic data, clinical features and medical history were available and collected according to the patient record system. Data collection of laboratory results were defined using the first-time examination at admission. All the laboratory data were tested in a same laboratory with the same standard. To observe the risks of in-hospital death, patients were followed up from admission to discharge (1 to 15 days). The primary outcome was in-hospital death defined as the case fatality rate. The follow-up data was collected from reviewing medical records by trained researchers using doubleblind method.<br/><br/>Statistical analysis<br/><br/>Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, frequency (%) or median (interquartile ranges). Intergroup comparisons between NT-proBNP higher group and lower group were made by the independent-samples T-test (normally distributed continuous variables), MannWhitney U test (nonnormally distributed continuous variables) and chi-square test (categorical variables). The best NT-proBNP cut-off was that of the highest product of sensitivity and specificity for in-hospital death prediction. Cumulative survival curves of in-hospital death were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimation method with the log-rank test. Spearman correlation analyzing was used to investigate the coefficients of NT-proBNP with selected covariates. Cox proportional hazards models were used to screening out the potential risk factors and analyzing the independent effect of NT-proBNP on in-hospital death. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and a two-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

            "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China has been declared a public health emergency of international concern[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Despite lower mortality rate, SARS-CoV2 has killed more people than SARS and MERS and the number keeps growing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Epidemic studies have been well described clinical features of patients with COVID19, with the disease severity as an independent predictor of poor outcome[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Investigating prognostic markers for severe patients are required to supply important information for early therapeutic strategy.",
            "A retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 COVID-19 patients study reported that 7.2% and 16.7% patients had complications of acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia respectively[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. The percentage of acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia is even higher in severe patients with 22.2% and 44.4% respectively. The severe patients also showed higher creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and hypersensitive troponin I (hs-TnI) levels than others[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. A latest study also reported cardiac injury of COVID-19 was common in severe patients with the peak value of TnI over 40 folds than normal value[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. However, there is no research concerning whether the heart failure marker, N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of COVID-19 patients."

            "The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from a continuous sample in Hubei General Hospital during the management by national medical team. The study is a retrospective, observational registry with clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04292964. All procedures were followed the instructions of local ethic committee (approval NO. 20200701). All the data were collected using a same protocol by well-trained researchers with a double-blind method. Lacking NT-proBNP results (n=45) were excluded. Patients who had stroke (n=2) and acute myocardial infarction (n=1) were excluded. Other inclusion and exclusion criteria were followed the protocol of the registry (NCT04292964). Finally, 54 patients with COVID-19 were studied in this research.",
            "Demographic data, clinical features and medical history were available and collected according to the patient record system. Data collection of laboratory results were defined using the first-time examination at admission. All the laboratory data were tested in a same laboratory with the same standard. To observe the risks of in-hospital death, patients were followed up from admission to discharge (1 to 15 days). The primary outcome was in-hospital death defined as the case fatality rate. The follow-up data was collected from reviewing medical records by trained researchers using doubleblind method.",
            "Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, frequency (%) or median (interquartile ranges). Intergroup comparisons between NT-proBNP higher group and lower group were made by the independent-samples T-test (normally distributed continuous variables), MannWhitney U test (nonnormally distributed continuous variables) and chi-square test (categorical variables). The best NT-proBNP cut-off was that of the highest product of sensitivity and specificity for in-hospital death prediction. Cumulative survival curves of in-hospital death were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimation method with the log-rank test. Spearman correlation analyzing was used to investigate the coefficients of NT-proBNP with selected covariates. Cox proportional hazards models were used to screening out the potential risk factors and analyzing the independent effect of NT-proBNP on in-hospital death. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and a two-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant."
