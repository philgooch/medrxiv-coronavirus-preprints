        "abstract": "Based on publicly released data for 1212 patients, we investigated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan of China. The following findings are obtained: 1) COVID-19 patients in Henan show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences, possible causes were explored; 2) Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days; Incubation periods of 92% patients were no more than 14 days; 3) The epidemic of COVID-19 in Henan has undergone three stages and showed high correlations with the numbers of patients that recently return from Wuhan; 4) Network analysis on the aggregate outbreak phenomena of COVID-19 revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected, and various people's Hospital are the main force in treating patients. The related investigations have potential implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.",

These abbreviations are similarly hereinafter.",
            "(Fig.2 B). We guess that there are three possible reasons that may result to such gender difference.",
            "Firstly, males may be more active and with wider social activities than females, which increases their risk to infect COVID-19. Secondly and may be the most reasonable, an existing medical investigation reported that the expression and distribution of angiotension converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was wider in male patients than those in females [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Similarly to SARS-CoV, it is reported that COVID-19 invades human body through the ACE2 receptor. Based on single cell RNA sequencing technology, researchers have investigated the expression profiles of ACE2 in two male and six female patients with COVID-19 from single cell resolution, and they found that the expression of ACE2 was correlated with gender. The proportion of ACE2 expressed cells is higher in males than in females (1.66% vs. 0.41%) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Besides, the distribution of ACE2 was also wider in males than that in females. Zhao et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] reported that there were at least five different types of cells in the lungs of males with the expression of the ACE2 receptors, while the number was about 2 \u223c 4 in female patients. This may be one of the deep reasons that why male patients were higher than the female ones. Thirdly, one may doubt that the distribution difference may be caused by population structure. To verify whether the male to female ratio (MFR) affects the finding, based on the statistical yearbook report of Henan province in the year 2019, the MFR in the whole province was 1.0126 : 1, which has great difference with the male to female patients ratio (MFPR)",
            "(637 : 521 = 1.2226 : 1). Moreover, we perform correlation analysis for the two ratios in the 18 regions, the two ratios show very weak correlation, with Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.1555 (Fig.2 C).",
            "Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>] on the MFR and MFPR in the 18 regions also shows that the two have significant difference (KS = 0.6111, p = 0.0018 < 0.05). Thus, we speculate that the MFR has no apparent effect on the MFPR. In conclusion, the former two reasons may be the driven force that there was gender difference in confirmed patients.",
            "The age distribution of patients in the whole province or each region all roughly follows normal distribution (Fig.2 D, E). Patients aged between 21 and 60 years old take up more than 81% (938 out of",
            "1156). The main reason may be that people aged between 21 and 60 years old are the social main labor forces, there are many migrant workers in this age interval. Moreover, they may have wider social circles than the others. Therefore, people aged between 21 and 60 years old are key crowd with high risks of",
            "COVID-19.",
            "Traditionally, incubation period is defined as the period between the infection of an individual by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness or disease it causes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>] . Different infectious diseases have different incubation periods. However, for a certain infectious disease, its incubation period is relatively fixed. Since the number of pathogens entering the body, virulence and reproductive capacity, as well as power of resistance are different for different people, thus, it is reported that the incubation periods obtained from patients for a certain disease should follow logarithm normal distribution [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Generally, incubation period can be measured by physiological observations and biological experiments [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. The determination of incubation period has great implications for disease transmission control and policy making.",
            "The estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19 is a very difficult task. The main difficulty is in that it is difficult to determine the infected time. Based on patients\u2019 information, some works have reported the incubation period of COVID-19. For example, Yang et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] reported that the median incubation period of COVID-19 is 4.75 days; the interquartile range is 3.0 \u2212 7.2 days. Hereinafter, we try to estimate the incubation period of patients in Henan. The collected data are with varied quality, many descriptions of patients only told us when the person left Wuhan, or When she/he had suspicious contacts with persons from Wuhan or suspicious persons (Following, we call they are exposed). To facilitate us to estimate the incubation period, we define estimated incubation period as the period from the date of exposure to the date of appearing clinical symptoms or making a definite diagnosis. Apparently, such definition overestimates the actual incubation period. For example, the information from a patient",

Nodes at the two ends of an edge correspond to the exposed date and the date with clinical symptoms or confirmed infected. Edges represent the transfer from the two dates, and thicknesses of edges are proportional to the numbers of patients. Self-loops mean that the dates for exposure and appearing clinical symptoms or confirmed infected were the same. D. Weighted indegree and outdegree distributions of the directed graph that was shown in C. Weighted indegree denotes the total number of patients with clinical symptoms or confirmed infected; while weighted outdegree represents the total number of exposed persons that will be confirmed to be infected later.",

            "January 6, he and his son were all disease-free for a long period. Until February 3, he became sick and was quickly confirmed with infection of COVID-19. His son was disease-free till now. From our definition of incubation period, his incubation period will be 28 days, which is surprisingly high. We note that, our definition of estimated incubation period may be a little higher than the actually case, since we can not exclude the cases that the person has contacted some other people that carried the COVID-19. That is, we cannot know who was the intermediate spreader (unknown person B), and when she/he transmitted the virus from person A to person C.",
            "Among the collected data, the incubation periods of 483 confirmed patients can be estimated. Statistical results are shown in Fig.3 and Tab.1. The estimated incubation periods for the 483 patients roughly follow the logarithm normal distribution, with a long right tail. Specifically, the 483 confirmed patients were with average estimated incubation period \u03c4D = 7.4 days, the mode was 4 days (50 out of the 483 cases) and the median was 7 days (48 out of the 483 cases). About 55% patients were with incubation periods lower than 7 days, while more than 92% patients were lower than 14 days. About 7.45% patients were overestimated with more than 14 days incubation periods.",
            "Due to the definition, the estimated incubation periods in this paper may be longer than the real cases.",

Since \u03c4 6= 0 in Eq(2.2), we omit the case \u03c4 = 0 (only 29 cases were with \u03c4 = 0). By solving the optimization problem (2.5), we obtain \u03bco = 2.0723, \u03c3o2 = 0.5929.",

The estimated interquartile range from the ME method is [4.1495, 9.3523], which closes to the result from the 483 patients ([<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]).",
            "The theoretical modeling of incubation period further illustrates that the incubation period may follow the logarithmic normal distribution. Moreover, it can be used to estimate the actual statics of incubation periods, and provide valuable references for decision-making.",
            "The epidemic of COVID-19 in Henan has undergone three stages (Fig.3 C and D). For the first stage that before January 13, both exposed and confirmed patients were not so much, the number of exposed (outdegree) ones were more than the confirmed ones (indegree). While for the second stage that between",
            "January 13 and January 23, the COVID-19 was in outbreak period, both exposed and confirmed ones were considerable, and the number of exposed ones are far more than the confirmed ones. During this period, many college students and migrant workers in Wuhan return their hometown, the large number of people flow from Wuhan increased the risks of exposure and infection. After January 23, the epidemic entered the third stage, the number of daily confirmed cases were apparently higher than exposed ones, and the confirmed cases roughly decreased with time. This may be attributed to the adoption of prevention and control measures. With the closing of the Wuhan city at January 23, many regions of Henan quickly adopt very strict measures to prevent the spreading of COVID-19. Thus, after January 23, the number of exposed ones became fewer and fewer (Fig.3 D), which is a good phenomena, indicating that the prevention and control measures become to gradually at work.",
            "For the 18 regions of Henan province, we also summarized the numbers of currently confirmed patients with Wuhan travel histories (denoted as vector X1 ), the numbers of patients without Wuhan travel histories (X2 ), the numbers of patients that have contacts with persons from Wuhan (X3 ), as well as the numbers of patients that are without Wuhan travel histories, but who have contacts with suspicious persons (X4 ). The barplots for the numbers of the four categories of patients in the 18 regions are shown in Fig.4 A (In total of 1149 patients were known with or without Wuhan travel histories). Among patients with Wuhan travel histories, the released information of 250 patients contained transportation information. We found that 46% of the 250 patients have recently traveled by train or by bus, these patients may transmit the COVID-19 to a lot of people that in the same train or bus.",
            "For the 18 regions, we investigate the correlation between the currently total numbers of confirmed patients (Y ) with X1 \u2212 X4 respectively. The heatmap of the correlation matrix is shown in Fig.4C.

            "that between Y and X1 (Fig.4 D-G). This indicates that persons with Wuhan travel histories have high risks of infection with COVID-19, and regions with more such persons tend to encompass more patients infected with COVID-19.",

Among the designated hospitals in Henan province, people\u2019s hospitals in different cities encompass a great number of patients.

        "Discussions and conclusions": [
            "January 21 to February 14 of 2020, we performed statistical analysis on 1212 confirmed patients infected with COVID-19. The number of newly confirmed cases reached its peak at February 3, and it started to fall after that day. Among the 18 regions of Henan, Xinyang is with the heaviest epidemic, and it is currently also with the highest daily increment. We found that 55% patients in Henan were male, which is apparently higher than the females. We found that the gender difference of patients in Henan is 1.2226 : 1, while from Yang et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], they reported that the gender difference for 4021 patients from over 30 provinces is 0.31 : 0.27 = 1.1481 : 1. Our result is close to the existing ones. We reported that the MFRs of the whole province and its 18 regions are not the main factor that results to the gender difference in patients. Two possible main factors that result to such gender difference of patients include",
            "1) the expression and distribution of ACE2s were wider in male patients than those in females, and 2)",
            "males are more active and with wider social activities than females in many regions of Henan. The ages of patients generally follow normal distribution, and with more than 81% patients are aged between 21 and 60 years old.",

            "Incubation period is very important but very difficult to be estimated, since it is difficult to know when the patients were infected. We define the period from firstly contacting with suspicious persons or recently return from Wuhan to firstly appearing clinical symptoms (fever, cough etc) as incubation period, and we estimate its distribution. Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the average estimated incubation period was 7.4 days, the mode was 4 days. About 55% patients were with incubation periods lower than 7 days, while more than 92% patients were lower than 14 days. About 7.45% patients were overestimated with more than 14 days incubation periods. Based on ME, OLS and MLE approaches, we modeled the incubation period as logarithmic normal distributions, and we found the ME method can well mimic the long right tails of the PDF for the incubation periods. Based on the ME approach, interquartile range of theoretically estimated incubation period is between 4.1 and 9.4 days. It is noted that, due to our definition of incubation period, the estimated values are unavoidably higher than the actual cases, however, the distribution and statistics from the estimated incubation periods are undoubtedly meaningful for real-world decision-making.",
            "We also find that the numbers of patients with recent Wuhan travel histories are highly correlated with the total numbers of confirmed cases in the 18 regions of Henan. During our analysis, we consider the linear relationship between Y with each Xi , which mainly for the purpose of avoiding multicollinearity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]",
            "among Xi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). Furthermore, we perform network analysis on aggregate outbreak phenomena of",
