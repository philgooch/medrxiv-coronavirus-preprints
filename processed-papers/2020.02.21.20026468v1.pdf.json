        "abstract": "Background The 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (COVID19) represents a significant public health threat. The COVID-19 emerged in December 2009 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health intervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling.",

The COVID-19 emerged in December 2009 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health intervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling."

            "Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from January 20, 2020 to Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (Rt )<br/><br/>of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty.",
            "2.1. Sources of Data<br/><br/>We obtained the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases of time series data between January 20, 2020 to February 13, 2020 in China from the official websites of the National Health Commission of China and Provincial Health<br/><br/>Committees (http://www.nhc.gov.cn). The data of cases for each of the provinces (24 provinces plus 4 municipalities including Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin) at 23 time points were included, as well as for Wuhan and major cities in Hubei. The start date of January 20 was chosen because the official diagnostic protocol released by WHO on January 17 allows the new COVID-19 cases to be diagnosed accurately and rapidly. The end date of February 13 was chosen is because the diagnosis criteria for Wuhan and<br/><br/>Hubei province were changed to include those identified by clinic diagnosis since February 13. All cases in our study were laboratory-confirmed with the detection of viral nucleic acid following the case definition by the National<br/><br/>Health Commission of China.<br/><br/>Wuhan is connected to other cities in China via high-speed railway, highway, and airplane flights. Population mobility statistics to estimate the exposed sizes in cities outside Wuhan were based on transport-related databases below: 1) Railway and airline travel data: the daily numbers of outbound high-speed trains from Wuhan with corresponding travelling hours were obtained from the high-speed rail network (http://shike.gaotie.cn) from December 1, 2019 to January 23, 2020., and similarly daily numbers of outbound flight and hours for air transport were obtained from the Citytrip network (https://www.ctrip.com) from December 1, 2019 to January 23, 2020. We calculated daily travelling hours which equal to the product of the outbound trip counts and the travelling hours for rail and air transport respectively from Wuhan to each major city. For a given province, we summarized the total number of travelling hours across all cities in that province. 2) Highway mileage data: we collected highway mileage data from bus station networks at https://www.qichezhan.cn. It contains the highway mileage from Wuhan to cities in the Hubei Province. 3) Migration data: we obtained population migration data from the Baidu Migration Map (http://qianxi.baidu.com) which includes the rate of migration among the population leaving Wuhan to other cities and provinces from January 1 to 28, 2020. Total travelling hours for rail and air flight, and migration scales are plotted by the province in Figure 1. Accumulated time on trains, on airplanes, highway mileage and population migration scales were used to model the underlying epidemic sizes in the provinces or cities outside Wuhan at the time 0 of this study which is on January 20, 2020.<br/><br/>From Figure 1, we observed that Guandong has the largest traveling hours through railway and airplane outbound from Wuhan among the provinces.<br/><br/>Also, the largest population has immigrated from Wuhan to Henan. In Hubei province, Cities of Huanggan and Xiaogan are the closest to Wuhan in terms of mileage and the scale of migration. These simple observations are consistent with our result that Guandong, Henan, Huanggan and Xiaogan have the largest number of estimated primary infected cases imported from Wuhan on<br/><br/>January 20, 2020.<br/><br/>2.2.

T Rk and F Lk are constructed based on the two reasons. One is that the longer people stay on the train or plane, the more likely he(she) is to get infected. Another is that the infection happens in local area, hence the number of trains or planes has more information than the population taking trains or planes. In addition, in Hubei province, most people left Wuhan by cars, we use RMk as one of measurement for the spatial distance between city k and Wuhan.<br/><br/>2.2.1. Modeling for 28 provinces<br/><br/>First, we build an index \u03b1k to represent the baseline infected cases in province k on 20 January, 2020. Particularly, we will use T Rk , F Lk and M Ik to measure the relationship between provice k and Wuhan. We suppose \u03b1k \u201c \u03b21 \u02c6 T Rk\u03b22 \u02c6 F Lk\u03b23 \u02c6 M Ik , for province k,    (1)<br/><br/>where \u03b2 \u201c p\u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b23 q1 are estimated by the observed Ykt in provinces k \u201c<br/><br/>1,  \u0308  \u0308  \u0308 , K and t \u201c 1,  \u0308  \u0308  \u0308 , T .<br/><br/>So far, we are not sure the key epidemiological parameters that affected spread and persistence. We hence make assumptions as least as possible.<br/><br/>With the notations defined above, it is obvious that the average new cases in province k at day t is \u03b3kt Wkt . We then assume a Poisson distribution for the new cases diagnosed in province k at day t with mean \u03b3kt Wkt , that is dYkt \u201c Ykt Yk,t1 \u201e P ossionp\u03b3kt Wkt q,    (2)<br/><br/>where \u2018\u201e\u2019 means \u2018distributed as\u2019.<br/><br/>Under the unified leadership of the central goverment, we suppose the trend of \u03b3kt over day t is the same for 28 provinces, that is, \u03b7kt \u201c \u03b7t is independent of k so that \u03b3kt \u201c \u03b7t\u03b3k,t1 .    (3)<br/><br/>To avoid strong assumptions about the evolution of the epidemic, we allow \u03b7t to be arbitray function of t. We determine the functional form of \u03b7t by pointwise estimating \u03b7t and checking the resulting pattern over t. Denote the resulting functional form for \u03b7t by \u03b7t \u201c \u03b7t paq.<br/><br/>Finally, we notice that dWkt \u201c \u03b3kt Wk,t1 , Wkt \u201c Wk,t1 ` dWkt .    (4)    \u015b<br/><br/>With the chain calculation, we have dWkt \u201c \u03b3kt t1 j\u201c0 p\u03b3kj 1qWk0 and Wkt \u201c<br/><br/>\u015bt1 j\u201c0 p\u03b3kj 1qWk0 , where Wk0 \u201c \u03b1k and \u03b3k0 \u201c 0. In practice, the infected patients will be isolated and removed from the infectious source. With the notation m of duration of infectious period, we hence have tpm1q t1 \u017a \u017a    Wkt \u201c<br/><br/>p\u03b3kj 1q\u03b1k Ipt \u0105 mq p\u03b3kj 1q\u03b1k .    j\u201c0<br/><br/>Denote \u03b31 \u201c p\u03b311 ,  \u0308  \u0308  \u0308 , \u03b3K1 q1 and all of the parameters by \u03b4 \u201c p\u03b311 , a1 , \u03b2 1 q1 .<br/><br/>Taken (1), (2), (3) and (5) together, the loglikelihood function was    Lp\u03b4q \u201c    K \u00ff    T \u00ff k\u201c1 t\u201c1    \u00ff \u201c    \u0301    (5)<br/><br/>tdYkt logp\u03bbkt q\u03bbkt u C (<br/><br/>tm dYkt logr\u03b3kt XkT \u03b2 \u03a0t1    p1    `    \u03b3 q<br/><br/>Ipt \u0105 mq\u03a0 s ki ki i\u201c1 i\u201c1 k\u201c1 t\u201c1 \u03b3kt XkT \u03b2 ( \u0306    \u03a0t1<br/><br/>` C, i\u201c1 p1 ` \u03b3ki q Ipt \u0105 mq\u03a0i\u201c1 p1 ` \u03b3ki q (6)<br/><br/>where C is a constant independent of \u03b4, m is determined by minimizing the prediction error. The confidence intervals were obtained based on 200 bootstrap resampling[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].<br/><br/>2.2.2. Modeling for Hubei and Wuhan<br/><br/>The modeling and the loglikelihood function for Hubei are similar with those for 28 provinces except that F Lk is replaced by RMk and provinces are replaced by cities, because there are not flights between the cities in Hubei and Wuhan, and the most people leave Wuhan by cars or buses. Specifically, \u03b1k \u201c \u03b21 \u02c6 T Rk\u03b22 \u02c6 RMk\u03b23 \u02c6 M Ik , for city k in Hubei.    (7)<br/><br/>The modeling and the likelihood function for Wuhan are similar with those for 28 provinces except that \u03b1k is directly estimated by the diagnosed cases in Wuhan.<br/><br/>2.2.3. The calculation of the time-dependent reproduction number Rt<br/><br/>When Wk,t1 \u201c 1, we have \u03b3kt \u201c dWkt . Hence \u03b3kt is the average number of new infections created by an infectious individual in one day, then \u03c6t \u201c<br/><br/>\u0159K k\u201c1 \u03b3kt {K is the corresponding average number across provinces or cities.<br/><br/>Since one infectious individual can make infection for m days, an infectious individual then can lead to Rt \u201c m\u03c6t new infections, which indeed is the time-dependent reproduction number.<br/><br/>In addition, by Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>],! we also )calculate the \u0159 \u03bb 1, where time-dependent reproduction number by Rt \u201c m log \u0159k \u03bbk,t1 k k,t \u03bbk,t \u201c \u03b3kt Wkt .<br/><br/>2.2.4.

            "In early December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, emerged into the human population in Wuhan, the pandemic center, China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The number of SARS-COV-2 infected pneumonia (COVID19) cases has increased rapidly since then in Wuhan. On January 19, 2020, the first case reported in another province was a person who traveled from<br/><br/>Wuhan. From January 23, 2020, a series of substantial public health interventions including travel bans into and from Wuhan, social isolation, quarantine and wearing face masks, have been implemented in Wuhan and subsequently other cities in China such as all 9 localities have successively launched the first-level response to major public health emergencies. As of February 20<br/><br/>(at the time of writing), there have been 75,567 confirmed cases and the death toll stands at 2239 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn), 2-fold greater than what was reported ten days ago, and greatly surpasses the infections and tolls from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003.<br/><br/>For early assessment of the epidemic potential of COVID-19 outbreak and potential effects of government and public health intervention, it is essential to quantify the epidemiological parameters in real-time from a time series data. Using the earlier phase of outbreak data, the basic reproduction number R0 has been estimated to be somewhere between 2.2 to 4.0 in author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.<br/><br/>Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].

The transmissibility depends on the biological properties of the coronavirus, as well as the contact patterns which can be intervened at the national or social levels in populations. The dynamic changes in transmissibility of COVID-19 in Wuhan and across provinces in China remain unknown. We hypothesized that there could be a significant reduction of transmissibility with time which is in accordance with the public health interventions in Wuhan and other provinces.<br/><br/>Here we provide a real-time model-based analysis to estimate trends in transmissibility of COVID-19 from January 20 to February 13 in Wuhan, Hubei and other 28 provinces in China and forecast the turning point to reach a potential outbreak plateau based on the surveillance case counts as well as transportation and population immigration data from Wuhan to other cities. Our method, without relying on an assumption of epidemiological parameters for disease progression which is absent for the novel pathogen in our study, is a flexible and generalizable approach to directly estimate the distribution of the transmissibility trend."

The instantaneous Rt declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1, from January 21 to February 2 in Wuhan, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio for transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27, likely due to the rigorous public health intervention beginning on January 23, 2020. Model prediction results suggested that COVID-19 would be contained in provinces from February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan.",
            "The temporal distributions for Rt give a basis for assessing the evolution of transmissibility over time[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. For Hubei and other provinces, there was an initial growth from January 21 to 27, 2020 with Rt up to 4 followed by a decline in a short period.

Also, almost all provinces initiated the highest level of public health emergency responses during January 23 and 25 including tracking and isolating close contacts with COVID-19 patients, self-quarantine, etc. We speculate that, based on the coincidence of a series of intervention effects, the decline in Rt could be due to a series of intervention measures to reduce the transmission rate implemented since January 23, 2020.",
            "For Wuhan, the reproduction number Rt showed a trend of decline in general from 4.9 to 1 on February 2, 2020, although a slight shift upward on January 27 and 28.

Underreporting is likely to occur which was not accounted for in our analysis. Among all cases reported until February 11, only 13.8% cases were reported prior January 20, 2020 and among them, 77.6% were among the Hubei province[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Since we are most interested in the temporal trend after January 20, the underreporting might not vary greatly with time since then. Second, as there is a series of interventions implemented during subsequent periods, we were not able to distinguish which intervention could be the main driver based on current data. Third, due to the changes in diagnosis, the diagnosed cases increased dramatically up to 14840 in Wuhan and Hubei from February 12, which makes our prediction challenging. Thus we did not provide the predicted cases for Wuhan and Hubei province after February 13, 2020.",
