            "We have conducted statistical modeling analyses on publicly available data to elucidate the asymptomatic proportion, along with the time of infection among the COVID-19 infected cases onboard the Princess Cruises ship.<br/><br/>Our estimated asymptomatic proportion is at 17.9% (95% CrI: 15.5%\u201320.2%), which overlaps with a recently derived estimate of 33.3% (95% CI: 8.3%\u201358.3%) from data of Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Considering the similarity in viral loads and the high possibility of potent transmission potential, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections has significant public health implications [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. For instance, self-isolation for 14- day periods are also recommended for contacts with asymptomatic cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].<br/><br/>Most of the infections appear to have occurred before or around the start of the 2-week quarantine that started on February 5, 2020, which further highlights the potent transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially in confined settings. To further mitigate transmission of COVID-19 and bring the epidemic under control in areas with active transmission, it may be necessary to minimize the number of gatherings in confined settings.<br/><br/>Our study is not free from limitations. First, laboratory tests by PCR were conducted focusing on symptomatic cases especially at the early phase of the quarantine. If asymptomatic cases where missed as a result of this, it would mean we have underestimated the asymptomatic proportion. Second, it is worth noting that the data of passengers and crews employed in our analysis is not a random sample from the general population. Considering that most of the passengers are 60 years and older, the nature of this age distribution may lead to underestimation if older individuals tend to experience more symptoms. An age standardized asymptomatic proportion would be more appropriate in that case. Third, the presence of symptoms in cases with COVID-19 may correlate with other factors unrelated to age including prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immunosuppression. Therefore, more detailed data documenting the baseline health of the individuals including the presence of underlying diseases or comorbidities would be useful to remove the bias in estimates of the asymptomatic proportion.<br/><br/>In summary, we have estimated the proportion of asymptomatic cases among individuals who have tested positive for novel COVID-19 along with the times of infection of confirmed cases onboard the Princess Cruises Ship after adjusting for the delay in symptom onset and right-censoring of the observations."

        "introduction": [
            "Since COVID-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019, thousands of people have succumbed to the novel coronavirus especially in the Province of Hubei while hundreds of imported and secondary cases have been reported in multiple countries as of February 29, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 continue to be investigated as the virus continues its march through the human population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. While reliable estimates of the reproduction number and the death risk associated with COVID-19 are crucially needed to guide public health policy, another key epidemiological parameter that could inform the intensity and range of social distancing strategies to combat COVID-19 is the asymptomatic proportion, which is broadly defined as the proportion of asymptomatic infections among all the infections of the disease. Indeed, the asymptomatic proportion is a useful quantity to gauge the true burden of the disease and better interpret estimates of the transmission potential. This proportion varies widely across infectious diseases, ranging from 8% for measles and 32% for norovirus up to 90-95% for polio [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Most importantly, it is well established that asymptomatic individuals are frequently able to transmit the virus to others [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "COVID-19 is not the exception to this pattern, with accumulating evidence indicating that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus are asymptomatic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. As an epidemic progresses over time, suspected cases are examined and tested for the infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Then, time-stamped counts of the test results stratified according to the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of testing are often reported to the public in near real-time. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the estimation of the asymptomatic proportion needs to be handled carefully since real-time outbreak data are influenced by the phenomenon of right censoring, due to the time lag between the time of examination and sample collection and the development of illness. In this paper, we conduct a statistical modeling analysis to estimate the asymptomatic proportion among infected individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 infections onboard the Princess Cruises Ship along with their time of infections, accounting for the delay in onset of symptoms and right-censoring.",
            "In Yokohama, Japan, an outbreak of COVID-19 unfolded on board the Princess Cruise Ship, which had been under quarantine orders since February 5, 2020, after a former passenger of the cruise ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in Hong Kong. By February 21, 2020, two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end, a total of 634 people including one quarantine officer, one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for COVID-19 out of the 3,711 passengers and crew members on board the vessel. Laboratory testing by PCR were conducted, prioritizing symptomatic or high-risk groups.",
            "Daily time series of laboratory test results for COVID-19 (both positive and negative), including information of presence or absence of symptoms from February 5, 2020 to February 20, 2020 were extracted from secondary sources [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. The reporting date, number of tests, number of tested positive and number of symptomatic and symptomatic cases at the time of sample collection are provided, while the time of infection and true asymptomatic proportion are not available.",
            "A total of 634 people have tested positive among 3063 tests as of February 20, 2020. Out of 634 cases, a total of 313 cases are female and six were aged 0-19 years, were aged 20-59 years and 476 were 60 years and older (Figure 1).

            "The potential infectiousness of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases together with a substantial fraction of asymptomatic infections among all infections, have been highlighted in clinical studies. We conducted statistical modeling analysis to derive the delay-adjusted asymptomatic proportion of the positive COVID-19 infections onboard the Princess Cruises ship along with the timeline of infections. We estimated the asymptomatic proportion at 17.9% (95% CrI: 15.5%\u201320.2%), with most of the infections occurring before the start of the 2-week quarantine.",
            "Since COVID-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019, thousands of people have succumbed to the novel coronavirus especially in the Province of Hubei while hundreds of imported and secondary cases have been reported in multiple countries as of February 29, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 continue to be investigated as the virus continues its march through the human population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. While reliable estimates of the reproduction number and the death risk associated with COVID-19 are crucially needed to guide public health policy, another key epidemiological parameter that could inform the intensity and range of social distancing strategies to combat COVID-19 is the asymptomatic proportion, which is broadly defined as the proportion of asymptomatic infections among all the infections of the disease. Indeed, the asymptomatic proportion is a useful quantity to gauge the true burden of the disease and better interpret estimates of the transmission potential. This proportion varies widely across infectious diseases, ranging from 8% for measles and 32% for norovirus up to 90-95% for polio [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Most importantly, it is well established that asymptomatic individuals are frequently able to transmit the virus to others [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "COVID-19 is not the exception to this pattern, with accumulating evidence indicating that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus are asymptomatic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. As an epidemic progresses over time, suspected cases are examined and tested for the infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Then, time-stamped counts of the test results stratified according to the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of testing are often reported to the public in near real-time. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the estimation of the asymptomatic proportion needs to be handled carefully since real-time outbreak data are influenced by the phenomenon of right censoring, due to the time lag between the time of examination and sample collection and the development of illness. In this paper, we conduct a statistical modeling analysis to estimate the asymptomatic proportion among infected individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 infections onboard the Princess Cruises Ship along with their time of infections, accounting for the delay in onset of symptoms and right-censoring."

        "Discussion": [
            "We have conducted statistical modeling analyses on publicly available data to elucidate the asymptomatic proportion, along with the time of infection among the COVID-19 infected cases onboard the Princess Cruises ship.",
            "Our estimated asymptomatic proportion is at 17.9% (95% CrI: 15.5%\u201320.2%), which overlaps with a recently derived estimate of 33.3% (95% CI: 8.3%\u201358.3%) from data of Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Considering the similarity in viral loads and the high possibility of potent transmission potential, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections has significant public health implications [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. For instance, self-isolation for 14- day periods are also recommended for contacts with asymptomatic cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "Most of the infections appear to have occurred before or around the start of the 2-week quarantine that started on February 5, 2020, which further highlights the potent transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially in confined settings. To further mitigate transmission of COVID-19 and bring the epidemic under control in areas with active transmission, it may be necessary to minimize the number of gatherings in confined settings.",
            "Our study is not free from limitations. First, laboratory tests by PCR were conducted focusing on symptomatic cases especially at the early phase of the quarantine. If asymptomatic cases where missed as a result of this, it would mean we have underestimated the asymptomatic proportion. Second, it is worth noting that the data of passengers and crews employed in our analysis is not a random sample from the general population. Considering that most of the passengers are 60 years and older, the nature of this age distribution may lead to underestimation if older individuals tend to experience more symptoms. An age standardized asymptomatic proportion would be more appropriate in that case. Third, the presence of symptoms in cases with COVID-19 may correlate with other factors unrelated to age including prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immunosuppression. Therefore, more detailed data documenting the baseline health of the individuals including the presence of underlying diseases or comorbidities would be useful to remove the bias in estimates of the asymptomatic proportion.",
            "In summary, we have estimated the proportion of asymptomatic cases among individuals who have tested positive for novel COVID-19 along with the times of infection of confirmed cases onboard the Princess Cruises Ship after adjusting for the delay in symptom onset and right-censoring of the observations.",
