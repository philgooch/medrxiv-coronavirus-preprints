        "abstract": "Abstract \nBackground In December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province.\nMethods In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. \nResults Forty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were high fever and cough. Majority of patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all the patients. Thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock. A total of 20 (44.4%) patients required intubation and 9 (20%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As of February 28th 2020, only one patient (2.2%) had died and half of them had discharged of ICU.\nConclusions Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in critical illness is characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction. Compared with critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, the mortality of critically ill patients in Guangdong Province was relatively low. These data provide some general understandings and experience for the critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan.",

            "The study presented a multi-center cohort of 45 patients admitted to ICUs for SARS-CoV-2 infection out of Wuhan. The findings showed that the majority of the patients were seriously ill at ICU admission. Of all included patients, 37 (82.2%) had developed ARDS, 20 (44.4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 9 (20.0%) required ECMO, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe illness.<br/><br/>Our study population might represent most of the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 90% of critically ill patients, which was similar in Wuhan cohort [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Moreover, we found that intubated patients had significantly lower lymphocyte counts than without intubation. Chi-square test had shown lower lymphocyte counts was more likely to be at high risk for intubation. Spearman correlation analyses showed that lymphocyte count was significantly negatively correlated with SOFA score at ICU admission. In fact, lymphocytopenia was common in viral pneumonia, particular in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. It was reported that lymphocyte < 0.8*109/L was an independent risk factor for 90-day mortality of viral pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Therefore, lymphocytopenia may reflect the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dynamic monitoring lymphocyte would be of clinical benefit for intensive caring the critical illness."

        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "The study presented a multi-center cohort of 45 patients admitted to ICUs for SARS-CoV-2 infection out of Wuhan. The findings showed that the majority of the patients were seriously ill at ICU admission. Of all included patients, 37 (82.2%) had developed ARDS, 20 (44.4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 9 (20.0%) required ECMO, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe illness.",
            "Our study population might represent most of the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 90% of critically ill patients, which was similar in Wuhan cohort [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Moreover, we found that intubated patients had significantly lower lymphocyte counts than without intubation. Chi-square test had shown lower lymphocyte counts was more likely to be at high risk for intubation. Spearman correlation analyses showed that lymphocyte count was significantly negatively correlated with SOFA score at ICU admission. In fact, lymphocytopenia was common in viral pneumonia, particular in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. It was reported that lymphocyte < 0.8*109/L was an independent risk factor for 90-day mortality of viral pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Therefore, lymphocytopenia may reflect the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dynamic monitoring lymphocyte would be of clinical benefit for intensive caring the critical illness.",
            "Although antiviral drugs, including osehamivir and ribavirin had been applied to our patients, to date no effective antiviral to treat COVID-19 has been identified. The current approach to clinical management is general supportive care supplemented with critical care and organ support when necessary. It has been suggested that the administration of high-titer anti-influenza immune plasma derived from convalescent or immunized individuals may be clinically beneficial for the treatment of SARS, MERS and seasonal influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Convalescent plasma was a potential treatment in coronavirus infection and suggested using in COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Therefore, convalescent plasma of COVID-19 was applied in 6 patients (13.3%) and no transfusion reactions occurred in our cohort. However, according to our data, at this point, our findings could not provide valuable information in the efficacy of convalescent plasma in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection due to limited sample sizes, short time observation and lack of randomized controlled group. Thus, treatment of current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particular in critical illness, via convalescent plasma should be carefully considered before well-designed clinical trials are conducted.",
            "According to Berlin definition, a total of 37 (82.2%) patients had developed ARDS. The respiratory distress and hypoxemia were difficult to treat with an overall hospital mortality of 46.1% in severe ARDS according Lung Safe Study [25]. In our cohort, 20 patients (44.4%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Recruitment maneuvers, prone position ventilation, CRRT and ECMO were also applied for management of ARDS. In addition, many of our patients developed extrapulmonary organ dysfunction including sepsis shock, acute liver dysfunction, and acute renal injury. As of February 28, 2020, the mortality of our critically ill cases of COVID-19 were 2.2% (1 of 45) in our cohort, which was lower than those (61.5%, 32 of 52) in Wuhan. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 led to more than 65,000 infected patients in Wuhan (CCDC report on February 28, 2020). The massive infux of patients, inadequately protective clothing and medical personnel, particularly in critical care resources, may account for the unacceptable high mortality in Wuhan. In contrast, protective clothing and medical personnel could cover the relative less patients in Guangdong Province. In addition, a well design Web-based video consultation system for critically ill patients with COVID-19 was established and applied across different cities in Guangdong Province. Then specialists in critical care medicine could share their experience and help the management of the critical illness in a remote way across hospitals and cities. Moreover, aggressive treatments and intensive care were applied for the severe patients, including convalescent plasma, invasive mechanical ventilation, CRRT, ECMO. Therefore, the mortality was relatively lower in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province. Limitation",
            "Our study has several limitations. Firstly, only 45 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included from Guangdong Province. It might be that more clinical features related to those critically illness will be identified, if other provinces get involved. Secondly, at the time of study submission, half of the patients had not been discharged from ICU, so we are unable to estimate either ICU stay, ventilation free day, the case fatality rate or the predictors of fatality."
        ],
        "Conclusions": [
            "Compared with the ICU mortality of patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection in Wuhan, those of patients from Guangdong Province in our study had lower mortality (1 of 45, 2.2%). Currently, it is necessary for intensively supporting and carefully monitoring of the critical illness before effective drugs and vaccines to be developed against SARS-Cov-2 infection.",
