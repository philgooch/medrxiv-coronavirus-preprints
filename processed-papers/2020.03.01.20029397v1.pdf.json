            "In December 2019, COVID-19 firstly occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to worldwide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. On January 30, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency due to this rapid infection spreads. However, as one of the major cities imported passengers from Wuhan in China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], the regional characteristics of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality were not reported so far. Our presents study, to our knowledge, firstly portrayed the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, laboratory characteristics, treatment regimens and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Chongqing municipality, China. And we further compared the numerous differences between severe and non-severe patients in Chongqing municipality. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing municipality is 1.5%, approximately consistent with the official fatality rate 0.91%, lower than the 28-day mortality of mainland China including Hubei province (2.51% [1770/70548]), reported by national official statistics as for February 16th, 2020<br/><br/>Recently, there are some studies described the cases of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan or worldwide. First study including 41 cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, in which most patients had a direct history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market of Wuhan, with high mortality rate (6/41, 15%) in this study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. An extended descriptive study from 99 cases in the same hospital further revealed the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 in Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Another study from 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan found that 26% of patients received intensive care unit (ICU) care and further compared the differences between severe cases received ICU care with non-severe cases who did not receive ICU care[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Two more researches including COVID-19 cases based on the big data from the whole country delineated the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in nationwide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. The clinical courses and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients was recently reported[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. In our study, the majority critically severe patients are older and male, consistent with gender difference in previous researches[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The high susceptibility of males is similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Although, only few of patients in Chongqing are smokers, more severe cases are smokers. Previous study demonstrated that the gene expression of ACE2, receptor of 2019-nCov, is significantly higher in smoker's lung. ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and actively expressed in remodeled AT2 cells of smokers. Thus, smoking history may indicate a poor prognosis due to its different infection paths with non-smokers[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Compared with patients who had a definite direct exposure to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the epidemics in Chongqing has transmitted to the coexistence of imported cases and local sporadic or clustered cases. As the strong epidemic control in Hubei was implemented, clustered cases or family aggregation cases gradually compose the majority of confirmed cases in Chongqing. Although small part of patients in Chongqing had coexisting chronic disease, relatively less frequent than that of patients in Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], severe patients were more likely to suffer from underlying comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases), resulting in the deficiency in innate and adaptive immunity of these patients. Among the common comorbidities, we found a significant portion of patients in Chongqing suffered from overweight and obesity, which is more common in severe patients. Obesity-induced chronic inflammation status is well documented to contribute to the progress of multiple diseases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Large epidemiological studies have shown that BMI was associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and length of hospital stay, which has already been used in lung injury prediction score (LIPS) to help physicians identify at-risk patients for developing ALI19. Therefore, elderly male patients with a history of smoke and underlying comorbidities are at increased risk of becoming critically severe if they are suffered from COVID-19 infection, which deserves more attention and intensive care treatment. As the sequence of 2019-nCoV showing 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV, and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV20, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection bear resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. Dominant symptoms at onset of COVID-19 in Chongqing were still fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and myalgia or arthralgia is more common in the Chongqing patients. The absence of fever, especially hyperpyrexia, may increase the difficulty to identify and diagnosis COVID-19 in clinical practice if too much attention was given to fever detection only. Moreover, in our study, a significant proportion of patients in Chongqing initially developed with atypical symptoms, such as upper respiratory tract symptoms (eg, nasal congestion and pharyngalgia) and gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, anorexia, diarrhea and nausea), and even had no obvious symptoms, which is inconsistent with previous study reporting upper respiratory tract and intestinal signs and symptoms are rare in Wuhan province[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Therefore, the atypical patients and asymptomatic carriers deserves more attention to avoid delayed or missed diagnosis. Moreover, rales and wheezes are scarcely noted when lung auscultation was performed, due to the lack of sputum or mucus, especially for non-severe patients. Further comparison between the severe and non-severe patients found that severe patients are more likely to suffer from dyspnea and confusion symptoms on disease onset, which may suggest severe complications such as respiratory failure or septic shock, and is of great value of early identification of critically severe cases. The median durations from symptoms onset to laboratory diagnosis and hospital admission were 4 days and 7 days, with obvious longer time for severe cases, which may lead to the poor outcome due to delayed medical interventions. In general, COVID-19 in severe cases progresses rapidly to lethal complications (ARDS, septic shock, acute cardiac injury, refractory metabolic acidosis and so on), even leading to death. Our study demonstrates that the median interval from symptoms onset to ARDS of severe cases was much shorter than that of non-severe cases. It has been demonstrated that poor populations always endured a disproportionate burden of disease and death from infectious diseases like influenzas[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. A great number of death cases in our study were poorly-educated elders with chronic comorbidities, their illness deteriorated rapidly to severe ARDS within several days, presented as suddenly occurred severe hypoxaemia, malignant arrhythmia, cardiac and respiratory arrest, unfortunately death, despite of timely rescue including invasive ventilation and other advanced medical interventions. Therefore, early diagnosis and management of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially poorly-educated elderly male with chronic comorbidities, should be vigorously advocated. Regarding to laboratory tests, consistent with most reports, peripheral lymphocytopenia is the most crucial and common feature for COVID-19 infection. In our study, most patients suffered from varying degrees of lymphocytopenia, especially for critically severe patients. Lymphocytopenia is also a prominent feature for patients with SARS-CoV, H1N1, MERS-CoV virus infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Progressive lymphopenia is reported to occurred early in the course of SARS and reached its lowest point in the second week in most patients, then, lymphocytes count commonly recovered in the third week[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. In terms of lymphocyte subsets, the counts of total T cells, CD4 positive and CD8 positive T cells had reduced in COVID-19 patients on admission. Counts of total T cells and CD3 positive T cells were significantly lower among severe patients, accompanied by an obvious declining tendency in CD8 positive T cells, indicating an adverse outcome. Pathological findings from the biopsy of COVID-19 death patient implied that overactivation of T cells, manifested by increase of highly proinflammatory Th17 and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, partially accounts for the severe immune injury in death patient[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. The phenomenon that T cell counts reduced and functionally exhausted has been reported in previous study, which indicates high risk for further deterioration of COVID-1927. In our study, a progressive decline of lymphocytes and CD4 positive T cells was observed during the deterioration of illness. Thus, the dynamic profile of lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets are of great value for disease progression and outcomes prediction. Early studies have shown that 2019-nCoV infection increased the release of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines from T-helper-1 (Th1) and T-helper-2(Th2) cells, differing from SARS or MERS-infection induced proinflammatory cytokines secretion[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Our study demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17A were elevated in mostly patients, with significant higher level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-\u03b1 in severe patients, indicating an underlying relationship between pulmonary inflammation and lung damage in 2019-nCoV patients. So far, the cytokines storm\u2019s effects on viral pneumonia are considerable complex and their clinical roles in severe lung injury have not been extensively documented, therefore, further investigations are needed to elucidate immune and inflammation response in 2019-nCoV pathogenesis, which is of crucial importance for efficient treatments. Few of patients presented as elevated levels of infectious parameters, but other abnormalities were less common. While, severe patients obviously manifested more prominent abnormalities, suggesting multiple organ dysfunction and poor outcomes. Additionally, severe cases suffered from lower albumin and hemoglobin, suggesting the importance of nutrition supportive treatments. As for radiologic presentations, more attention should be paid to the cases without obvious radiological abnormalities on admission, so as to avoid the miss or delayed diagnosis. Therefore, it is crucial important to take symptoms, laboratory findings, radiologic findings into account to make an integrated and thorough judgment. The MuLBSTA score, an efficient early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>], needs further validation in the future practice.<br/><br/>Currently, no specific treatment available has been advocated for coronavirus infection. As most of patients in Chongqing were non-severe, antiviral therapy was commonly adopted among these patients. Empirical antibiotic therapy was merely administered to few patients with bacterial infection evidence, and ordinary oxygen therapy was supplied only if hyoxemia occurred. As for the severe cases, comprehensive treatment is important. Mechanical ventilation is the main respiratory supportive treatment for critically ill patients, which should be administered as soon as possible if the normal oxygenation cannot maintain. Treatments were focused on supportive therapy, which focuses on limiting further lung damages through a combination of lung-protective ventilation to prevent ventilator-associated lung injury and conservative fluid therapy to prevent the hyperpermeability of alveolar endothelial and epithelial barriers and promote lung edema resorption. Although, systematic corticosteroid treatment is not routinely recommended for COVID-19 patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], while based on the pathological findings of COVID-19 biopsy that pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>], low dosage of intravenous methylprednisolone (usually 20-80mg for 3-5 days) was still provided to some severe patients at early stage of the illness to suppress lung inflammation and hasten radiographic improvement. Immunopotentiator and \u03b3-immunoglobulin should be administered to enhance immune responses and pathogen clearance based on the patient\u2019s condition. Notably, traditional Chinese medicine formulae was extensively utilized in critically severe patients after precise and professional evaluation. Two discharged COVID-19 patients promised to donate convalescent plasma for critically severe patients\u2019 further treatment. Previous Meta-Analysis reported that patients with H5N1 influenza pneumonia who received influenza-convalescent human blood products may have experienced a reduction in the risk for death[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. Convalescent plasma may reduce the mortality of SARS coronavirus and severe influenza infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. On the contrary, high-titre anti-influenza plasma was reported to confer no significant benefit over non-immune plasma for treating patients with severe influenza A34. Transfusion of convalescent plasma into 84 patients with Ebola virus disease was not associated with a significant improvement in survival[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Therefore, it is still too early to judge the efficiency of these therapy, much more studies are still needed In summary, our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients in Chongqing municipality, China. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing municipality is 1.5%, approximately consistent with the official fatality rate 0.91%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. Early isolation, early diagnosis, early management, combined with the strong epidemic control in Hubei and the effective prevention of local cluster outside Hubei might collectively contribute to the marked reduced 28 day-mortality in Chongqing municipality. However, for severe patients, the 28-mortality was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Thus, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality."

            "53.1% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31 [68.9%] vs 20 [39.2%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b3, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%], 35 [52.2%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-\u03b1 was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2%] vs 15 [51.7%], 25 [65.8%] vs 10 [34.5%], 17 [44.7%] vs 5 [17.2%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%). Conclusion: Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality."

        "Discussion": [
            "In December 2019, COVID-19 firstly occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to worldwide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. On January 30, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency due to this rapid infection spreads. However, as one of the major cities imported passengers from Wuhan in China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], the regional characteristics of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality were not reported so far. Our presents study, to our knowledge, firstly portrayed the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, laboratory characteristics, treatment regimens and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Chongqing municipality, China. And we further compared the numerous differences between severe and non-severe patients in Chongqing municipality. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing municipality is 1.5%, approximately consistent with the official fatality rate 0.91%, lower than the 28-day mortality of mainland China including Hubei province (2.51% [1770/70548]), reported by national official statistics as for February 16th, 2020",
            "Recently, there are some studies described the cases of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan or worldwide. First study including 41 cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, in which most patients had a direct history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market of Wuhan, with high mortality rate (6/41, 15%) in this study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. An extended descriptive study from 99 cases in the same hospital further revealed the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 in Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Another study from 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan found that 26% of patients received intensive care unit (ICU) care and further compared the differences between severe cases received ICU care with non-severe cases who did not receive ICU care[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Two more researches including COVID-19 cases based on the big data from the whole country delineated the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in nationwide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. The clinical courses and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients was recently reported[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. In our study, the majority critically severe patients are older and male, consistent with gender difference in previous researches[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The high susceptibility of males is similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Although, only few of patients in Chongqing are smokers, more severe cases are smokers. Previous study demonstrated that the gene expression of ACE2, receptor of 2019-nCov, is significantly higher in smoker's lung. ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and actively expressed in remodeled AT2 cells of smokers. Thus, smoking history may indicate a poor prognosis due to its different infection paths with non-smokers[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Compared with patients who had a definite direct exposure to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the epidemics in Chongqing has transmitted to the coexistence of imported cases and local sporadic or clustered cases. As the strong epidemic control in Hubei was implemented, clustered cases or family aggregation cases gradually compose the majority of confirmed cases in Chongqing. Although small part of patients in Chongqing had coexisting chronic disease, relatively less frequent than that of patients in Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], severe patients were more likely to suffer from underlying comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases), resulting in the deficiency in innate and adaptive immunity of these patients. Among the common comorbidities, we found a significant portion of patients in Chongqing suffered from overweight and obesity, which is more common in severe patients. Obesity-induced chronic inflammation status is well documented to contribute to the progress of multiple diseases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Large epidemiological studies have shown that BMI was associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and length of hospital stay, which has already been used in lung injury prediction score (LIPS) to help physicians identify at-risk patients for developing ALI19. Therefore, elderly male patients with a history of smoke and underlying comorbidities are at increased risk of becoming critically severe if they are suffered from COVID-19 infection, which deserves more attention and intensive care treatment. As the sequence of 2019-nCoV showing 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV, and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV20, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection bear resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. Dominant symptoms at onset of COVID-19 in Chongqing were still fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and myalgia or arthralgia is more common in the Chongqing patients. The absence of fever, especially hyperpyrexia, may increase the difficulty to identify and diagnosis COVID-19 in clinical practice if too much attention was given to fever detection only. Moreover, in our study, a significant proportion of patients in Chongqing initially developed with atypical symptoms, such as upper respiratory tract symptoms (eg, nasal congestion and pharyngalgia) and gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, anorexia, diarrhea and nausea), and even had no obvious symptoms, which is inconsistent with previous study reporting upper respiratory tract and intestinal signs and symptoms are rare in Wuhan province[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Therefore, the atypical patients and asymptomatic carriers deserves more attention to avoid delayed or missed diagnosis. Moreover, rales and wheezes are scarcely noted when lung auscultation was performed, due to the lack of sputum or mucus, especially for non-severe patients. Further comparison between the severe and non-severe patients found that severe patients are more likely to suffer from dyspnea and confusion symptoms on disease onset, which may suggest severe complications such as respiratory failure or septic shock, and is of great value of early identification of critically severe cases. The median durations from symptoms onset to laboratory diagnosis and hospital admission were 4 days and 7 days, with obvious longer time for severe cases, which may lead to the poor outcome due to delayed medical interventions. In general, COVID-19 in severe cases progresses rapidly to lethal complications (ARDS, septic shock, acute cardiac injury, refractory metabolic acidosis and so on), even leading to death. Our study demonstrates that the median interval from symptoms onset to ARDS of severe cases was much shorter than that of non-severe cases. It has been demonstrated that poor populations always endured a disproportionate burden of disease and death from infectious diseases like influenzas[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. A great number of death cases in our study were poorly-educated elders with chronic comorbidities, their illness deteriorated rapidly to severe ARDS within several days, presented as suddenly occurred severe hypoxaemia, malignant arrhythmia, cardiac and respiratory arrest, unfortunately death, despite of timely rescue including invasive ventilation and other advanced medical interventions. Therefore, early diagnosis and management of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially poorly-educated elderly male with chronic comorbidities, should be vigorously advocated. Regarding to laboratory tests, consistent with most reports, peripheral lymphocytopenia is the most crucial and common feature for COVID-19 infection. In our study, most patients suffered from varying degrees of lymphocytopenia, especially for critically severe patients. Lymphocytopenia is also a prominent feature for patients with SARS-CoV, H1N1, MERS-CoV virus infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Progressive lymphopenia is reported to occurred early in the course of SARS and reached its lowest point in the second week in most patients, then, lymphocytes count commonly recovered in the third week[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. In terms of lymphocyte subsets, the counts of total T cells, CD4 positive and CD8 positive T cells had reduced in COVID-19 patients on admission. Counts of total T cells and CD3 positive T cells were significantly lower among severe patients, accompanied by an obvious declining tendency in CD8 positive T cells, indicating an adverse outcome. Pathological findings from the biopsy of COVID-19 death patient implied that overactivation of T cells, manifested by increase of highly proinflammatory Th17 and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, partially accounts for the severe immune injury in death patient[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. The phenomenon that T cell counts reduced and functionally exhausted has been reported in previous study, which indicates high risk for further deterioration of COVID-1927. In our study, a progressive decline of lymphocytes and CD4 positive T cells was observed during the deterioration of illness. Thus, the dynamic profile of lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets are of great value for disease progression and outcomes prediction. Early studies have shown that 2019-nCoV infection increased the release of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines from T-helper-1 (Th1) and T-helper-2(Th2) cells, differing from SARS or MERS-infection induced proinflammatory cytokines secretion[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Our study demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17A were elevated in mostly patients, with significant higher level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-\u03b1 in severe patients, indicating an underlying relationship between pulmonary inflammation and lung damage in 2019-nCoV patients. So far, the cytokines storm\u2019s effects on viral pneumonia are considerable complex and their clinical roles in severe lung injury have not been extensively documented, therefore, further investigations are needed to elucidate immune and inflammation response in 2019-nCoV pathogenesis, which is of crucial importance for efficient treatments. Few of patients presented as elevated levels of infectious parameters, but other abnormalities were less common. While, severe patients obviously manifested more prominent abnormalities, suggesting multiple organ dysfunction and poor outcomes. Additionally, severe cases suffered from lower albumin and hemoglobin, suggesting the importance of nutrition supportive treatments. As for radiologic presentations, more attention should be paid to the cases without obvious radiological abnormalities on admission, so as to avoid the miss or delayed diagnosis. Therefore, it is crucial important to take symptoms, laboratory findings, radiologic findings into account to make an integrated and thorough judgment. The MuLBSTA score, an efficient early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>], needs further validation in the future practice.",
            "Currently, no specific treatment available has been advocated for coronavirus infection. As most of patients in Chongqing were non-severe, antiviral therapy was commonly adopted among these patients. Empirical antibiotic therapy was merely administered to few patients with bacterial infection evidence, and ordinary oxygen therapy was supplied only if hyoxemia occurred. As for the severe cases, comprehensive treatment is important. Mechanical ventilation is the main respiratory supportive treatment for critically ill patients, which should be administered as soon as possible if the normal oxygenation cannot maintain. Treatments were focused on supportive therapy, which focuses on limiting further lung damages through a combination of lung-protective ventilation to prevent ventilator-associated lung injury and conservative fluid therapy to prevent the hyperpermeability of alveolar endothelial and epithelial barriers and promote lung edema resorption. Although, systematic corticosteroid treatment is not routinely recommended for COVID-19 patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], while based on the pathological findings of COVID-19 biopsy that pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>], low dosage of intravenous methylprednisolone (usually 20-80mg for 3-5 days) was still provided to some severe patients at early stage of the illness to suppress lung inflammation and hasten radiographic improvement. Immunopotentiator and \u03b3-immunoglobulin should be administered to enhance immune responses and pathogen clearance based on the patient\u2019s condition. Notably, traditional Chinese medicine formulae was extensively utilized in critically severe patients after precise and professional evaluation. Two discharged COVID-19 patients promised to donate convalescent plasma for critically severe patients\u2019 further treatment. Previous Meta-Analysis reported that patients with H5N1 influenza pneumonia who received influenza-convalescent human blood products may have experienced a reduction in the risk for death[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. Convalescent plasma may reduce the mortality of SARS coronavirus and severe influenza infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. On the contrary, high-titre anti-influenza plasma was reported to confer no significant benefit over non-immune plasma for treating patients with severe influenza A34. Transfusion of convalescent plasma into 84 patients with Ebola virus disease was not associated with a significant improvement in survival[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Therefore, it is still too early to judge the efficiency of these therapy, much more studies are still needed In summary, our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients in Chongqing municipality, China. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing municipality is 1.5%, approximately consistent with the official fatality rate 0.91%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. Early isolation, early diagnosis, early management, combined with the strong epidemic control in Hubei and the effective prevention of local cluster outside Hubei might collectively contribute to the marked reduced 28 day-mortality in Chongqing municipality. However, for severe patients, the 28-mortality was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Thus, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality."
