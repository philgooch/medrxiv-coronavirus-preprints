        "abstract": "The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.",

            "Main Text 2019-nCoV is the etiological agent of the current rapidly growing outbreak originating from Wuhan, Hubei province, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. At the end of December 2019, 41 cases of \u2018pneumonia of unknown etiology\u2019 were reported by the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. On January 1, 2020, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which was determined to be the epicenter of the outbreak, was closed. Seven days later, the causative agent of new disease was formally announced by China CDC as 2019-nCoV. Human-to-human transmission was later reported, i.e. infection of medical workers reported by the news and infection of individuals with no recent history of Wuhan visit [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. In response, China CDC upgraded the emergency response to Level 1 (the highest level) on January 15. By January 21, 2019-nCoV infection had spread to most of the other provinces. On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down/quarantined, all transportations into and out of the city and all mass gatherings was canceled. However, the number of confirmed cases has continued to increase exponentially since January 16 (Fig. 1A and B). On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] . As of February 5, 2020, the virus outbreak lead to more than 24,000 total confirmed cases and 494 deaths, and the virus has spread to 25 countries. Initial estimates of the growth rate of the outbreak based on early case count data in Wuhan and international flight data up to mid-January were 0.1 per day (a doubling time between 6-7 days) and a basic reproductive number, R0 (defined as the average number of secondary cases an index case infects when it is introduced in a susceptible population), of 2.2 and 2.7 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]; however, the rates of growth in the number of confirmed cases during late January (Fig. 1A and B) suggest a doubling time much shorter than 6-7 days.",
            "Here, with more up-to-date and high-resolution datasets across China until the end of January, we estimated that the exponential growth rate and R0 are much higher than these previous estimates. We improved on previous estimates in three distinct ways. First, we used an expanded dataset of individual case reports based on our collection and direct translations of documents published daily from official health commissions across provinces and special municipalities in China (see Data Collection in Supplementary Materials). Second, we integrated high-resolution real-time domestic travel data in China. Third, to address the issue of potential data collection and methodological bias or incomplete control of confounding variables, we implemented two distinct modeling approaches using different sets of data. These analyses produced estimates of the exponential growth rates that are consistent with one another and higher than previous estimates."
