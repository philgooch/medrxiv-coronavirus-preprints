        "abstract": "Background: China has been severely affected by COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) since December, 2019. This study aimed to assess the population mental health burden during the epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors. Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regressions were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem. Results: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people (P<0.001). Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep quality (P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and times to focus on the COVID-19 (\u2265 3 hours per day)",

        "introduction": [
            "COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019, also known as 2019-nCoV), a cluster of acute respiratory illness with unknown causes, occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China since December 2019 (Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, 2020; Paules et al, 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2020_a\">Wang et al, 2020</a>). As of February 15, 2020, a total of 66,580 COVID-19 cases in China have been confirmed and 1,524 Chinese died from the disease.<br/><br/>Internationally, sporadic cases exported from Wuhan were reported in 25 countries (such as 334 cases in Japan, and 67 cases in Singapore), 5 continents, and 1 international conveyance (218 cases in \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d) (World Health<br/><br/>Organization, 2020a). On January 23, Wuhan city closed all access routes to stop the spread of disease. Seven days later, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)<br/><br/>(World Health Organization, 2020b).<br/><br/>In addition to causing physical damage, COVID-19 also has a serious impact on the mental health of the public. In January 20, China confirmed human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 and some medical staff in Wuhan have been infected (XINHUANET, 2020). Since then, the public has shown anxiety-related behaviors, causing a significant shortage of medical masks and alcohol across the country. On the night of January 31, due to a news release that \u201cShuanghuanglian\u201d oral liquid could suppress COVID-19 (People's daily of China, 2020), the public rushed to pharmacies overnight to buy this drug. In addition, many front-line medical staff work more than 16 hours a day on average, causing them to not get enough sleep.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a 37-year-old Japanese government worker who was in charge of isolated returnees from Wuhan was found to have died from apparent suicide (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThe_2020_a\" href=\"#rThe_2020_a\">The<br/><br/>Japan Times, 2020</a>).<br/><br/>Evidence indicated that COVID-19 is a distinct clade from the betacoronaviruses related to human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Zhu et al, 2020). Several studies showed that mental author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.<br/><br/>health problems could occur in both healthcare workers and SARS survivors during the SARS epidemic (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2007_a\">Lee et al, 2007</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLu_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rLu_et+al_2006_a\">Lu et al, 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMcalonan_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rMcalonan_et+al_2007_a\">McAlonan et al, 2007</a>).<br/><br/>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorders were the most prevalent long-term psychological condition (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMak_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rMak_et+al_2009_a\">Mak et al, 2009</a>). Similar results have been reported in the previous study of MERS (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2018_a\">Lee et al, 2018</a>). Based on the above research evidence, we have reason to speculate that the psychological condition of the public may also be affected during COVID-19 epidemic.<br/><br/>Therefore, using a web-based cross-sectional study, we aimed to assess the mental health burden of Chinese population during COVID-19 epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors. We hope our study findings will provide data support for the targeted interventions on psychological health in Chinese population during the epidemic."

        "discussion": [
            "Our web-based study show a high prevalence of GAD and poor sleep quality in the<br/><br/>Chinese population during COVID-19 epidemic. Anxiety symptoms were more likely to occur in people younger than 35 years and those who spent too much time focusing on the epidemic. Compared with other professions, healthcare workers were associated with higher risk for poor sleep quality. Our findings provided data support for accurately understand the source of public\u2019s panic during COVID-19 epidemic.<br/><br/>The data in this study suggested public\u2019s levels of anxiety-related symptoms increase when a major infectious diseases occurred. Similar to the psychological burden caused by SARS (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSu_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rSu_et+al_2007_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSu_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rSu_et+al_2007_a\">Su et al, 2007</a></a>), we found that one in three participants showed anxiety disorders, and this mood was not different between male and female during COVID-19 epidemic, which was different from previous research that women were more likely to have anxiety than men (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGuo_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rGuo_et+al_2016_a\">Guo et al, 2016</a>; Gao et al, 2020). In addition, nearly one in five participants had depressive symptoms and sleep problems, indicating that the uncertainty of the epidemic progression would cause greater psychological pressure on the public. The possible reason for these mental problems may be related to the \u201chypochondriac concerns\u201d (worry about being infected) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFurer_et+al_1997_a\" href=\"#rFurer_et+al_1997_a\">Furer et al, 1997</a>) and feared that the epidemic was hard to control.<br/><br/>After multivariate logistic regression analyses, we found that age and times to focus on COVID-19 may be potential risk factors for the psychological problems of the public. Younger participants (< 35 years) were more likely to develop anxiety and depressive symptoms during COVID-19 epidemic than older participants (\u2265 35 years).<br/><br/>Our results were similar to those of a previous study in Taiwan during SARS outbreak (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSu_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rSu_et+al_2007_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSu_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rSu_et+al_2007_a\">Su et al, 2007</a></a>). In addition, we assessed the average time participants spent focusing on the COVID-19 epidemic each day, and found that people who spent too much time on the epidemic (\u2265 3 hours) were more likely to develop anxiety symptoms. The manifestation of this panic mood may be related to the body\u2019s normal protective response to the stress caused by the epidemic (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMaunder_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rMaunder_et+al_2003_a\">Maunder et al, 2003</a>).<br/><br/>Since January 20, 2020, Zhong Nanshan (the renowned Chinese respiratory expert who discovered the SARS virus) confirmed that there must be human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 (XINHUANET, 2020), more than 20,000 medical staff gave up the Spring Festival holiday and voluntarily applied to support the epidemic in<br/><br/>Hubei Province (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). Meanwhile, most healthcare workers in China have returned to work to cope with the further development of the disease. Our findings showed that nearly one in four healthcare workers have sleep problems, which was significantly higher than other occupational group. One possible reason is that the working intensity and time of healthcare workers will increase in the face of severe epidemic (such as SARS and<br/><br/>MERS), resulting in them not having enough time to rest, and prone to chronic stress and psychological distress (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLu_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rLu_et+al_2006_a\">Lu et al, 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2018_a\">Lee et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMcalonan_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rMcalonan_et+al_2007_a\">McAlonan et al, 2007</a>).<br/><br/>In severe cases, a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms may even occur, which is highly correlated with poor sleep (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKobayashi_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rKobayashi_et+al_2007_a\">Kobayashi et al, 2007</a>).<br/><br/>Fortunately, the Chinese government has taken many strong national measures in time to avoid further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, including requiring uninfected people to isolate themselves at home, prohibiting all gathering activities, and forcing everyone to wear medical masks to enter public places. However, there is still lack of relevant research on the targeted intervention of the public\u2019s psychological problems during the COVID-19 epidemic. We filled this research gap by analyzing the prevalence of psychological issue in Chinese population stratified by demographic characteristics and exploring related influential factors. Several appropriate interventions are recommended as follows: First, particular effect should be direct to vulnerable populations which include the suspected and diagnosed patients, young people, and healthcare workers, especially physicians and nurses working directly with patients or quarantined people. Second, try to control the time of receiving relevant information no more than two hour every day, focus only on the necessary information (such as facts and data) and avoid receiving too many harmful rumors (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGrein_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rGrein_et+al_2000_a\">Grein et al, 2000</a>). Third, maintain normal work and rest as much as possible, exercise regularly to promote sleep quality, and do not pay too much attention to epidemic information before going to sleep.<br/><br/>This study has several limitations. First, the data and relevant analyses presented here were derived from a cross-sectional design, it is difficult to make causal inferences. Second, the study was limited to COVID-19 epidemic, we used web-based survey method to avoid possible infections. However, this leading to the sampling of our study was voluntary and conducted by online system. Therefore, the possibility of selection bias should be considered. Third, due to the sudden occurrence of the disaster, we were unable to assess an individual\u2019s psychiatric conditions before the outbreak."
