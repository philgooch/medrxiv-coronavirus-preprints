            "The infectious agent driving the ongoing pneumonia outbreak (the 2019-nCoV) appears to have transitioned from animals into humans at Huanan seafood wholesale market in<br/><br/>Wuhan, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Since then, cases have been recorded in other countries, and initial estimates suggest a case fatality rate of around 14% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Even countries without confirmed cases are on high alert. For example, the United Kingdom has not yet seen a confirmed case, but officials are reported to be attempting to trace as many as 2,000 visitors that have travelled to that country from Wuhan.<br/><br/>The most devastating infectious disease outbreaks are those that have a wide geographical distribution, as opposed to being confined to a small region [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. The previously known virus that is most similar to the 2019-nCoV is the SARS coronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], which generated cases in 37 countries in 2002-03 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Since the 2019-nCoV is clearly author/funder. It is made available under a CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license.<br/><br/>capable of being transmitted by infected hosts to countries around the world, an important question for policy makers is whether or not these imported cases have the potential to generate sustained human-to-human transmission in new locations.<br/><br/>Here, we present data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients from the current outbreak, obtained from publicly available line lists [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. We fit an exponential distribution to these data, accounting for uncertainty due to the limited numbers of patients from whom data were available. Assuming that this distribution characterises the time spent by infected hosts generating new transmissions in the community, it is then possible to infer the probability that a case arriving in a new location is followed by an outbreak driven by sustained human-to-human transmission. We estimate this probability under the assumption that the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and then go on to consider the effect of shortening the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation. This provides an estimate of the risk that imported cases generate sustained outbreaks in new locations under different surveillance levels."

            "Time from symptom onset to hospitalisation<br/><br/>The distribution of times from symptom onset to hospitalisation was estimated using patient data from the ongoing outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] (data are shown in Fig 1A). Since the precise times of symptom onset and hospitalisation on the dates concerned were unknown, we converted the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation to intervals describing possible time periods. For example, for a case showing symptoms on 9 January 2020, and then being hospitalised on 14 January 2020, the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation lies between four and six days (see e.g. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] for a similar calculation).<br/><br/>We then fitted the parameter (\u03b3) of an exponential distribution to these interval-censored data using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A chain of length 100,000,000 in addition to a burn-in of 100,000 was used. The chain was then sampled every 100 steps, giving rise to a range of n = 1,000,000 equally possible distributions for the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation, each characterised by a parameter estimate \u03b3\" (i = 1,2, . . . , n).<br/><br/>Estimating the probability of sustained transmission<br/><br/>The distributions of times from symptom onset to hospitalisation were used to estimate the probability that an imported case will lead to sustained transmission, by assuming that infections occur according to a branching process (e.g. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]). In this branching process, the effective reproduction number (accounting for control interventions, other than intensified surveillance which we model explicitly) of the 2019-nCoV when the virus arrives in a new location is denoted by R = \u03b2/\u03b3, where the parameter \u03b2 represents pathogen transmissibility [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>].

            "USA. Fortunately, there has not yet been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.005. This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a large global epidemic.",

Even countries without confirmed cases are on high alert. For example, the United Kingdom has not yet seen a confirmed case, but officials are reported to be attempting to trace as many as 2,000 visitors that have travelled to that country from Wuhan.",

The previously known virus that is most similar to the 2019-nCoV is the SARS coronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], which generated cases in 37 countries in 2002-03 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].

We fit an exponential distribution to these data, accounting for uncertainty due to the limited numbers of patients from whom data were available. Assuming that this distribution characterises the time spent by infected hosts generating new transmissions in the community, it is then possible to infer the probability that a case arriving in a new location is followed by an outbreak driven by sustained human-to-human transmission. We estimate this probability under the assumption that the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and then go on to consider the effect of shortening the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation.
