Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups were analyzed. Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6 and IL-10. Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in severe patients. T cell subsets and cytokines can be used as one of the basis for predicting the transition from mild to severe. Large number of samples are still needed to confirm the \"warning value\" of CD4 + T, CD8 + T IL-6 and IL-10. Key words: 2019 novel coronavirus; lymphocyte subsets; cytokines; mild; severe",

All patients were confirmed to be positive for new coronavirus nucleic acid by real-time fluorescent RT-PCR. Patients were diagnosed according to the World Health Organization interim guidance for NCP and divided into mild and severe (including severe and critical) groups    Blood sampling<br/><br/>Blood samples of the patients were collected by the nurse according to the doctor's order, and all patients were not treated before the blood sampling or did not receive the standardized treatment according to the diagnosis and treatment scheme of NCP.<br/><br/>Lymphocyte subsets detection<br/><br/>Two test tubes were taken for each patient, and were numbered A and B respectively. 5 \u03bcL of<br/><br/>CD3/ CD8/ CD45/ CD4 antibody (Beijing Tongshengshidai Biotechnology Co., Ltd) was added to the tube A and 5 \u03bcL of CD16 + 56/ CD45/ CDl9 antibody was added to tube B. After adding 50 \u03bcL of EDTA anticoagulant whole blood to each tube, the tubes were vortexed and kept at room temperature for 15 minutes in the dark. Then the samples were detected by four-color fluorescence labeled flow cytometry (Mindray BriCyte E6; Mindray, Shenzhen, China).<br/><br/>Cytokine detection<br/><br/>The detection reagent of cytokine was provided by Qingdao Raisecare Biotechnology Co., Ltd (calibrator lot number: 20190801). Six cytokines including IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF and IFN were detected by multiple microsphere flow immunofluorescence according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After the blood sample and the corresponding flow tube be numbered 101, 102, 103, 104, and 105, EDTA-K2 anticoagulant whole blood was centrifuged at 2365 r / min for 30 min.<br/><br/>Then 25 \u03bcL of experimental buffer, 25 \u03bcL of centrifuged plasma, 25 \u03bcL of capture microsphere antibody, and 25 \u03bcL of detection antibody were added to the corresponding flow tube. After incubating at room temperature for 2 hours in the dark with gentle shaking, 25 \u03bcL SA-PE was added into the flow tube respectively, and then incubation was continued for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the diluted wash buffer (1:10) was added to the flow tube. After a few seconds of vortex shaking, the flow tube was centrifuged at 1500r / min for 5 minutes, the liquid was slowly poured out, and the flow tube was inverted on the absorbent paper. Then 100 \u03bcL of diluted washing buffer (1:10)<br/><br/>was added to the flow tube according to the requirements of the flow cytometer, and the test was performed after shaking for 10 seconds.<br/><br/>Statistical analysis<br/><br/>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).<br/><br/>Descriptive analyses were performed for categorical variables such as gender. Continuous variables such as inspection results were expressed as  x \u00b1 s and compared using the independent samples ttest. Correlation analysis results were expressed by Pearson correlation coefficient and a larger r2 indicates better linear correlation. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant."

        "discussion": [
            "Lymphocyte subsets play an important role in the body's cellular immune regulation, and each cell restricts and regulates each other. This study found that among NCP patients, the reduction rate of CD4 + T accounted for 52.90% in the mild group, and 95.24% in the severe group; the reduction rate of CD8 + T accounted for 28.40% in the mild group, and 61.90% in the severe group, indicating that T lymphocytes were more inhibited in severe patients when the body is resistant to 2019-nCoV infection. This was consistent with the research conclusions of Huabiao Chen[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] in SARS coronavirus, revealing that the body responds in the same way when coping with homologous coronavirus infection. The reduction ratio of B cell was 25.49% and 28.57% in the mild group and the severe group, respectively, with no significant difference. The reduction ratio of NK cells accounted for<br/><br/>34.31% in the mild group and 47.62% in the severe group, which suggested that 2019-nCoV infection limited the activity of NK cells to a certain extent, and in view of the fact that immune adjuvant IL-2 can improve the activity of NK cells, the above research results may provide new ideas and evidence for clinical treatment. 3<br/><br/>Chaolin Huang et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] showed that the levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-<br/><br/>1, MIP-1A were significantly higher in 2019-nCoV infected patients in ICU than those in non-ICU patients, and the incidence of ARDS, secondary infection, shock, acute heart, and kidney injury was significantly higher in patients with ICU than in non-ICU patients. The results of this study indicated that 21 patients in the severe group had IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF within normal values. TNF and<br/><br/>IFN mainly secreted by Th1 cells and NK cells were not significantly different between the mild and severe groups. In the mild group, 55.88% of the patients had IL-6 detection value of 0, and<br/><br/>30.39% of the patients had IL-6 detection value higher than the normal value. The reason remains to be elucidated, which may be related to the inhibition of Th2 cells involved in humoral immunity in the early stage of infection. However, the proportion of IL-6 above normal was 76.19% in the severe group, which was significantly higher than that in the mild group. This is in line with the concept of \"Cytokine Storm\", which must be experienced by patients with mild illness to become severe, emphasized by Lanjuan Li, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. In addition, in the course of diagnosis and treatment, the Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital noticed that monitoring the changes of cytokines during the treatment process is of certain significance to optimize the treatment plan and predict the outcome of the disease.<br/><br/>The results of this study suggested that there was no significant linear correlation between lymphocyte subsets and cytokines. By analyzing the differences of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in peripheral blood between the mild and severe patients, we found that only CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 had statistical significance between the mild and severe groups, suggesting that the immunosuppression of severe patients with 2019-nCoV infection was more obvious, which was consistent with the opinions of many experts.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] For several results of this study, for example, the proportion of patients with an IL-6 value of 0 in the mild group was as high as 55.88%, there was no significant difference in terms of IL-17, TNF, IFN, and IL-4 between the two groups of patients, both B cell and NK cell decreased in different degrees in two groups of patients, the possible reasons are as follows. (1)The conclusion of this study is a true reflection of the characteristics of 2019-nCoV itself; (2) In the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection, due to the strong variability and good concealment of the virus, it cannot be quickly recognized by the body; (3)<br/><br/>2019-nCoV releases certain special factors after entering the body and interferes with the body's initiation of a specific immune response; (4) Other reasons that have not yet been confirmed.<br/><br/>This study has several limitations. Firstly, as the largest diagnosis and treatment center for patients with NCP in Chongqing area, our hospital has more than 123 patients so far. The sample size was relatively small compared with Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some impact on the statistical results. But on the whole, the number of patients in this area was in the middle level for other parts of the country except Wuhan, and the research results were relatively reliable. Secondly, the humoral immunity level of the included patients was not monitored, so there was a certain deficiency in the evaluation of the immune system. Thirdly, due to the large-scale outbreak of the epidemic restricting the flow of people, data on healthy patients are lacking as blank controls.<br/><br/>In future studies, data will be collected from healthy patients as blank controls to further explore the predictive value of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines for patients with<br/><br/>2019-nCoV infection. At the same time, we will cooperate with other designated treatment units to carry out multicenter research to include more confirmed 2019-nCoV infected patients, expand the sample size, and design more rigorous randomized controlled trials. In addition, we will strengthen the follow-up of patients who are cured and discharged, and regularly detect the patient's peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines."

        "Discussion": [
            "Lymphocyte subsets play an important role in the body's cellular immune regulation, and each cell restricts and regulates each other. This study found that among NCP patients, the reduction rate of CD4 + T accounted for 52.90% in the mild group, and 95.24% in the severe group; the reduction rate of CD8 + T accounted for 28.40% in the mild group, and 61.90% in the severe group, indicating that T lymphocytes were more inhibited in severe patients when the body is resistant to 2019-nCoV infection. This was consistent with the research conclusions of Huabiao Chen[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] in SARS coronavirus, revealing that the body responds in the same way when coping with homologous coronavirus infection. The reduction ratio of B cell was 25.49% and 28.57% in the mild group and the severe group, respectively, with no significant difference. The reduction ratio of NK cells accounted for",
            "34.31% in the mild group and 47.62% in the severe group, which suggested that 2019-nCoV infection limited the activity of NK cells to a certain extent, and in view of the fact that immune adjuvant IL-2 can improve the activity of NK cells, the above research results may provide new ideas and evidence for clinical treatment. 3",
            "Chaolin Huang et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] showed that the levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-",
            "1, MIP-1A were significantly higher in 2019-nCoV infected patients in ICU than those in non-ICU patients, and the incidence of ARDS, secondary infection, shock, acute heart, and kidney injury was significantly higher in patients with ICU than in non-ICU patients. The results of this study indicated that 21 patients in the severe group had IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF within normal values. TNF and",
            "IFN mainly secreted by Th1 cells and NK cells were not significantly different between the mild and severe groups. In the mild group, 55.88% of the patients had IL-6 detection value of 0, and",
            "30.39% of the patients had IL-6 detection value higher than the normal value. The reason remains to be elucidated, which may be related to the inhibition of Th2 cells involved in humoral immunity in the early stage of infection. However, the proportion of IL-6 above normal was 76.19% in the severe group, which was significantly higher than that in the mild group. This is in line with the concept of \"Cytokine Storm\", which must be experienced by patients with mild illness to become severe, emphasized by Lanjuan Li, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. In addition, in the course of diagnosis and treatment, the Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital noticed that monitoring the changes of cytokines during the treatment process is of certain significance to optimize the treatment plan and predict the outcome of the disease.",
            "The results of this study suggested that there was no significant linear correlation between lymphocyte subsets and cytokines. By analyzing the differences of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in peripheral blood between the mild and severe patients, we found that only CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 had statistical significance between the mild and severe groups, suggesting that the immunosuppression of severe patients with 2019-nCoV infection was more obvious, which was consistent with the opinions of many experts.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] For several results of this study, for example, the proportion of patients with an IL-6 value of 0 in the mild group was as high as 55.88%, there was no significant difference in terms of IL-17, TNF, IFN, and IL-4 between the two groups of patients, both B cell and NK cell decreased in different degrees in two groups of patients, the possible reasons are as follows. (1)The conclusion of this study is a true reflection of the characteristics of 2019-nCoV itself; (2) In the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection, due to the strong variability and good concealment of the virus, it cannot be quickly recognized by the body; (3)",
            "2019-nCoV releases certain special factors after entering the body and interferes with the body's initiation of a specific immune response; (4) Other reasons that have not yet been confirmed.",
            "This study has several limitations. Firstly, as the largest diagnosis and treatment center for patients with NCP in Chongqing area, our hospital has more than 123 patients so far. The sample size was relatively small compared with Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some impact on the statistical results. But on the whole, the number of patients in this area was in the middle level for other parts of the country except Wuhan, and the research results were relatively reliable. Secondly, the humoral immunity level of the included patients was not monitored, so there was a certain deficiency in the evaluation of the immune system. Thirdly, due to the large-scale outbreak of the epidemic restricting the flow of people, data on healthy patients are lacking as blank controls.",
            "In future studies, data will be collected from healthy patients as blank controls to further explore the predictive value of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines for patients with",
            "2019-nCoV infection. At the same time, we will cooperate with other designated treatment units to carry out multicenter research to include more confirmed 2019-nCoV infected patients, expand the sample size, and design more rigorous randomized controlled trials. In addition, we will strengthen the follow-up of patients who are cured and discharged, and regularly detect the patient's peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines."
