        "abstract": "Background: A range of case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates for COVID-19 have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age- and location-based underascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual line-list data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9\u201319.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1-24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%-3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 / 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39%-1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age. Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk.",

            "Background<br/><br/>A range of case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates for COVID-19 have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age- and location-based underascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual line-list data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9\u201319.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1-24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%-3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 / 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39%-1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age. Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk."

            "As of 3rd March 2020, 90,870 cases and 3,112 deaths of the disease COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus had been reported worldwide1. To date, the majority of these (80,422 cases and 2,946 deaths) have been reported from mainland China with a geographic focus in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province. However, in recent days the rate of increase in cases has been greatest outside China. At present, substantial outbreaks are occurring in the Republic of Korea (4,812 cases), Iran (1,501 cases) and Italy (2,036 cases). However, geographic expansion of the epidemic continues, with cases now reported from all continents1.<br/><br/>Clinical studies conducted on hospitalised cases show that the onset of COVID-19 is associated with symptoms commonly associated with viral pneumonia, most commonly fever, cough/sore throat and myalgia/fatigue2\u20136. The case definition adopted in China and elsewhere includes further stratification of cases as severe (defined as tachypnoea (\u226730 breaths/ min) or oxygen saturation \u226493% at rest, or PaO2/FIO2 <300 mmHg) and critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, septic shock or other organ dysfunction/failure that requires intensive care)7. According to the WHO/China Joint Mission Report, 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases in China up to 20 February 2020 have mild-tomoderate disease \u2013 including both non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases; whilst 13.8% developed severe disease and 6.1% developed to a critical stage requiring intensive care8. In a study of clinical progression in 1,099 patients4, those at highest risk for severe disease and death included people over the age of 60 years and those with underlying conditions (including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer)."

            "Data<br/><br/>Individual-level data on early deaths from mainland China<br/><br/>We identified information on the characteristics of 48 cases who died from COVID-19 infection in Hubei Province reported by the National Health Commission and the Hubei Province Health Commission website20,21. We recorded the following data elements where available: gender, age, date of symptoms onset, date of hospitalisation, and date of death. Of the 48 cases, neither the date of symptom onset nor the date of report was available for 13 cases. We further removed 8 cases with onset before 01/01/2020 or death before 21/01/2020, and 3 deaths after 28/01/2020 which were the dates consistent with reliable reporting of onset and death in this setting, respectively. This left 24 deaths, which we used to estimate the onset-to-death distribution.<br/><br/>Individual-level data on cases outside mainland China",
            "Time intervals between symptom onset and outcome<br/><br/>During a growing epidemic, a higher proportion of the cases will have been infected recently (Figure S1). We accounted for this by re-parameterising a Gamma model to account for exponential growth using a growth rate of 0.14 per day obtained from the early case onset data (see Supplementary Methods). Using Bayesian methods, we fitted a Gamma distributions to data on times from onset-todeath and onset-to-recovery conditional on having observed the final outcome. Missing onset dates were imputed based on dates of report where available.<br/><br/>Estimates of the CFR, IFR and proportion hospitalised from aggregated case data<br/><br/>To estimate the CFR using aggregated data we used our estimates of the distribution of times from onset-to-death to project the expected cumulative number of deaths given the onsets observed in Wuhan and outside Wuhan. We began by assuming that the attack rate is uniform across age-groups (i.e. all ages are equally susceptible). Using the age-distribution of the population, for a given attack rate, we therefore obtained an estimate of the expected infections in each age-group. Underascertainment was then estimated inside and outside Wuhan by comparing observed cases by age to this expected distribution assuming perfect ascertainment in the 50-59 age-group. For Wuhan, we added an additional scaling (fitted using a Binomial likelihood) to account for further underascertainment compared to outside Wuhan (given the over-stretched health system). These steps gave us the expected age-distribution of cases."

            "Figure 2A shows the subset of 24 deaths from COVID-19 that occurred in mainland China early in the epidemic. During a growing epidemic, we are more likely to observe shorter times from onset-todeath because those that occur later will not yet have been reported. Correcting for this bias, we estimate the mean time from onset-to-death to be 18.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 15.7-49.7 days) with a coefficient of variation, CV, of 0.45 days (95% crI 0.29-0.54 days). With the limited number of observations in these data and given that they were from early in the epidemic, we could not exclude many deaths occurring with longer times from onset-to-death (hence the high upper credible interval). However, given that the epidemic in China has since declined, our posterior estimate of the mean time from onset-to-death informed by the analysis of aggregated China data is more precise (mean 17.8 days, 95% crI 16.9-19.2 days, Figure 2).<br/><br/>We similarly estimated the mean time from onset-to-recovery using data on outcomes in 169 cases reported outside mainland China. We obtain a slightly longer duration for the onset-to-recovery distribution of 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1-24.4 days) and CV of 0.33 days (95% crI 0.30-0.37 days) (Figure 2)."

            "Based on extensive analysis of data from different regions of the world, our best estimate at the current time for the CFR of COVID-19 in China is 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%-1.53%). Whilst this remains lower than estimates for other coronaviruses including SARS27 and MERS28, it is substantially higher than estimates from the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic29\u201331. Our estimate of an IFR of 0.66% in China was informed by PCR-testing of international Wuhan residents returning on repatriation flights. This is consistent with the IFR observed to date in passengers on the Princess Diamond Cruise ship. Our 8<br/><br/>estimates of the probability of requiring hospitalisation assume that only severe cases clinically require hospitalisation. This is clearly different from the pattern of hospitalisation that occurred in China, where hospitalisation was also used to ensure case isolation. Mortality can also be expected to vary with the underlying health of specific populations, given that the risks associated with COVID-19 will be heavily influenced by the presence of underlying co-morbidities."

            "Assessing the severity of COVID-19 is critical to determine both the appropriateness of mitigation strategies and to enable planning for healthcare needs as epidemics unfold.

Firstly, there can be a period of two to three weeks between a case developing symptoms, subsequently being detected and reported and observing the final clinical outcome. During a growing epidemic the final clinical outcome of most of the reported cases is typically unknown. Simply dividing the cumulative reported number of deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases will therefore underestimate the true CFR early in an epidemic9\u201311. This effect was observed in past epidemics of respiratory pathogens \u2013 including SARS12 and H1N19 influenza \u2013 and as such is widely recognised. Thus, many of the estimates of the CFR that have been obtained to date for COVID-19 correct for this effect13\u201316. Additionally, however, during the exponentially growing phase of an epidemic, the observed time-lags between the onset of symptoms and outcome (recovery or death) are censored and na\u00efve estimates of the observed times from symptoms onset to outcome provide biased estimates of the actual distributions. Ignoring this effect tends to bias the estimated CFR downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemic.",
            "Secondly, surveillance of a newly emerged pathogen is typically biased towards detecting clinically severe cases, particularly at the start of an epidemic when diagnostic capacity is limited (Figure 1). Estimates of the CFR may thus be biased upwards until the extent of clinically milder disease is determined9. Data from the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, China have primarily been detected through hospital surveillance and hence are likely to represent moderate or severe illness, with atypical pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress being used to define suspected cases eligible for testing7. In these individuals, clinical outcomes are likely to be more severe, and therefore any 3",
            "estimates of the CFR will be higher. Elsewhere in mainland China and outside, countries and administrative regions alert to the risk of infection being imported via travel initially instituted surveillance for COVID-19 with a broader set of clinical criteria for defining a suspected case. These typically include a combination of symptoms (e.g. cough and fever) combined with recent travel history to the affected region (Wuhan and/or Hubei Province)2,17. Such surveillance is therefore likely to detect clinically milder cases but, by initially restricting testing to those with a travel history or link, may have missed other symptomatic cases. More recently, as epidemics have taken off in other countries, cases are now being detected in those with no reported travel links to Wuhan/Hubei province through broader surveillance systems. Some of these cases may represent a milder level of severity \u2013 including secondary cases identified via contact-tracing or those identified through sentinel surveillance of influenza-like-illness at primary care18,19. In contrast, others will represent the severe end of the disease spectrum with an increasing number identified through hospital surveillance (for example, testing of viral pneumonia) or in a few cases, at post-mortem analysis.",
            "Quantifying the extent of infection overall in the population (including those infected with either mild, non-specific symptoms or who are asymptomatic, as depicted in the bottom of Figure 1) requires random population surveys of infection prevalence. Serological assays provide the best option for obtaining this denominator; however, robust assays are not currently available. The only such data providing an assessment of the level of infection in a subset of the population not presenting with symptoms at present is therefore the PCR infection prevalence surveys conducted in international residents of Wuhan that have been repatriated to their home country.",
            "Here we attempt to adjust for these biases in data sources to obtain estimates of the CFR (proportion of all cases that will eventually die) and infection fatality ratio (IFR, the proportion of all infections that will eventually die) using both individual-level case report data and aggregate case and death counts from mainland China, administrative regions and international case reports. By adjusting for both underlying demography and potential under-ascertainment at different levels of the severity pyramid (Figure 1), these estimates should be broadly applicable across a range of settings to inform health planning whilst more detailed case data accrue."

        "Methods": [
            "We identified information on the characteristics of 48 cases who died from COVID-19 infection in Hubei Province reported by the National Health Commission and the Hubei Province Health Commission website20,21. We recorded the following data elements where available: gender, age, date of symptoms onset, date of hospitalisation, and date of death. Of the 48 cases, neither the date of symptom onset nor the date of report was available for 13 cases. We further removed 8 cases with onset before 01/01/2020 or death before 21/01/2020, and 3 deaths after 28/01/2020 which were the dates consistent with reliable reporting of onset and death in this setting, respectively. This left 24 deaths, which we used to estimate the onset-to-death distribution.",
            "We collated data on 2,010 cases reported from 37 countries and two administrative regions of China (Hong Kong and Macau) from Government (and/or) Ministry of Health websites and media reports up to 25th February 2020. We recorded the following information where available: country or administrative region in which the case was detected, whether the infection was acquired in China or abroad, date of travel, date of symptom onset, date of hospitalisation, date of confirmation, date of recovery, and date of death. We used data from 169 recovered individuals with reported recovery dates and reported/imputed onset dates to estimate the onset to recovery distribution. We used data on 1,334 international cases to obtain estimates of the CFR.",
            "Data on 70,117 PCR-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases by date of onset in Wuhan and elsewhere in China from 1st January to 11th February 2020 were extracted from the WHO Joint Mission Report8. Over this time-period a cumulative total of 1,023 deaths were reported across China, with these data available disaggregated into ten-year age bands between 0-9 and 70-79 years old and those above 80 years old7. Using collated data on daily reported deaths obtained each day from the National Health Commission regional websites21, we estimate that 74% of deaths occurred in Wuhan and the remainder outside Wuhan. Additionally, the most recent available cumulative estimates (March 3rd 2020) of 80 304 confirmed cases and 2,946 deaths within China were extracted from COVID-19 WHO Situation Report #431.",
            "An earlier pre-print of a subset of these cases up to 26th January 2020 reported the age-distribution of cases categorised by severity for 3,665 cases22. Under the China case definition, a severe case is defined as tachypnoea (\u226730 breaths/ min) or oxygen saturation \u226493% at rest, or PaO2/FIO2 <300 mmHg7. Assuming severe cases to require hospitalisation (as opposed to all of the cases that were hospitalised in China, some of which will have been hospitalised to reduce onward transmission), we used the proportion of severe cases by age in these patients to estimate the proportion of cases and infections requiring hospitalisation.",

Subsequently all 3711 passengers on board were tested over the next month.

        ],
        "Statistical Methods": [
            "During a growing epidemic, a higher proportion of the cases will have been infected recently (Figure S1). We accounted for this by re-parameterising a Gamma model to account for exponential growth using a growth rate of 0.14 per day obtained from the early case onset data (see Supplementary Methods). Using Bayesian methods, we fitted a Gamma distributions to data on times from onset-todeath and onset-to-recovery conditional on having observed the final outcome. Missing onset dates were imputed based on dates of report where available.",
            "To estimate the CFR using aggregated data we used our estimates of the distribution of times from onset-to-death to project the expected cumulative number of deaths given the onsets observed in Wuhan and outside Wuhan. We began by assuming that the attack rate is uniform across age-groups (i.e. all ages are equally susceptible). Using the age-distribution of the population, for a given attack rate, we therefore obtained an estimate of the expected infections in each age-group. Underascertainment was then estimated inside and outside Wuhan by comparing observed cases by age to this expected distribution assuming perfect ascertainment in the 50-59 age-group. For Wuhan, we added an additional scaling (fitted using a Binomial likelihood) to account for further underascertainment compared to outside Wuhan (given the over-stretched health system). These steps gave us the expected age-distribution of cases.",
            "For a given onset-to-death distribution, we then obtained a modelled estimate of the cumulative deaths by age under an age-dependent CFR (fitted relative to the CFR in the oldest age-group, which represented the largest number of deaths). This was compared to the observed deaths by age using a Poisson likelihood. These data were then jointly fitted alongside the most-recent age-aggregated cumulative deaths and cases in mainland China, fitted using a binomial likelihood. This follows from the observation that given the current situation, where both observed cases and deaths have dropped substantially following a peak in late January, the ratio of current cumulative cases, once corrected for under-ascertainment, to current death provide a good estimate of the final CFR11.",
            "To estimate the IFR we additionally fitted to data on infection prevalence from international Wuhan residents that were repatriated to their home countries. This is formulated as an additional Binomial likelihood, incorporating a translation from incidence to period prevalence accounting for epidemic growth over this period. Our age-stratified CFR and IFR model was then jointly fitted to the case data and infection prevalence data using Bayesian methods. We used our estimates of the onset-to-death distribution obtained from fitting to the 24 deaths in China as a prior distribution. Full mathematical details are given in the Supplementary Information.",
            "The estimates of the proportion of cases that are severe were obtained from a subset of data. Assuming a uniform attack rate by age-groups as before, we use the demography-adjusted underascertainment rates calculated above to obtain an estimate of the proportion of infections that require hospitalisation.",
            "To independently validate our IFR estimate, we analysed data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise liner taking the dates of reported positive tests as a proxy for onset date (acknowledging that this could be before the onset of symptoms for some passengers and after onset for others given potential delays in testing and reporting). We fitted a logistic growth curve to the cumulative proportion testing positive on each day weighted by inverse variance (Supplementary Information) and calculated the expected proportion of deaths observed up to 5th March given the onset times and estimated onset-to-death distribution.",
            "We used parametric (Supplementary Information) and non-parametric methods11,25 to estimate the CFR in cases reported outside mainland China using individual-level data on dates of onset, date of report and date of outcome (death, recovery or unknown). Cases where the outcome was unknown were treated as censored observations. For 72% of cases, the date of onset was not reported. For the cases with known date of reporting and missing onset date (n=958) we imputed the date of onset from the observed onset-to-report times. Furthermore, 21% of reports of case recoveries mentioned this in aggregate (e.g. x recoveries on day y) and hence could not be linked to a specific case. This was accounted for in the fitting by including an additional parameter to estimate the proportion of recoveries reported. The parametric models were fitted to the data using Bayesian methods (see Supplementary Material). For the non-parametric method we randomly imputed the missing dates of onset and recovery status 100 times.",

        "Results": [
            "Figure 2A shows the subset of 24 deaths from COVID-19 that occurred in mainland China early in the epidemic. During a growing epidemic, we are more likely to observe shorter times from onset-todeath because those that occur later will not yet have been reported. Correcting for this bias, we estimate the mean time from onset-to-death to be 18.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 15.7-49.7 days) with a coefficient of variation, CV, of 0.45 days (95% crI 0.29-0.54 days). With the limited number of observations in these data and given that they were from early in the epidemic, we could not exclude many deaths occurring with longer times from onset-to-death (hence the high upper credible interval). However, given that the epidemic in China has since declined, our posterior estimate of the mean time from onset-to-death informed by the analysis of aggregated China data is more precise (mean 17.8 days, 95% crI 16.9-19.2 days, Figure 2).",
            "We similarly estimated the mean time from onset-to-recovery using data on outcomes in 169 cases reported outside mainland China. We obtain a slightly longer duration for the onset-to-recovery distribution of 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1-24.4 days) and CV of 0.33 days (95% crI 0.30-0.37 days) (Figure 2).",
            "Table 1 shows estimates of the CFR obtained from aggregate data on cases and deaths in mainland China. A large proportion of the cases, including all of those early in the epidemic, were reported from Wuhan where the local health system was quickly overwhelmed. Furthermore, the case definition outside Wuhan required a travel-link to Wuhan. Figure 3A shows a difference in the resulting agedistribution of cases reported from these two areas. Reported cases in Wuhan are more frequent in older age-groups, perhaps reflecting higher severity (and hence prioritisation for hospitalisation in Wuhan) whilst cases outside Wuhan may also represent a bias in terms of the relationship between age and travel. Adjusting for differences in underlying demography and assuming no overall difference in the attack rate by age, we estimate a high level of under-ascertainment of cases in younger agegroups in both Wuhan and outside Wuhan (Figure 3 C-D). Furthermore, we estimate a higher level of under-ascertainment overall in Wuhan compared to outside Wuhan (Figure 3C). Accounting for this under-ascertainment, we estimate the highest CFR in the 80+ age-group of 13.4% (11.2-15.9%) (Figure 3B, Table 1). Our estimates of CFR decline rapidly with decreasing age, with very low rates in young adults and children.",
            "In cases reported outside mainland China, we estimate an overall modal CFR of 2.7% (95% crI 1.4%4.7%) using the parametric model (Table 2). However, this reflects a balance of cases detected in different ways in the surveillance system. In those that reported travel to mainland China (and hence will have been detected in the surveillance system due to this travel link), we estimate an overall modal CFR of 1.2% (95% crI 0.4%-4.0%). In those without any reported travel to China (therefore detected either through contact tracing or through hospital surveillance) we estimate a slightly higher CFR (although with high overlap in posterior distributions) of 3.6% (95% crI 1.9%-7.2%) using the parametric model. We estimate a lower CFR in those aged under 60 years of age (1.3%, 95% credible interval, crI 0.5%-3.5%) compared to those aged 60 years and over (4.1%, 95% crI 1.8%-11.0%) in this population. Similar estimates were obtained using non-parametric methods (Table 2). Comparing those under and over-60 years of age, we find estimates that are consistent with those observed in cases from mainland China (Tables 1 and 2).",
            "We estimated a prevalence of infection in international Wuhan residents repatriated on 6 flights of 0.87% (6/689, 95% CI 0.32%-1.9%). Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we estimate an IFR of 0.66% (95% crI 0.39-1.33%). As for the CFR, this is strongly age-dependent with estimates rising steeply from age 50 upwards (Table 1). The demography- and under-ascertainment adjusted proportion of infections requiring hospitalisation ranges from 1.1% in the 20-29 age-group up to 18.4% in the 80+ age-group (Table 3). Using these age-stratified IFR estimates, we estimate the IFR in the Diamond Princess population to be 2.9%. Given the delay from onset of symptoms to death, we would expect 56% of these deaths to have occurred by 5th March 2020 giving an estimate of the current IFR of 1.6% compared to the empirical estimate of 1.0% (7/706, 95% CI 0.4-2.0%)."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "Based on extensive analysis of data from different regions of the world, our best estimate at the current time for the CFR of COVID-19 in China is 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%-1.53%). Whilst this remains lower than estimates for other coronaviruses including SARS27 and MERS28, it is substantially higher than estimates from the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic29\u201331. Our estimate of an IFR of 0.66% in China was informed by PCR-testing of international Wuhan residents returning on repatriation flights. This is consistent with the IFR observed to date in passengers on the Princess Diamond Cruise ship. Our 8",
            "estimates of the probability of requiring hospitalisation assume that only severe cases clinically require hospitalisation. This is clearly different from the pattern of hospitalisation that occurred in China, where hospitalisation was also used to ensure case isolation. Mortality can also be expected to vary with the underlying health of specific populations, given that the risks associated with COVID-19 will be heavily influenced by the presence of underlying co-morbidities.",
            "Our estimate of the CFR is substantially lower than the crude CFR obtained from China based on the cases and deaths observed to date, which is currently 3.67%, as well as many of the estimates currently in the literature. The principle reason for this is that the crude estimate does not take into account the severity of cases. Various estimates have been made from patient populations ranging from those with generally milder symptoms (for example international travellers detected through screening of travel history13,32) through to those identified in the hospital setting14,15,33. We expect higher CFRs in those that are more severely ill. Many case reports note that the presence of other underlying conditions result in poorer prognosis. Although we were unable to adjust for this effect in the absence of detailed individual-level data, this is likely to be correlated with age. However, it should also be noted that the distribution of underlying conditions will vary geographically, and particularly between high-, middle- and low-income settings.",
            "It is clear from the data that has emerged from China that there is a significant increase in the CFR with age. Our results suggest a very low fatality ratio in those under the age of 20. However, as there are very few cases in this age-group, it remains unclear whether this reflects a low risk of death or a difference in susceptibility. Serological testing in this age-group will therefore be critical in the coming weeks to understand the significance of this age-group in driving population transmission. There is a clear increase in the estimated CFR from the age of 50 upwards, with this proportion rising from approximately 1% in the 50-59 age-group to 13% in those aged 80 and above. This increase in severity with age is clearly reflected in case-reports in which the mean age tends to be in the range 50-60 years. Different surveillance systems will pick up a different age-case-mix and we find that those with milder symptoms detected through history of travel are younger on average than those detected through hospital surveillance. Our correction for this surveillance bias therefore allows us to obtain estimates that can be applied to different case-mixes and demographic population structures. However, it should be noted that this correction is applicable under the assumption of a uniform infection attack rate (i.e. exposure) across the population.",
            "Much of the information informing any global estimate of the CFR at the current time is from the early outbreak in Wuhan, China. Given that the health system in this city was quickly over-whelmed, our estimates suggest that there is substantial under-ascertainment of cases in the younger age-groups (who we estimate to have milder disease) in comparison to elsewhere in mainland China. This underascertainment is the main factor driving the difference between our estimate of the crude CFR from China (3.67%) and our best estimate of the overall CFR (1.4%). Furthermore, the CFR is likely to be strongly influenced by the availability of healthcare. Whilst in Wuhan this was stretched, our estimates from international cases are of a similar magnitude, suggesting relatively little difference in health outcome. Finally, as clinical knowledge of this new disease accrues, it is possible that outcomes will improve. It will therefore be important to revise these estimates as epidemics unfold.",
            "The world is currently experiencing the early stages of a global pandemic. While China has succeeded in containing spread for two months, this is unlikely to be achievable in most countries. Thus, much of the world will experience very large community epidemics of COVID-19 over the coming weeks and months. Our estimates of the underlying IFR of this infection will inform assessments of health impacts likely to be experienced in different countries and thus decisions around appropriate mitigation policies to be adopted.",

            "Data<br/><br/>Individual-level data on early deaths from mainland China<br/><br/>The authors identified information on the characteristics of 48 cases who died from COVID-19 infection in Hubei Province reported by the National Health Commission and the Hubei Province Health Commission website20,21.",
            "A higher proportion of the cases will have been infected recently (Figure S1)",
            "The authors accounted for this by re-parameterising a Gamma model to account for exponential growth using a growth rate of 0.14 per day obtained from the early case onset data.",
            "For Wuhan, the authors added an additional scaling to account for further underascertainment compared to outside Wuhan",
            "These steps gave them the expected age-distribution of cases"
        ],
        "Results": [
            "The authors are more likely to observe shorter times from onset-todeath because those that occur later will not yet have been reported.",
            "Correcting for this bias, the authors estimate the mean time from onset-to-death to be 18.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 15.7-49.7 days) with a coefficient of variation, CV, of 0.45 days (95% crI 0.29-0.54 days).",
            "The authors obtain a slightly longer duration for the onset-to-recovery distribution of 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1-24.4 days) and CV of 0.33 days (95% crI 0.30-0.37 days) (Figure 2)"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Based on extensive analysis of data from different regions of the world, the best estimate at the current time for the CFR of COVID-19 in China is 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%-1.53%).",
            "The authors' estimate of an IFR of 0.66% in China was informed by PCR-testing of international Wuhan residents returning on repatriation flights.",
            "The authors used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR).",
            "Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk"
