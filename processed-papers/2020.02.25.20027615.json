        "abstract": "Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xian. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10th and February 4th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.",

Data analysis reveals that strengthening the public health interventions, tracing imported cases and improving the confirmation rate are effective and timely after January 23rd 2020. According to the traced data shown in Figure 1, the first imported cases in Shaanxi Province were earlier than January 10, and most of the imported cases were imported to Shaanxi Province before the national travel restrictions were implemented on January 23nd, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, the earlier implementation of travel restriction will greatly reduce the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province, which was not serious."

This enhanced model capacity for near-casting is particularly important, since the gradually relaxing of the travel restriction demands proactive- and real-time assessment of the risk of a potential second outbreak in other Chinese cities. An objective of our study is to provide this assessment, and to use this assessment along with the incorporation of feasible public health interventions into our stochastic disease transmission model to suggest the scale of interventions for these cities to prevent a second outbreak.

Since the outbreak scale in the Province of Shanxi was relatively small and this is subject to stochasticity in both case importation and local cases generated by the importation and since the Provincial data has detailed information on symptom onset and serial intervals, we adopt a method developed by Nishiura and Chowell [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] to estimate the effective reproduction number, and we revise some of our early deterministic models to a novel discrete stochastic model to address the key issues relevant to preventing a secondary outbreak of COVID-19 in other provinces except for Hubei, due to the anticipated gradually relaxing of travel restriction and returning to normal social and economic activities."

Figure2(B) shows the correlation between the total imported cases and the number of population flow into the Shaanxi province, from which we calculate the proportion of those inflows that are infected.",

It follows from Figure 4 that most cases are in Xi\u2019an city, few cases are in the northern part of Shaanxi while relatively many cases are in the southern part of Shaanxi, which is adjacent to Hubei province. Therefore, we can estimate the impact of population migration on the epidemic situation in the neighboring areas of Hubei Province.",
            "The detailed records reveal how long the patients stay in latent, infected and hospitalized compartments. Based on all cases reported in Shaanxi province we use the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the median duration from illness onset to first medical visit (quarantined, denoted by T2W) is around 0.60 days, median duration from first medical visit (quarantined) to confirmation (denoted by T3W) is around 3.43 days, shown in Figure 5. In particular, for imported cases, the median duration from importation to illness onset (denoted by T1I) is around 2.38 days with longest incubation duration of 19 days, median duration from illness onset to first medical visit (quarantined, denoted by T2I ) is around 1 days with the longest (or shortest) duration of 15 ( or 0) days; median duration from the first medical visit to confirmation (denoted by T3I) is around 3.05 days with the longest (or shortest) duration of 13 ( or 1 days). For local cases median duration from illness onset to first medical visit (quarantined, denoted by T2L ) is around 0.29 days with the longest (or shortest) infectious duration of 10 ( or 0) days; median duration from the first medical visit to confirmation (denoted by T3L) is around 3.9 days with the longest (or shortest) duration of 16 ( or 1 days). This analysis indicates that local people went to medical visit when having illness onset much quicker than the imported individuals. Further, these durations are relatively smaller than those for mainland China or Hubei province [?], which implies that the control measures implemented in Shaanxi are timely and medical resources are relatively sufficient.",
            "From the detailed record we can find 21 transmission chains (or transmission trees) which involve 60 cases with 13 imported cases. For each transmission chain we obtained when and who infected whom, and calculated the mean control reproduction number of 1.48 with standard deviation (std) 0.98. In particular, it follows from 21 transmission chains that the number of secondary infections for each seeded case yields 2,2,1,5,1, 0,2,2,2,1, 1,1,2,1,2, 1,1,1,1,1, 1. As mentioned before, the early reported cases in Shaanxi are mainly imported cases before February 3rd, 2020. Then, given seed infected individuals who may get infection from January 23rd to February 3rd, 2020, we had the transmission 13 chains (No 1-13 as shown in Figure 6), which gives mean control reproduction number of 1.69 with std 1.18.",
            "To investigate the effect of resumption of work on the epidemic, especially on possible second outbreak, by which we may suggest the public health sectors when workers can return back to Shaanxi, we predicate the disease infection by using the data on imported cases and moving from other cities to Shaanxi province (shown in Figure 2). Suppose population to start to return back to Shannxi province from February 24th to March 9th, 2020, we can see from Figure 9 (A-B) that there is a large second outbreak. If the proportions of imported cases are decreased by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak becomes smaller and smaller, shown in Figure 9(C-D), (E-F), and (G-H), respectively. Further, if the inflow mode is changed into the intermittent inflow, that is, population are allowed to move into Shaanxi every other week, we can from Figure 10 that there are one more outbreaks with low peak values. Decreasing the imported proportions greatly reduces the peak values of the following outbreaks. Comparing Figure 9 and Figure 10 indicates that intermittent inflow mode may induce small outbreaks and a relatively good choice for resumption of work."

            "From the detailed data description, we can obtain the transmission chains over the time, which enable to calculate the control reproduction number under the implementation of stringent control strategies. The mean control reproduction number ranges from 1.48 to 1.69, and the distribution of these chains agrees well with the effective reproduction number. Note that the effective number has been declining, and is less than unity since January 27th 2020.

            "In this study we extend our deterministic model framework [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] to a discrete system incorporating stochastic modeling of imported cases to represent the relatively small number of cases observed in the Shaanxi province, with about half of them being imported cases. It is worth noting that traced data is around 7 days ahead of the reported ones, as illustrated in Figure 1(A). Moreover, detailed data records revealed that the time interval between the first visit to a doctor and confirmation was longer, with a median of around 4 days. Then, the number of reported cases is not suitable to identify the model or estimate the parameters due to delays such as report delay, confirmation delay, etc. Therefore, it is not accurate to associate the number of confirmed cases with the number of cases in hospital, which may seriously overestimate the scale of the epidemic. Therefore, the multiple traced data sets have been employed to identify the proposed discrete stochastic model and estimate the unknown parameters in this work. Consequently, we use the number of individuals in E, I, and H classes form traced data rather than the newly (or cumulative) reported number to parameterize the model.",

Our main results indicate that the proportion of imported cases is a key variable in order to determine whether the second outbreak is likely or not to occur. The greater the proportion of imported cases the larger the second outbreak has. Furthermore, intermittent importation may induce one further outbreak episode but with small peak values.",
            "From our study, we can conclude that it is very important to study the epidemic situation of COVID-19 by using data from contact tracing rather than simply using the number of confirmed cases, especially in the areas where the imported cases are the main source of infection. This can not only provide important data information for the accurate evaluation of the epidemic situation in other areas outside Hubei Province, but also provide important and accurate data supporting the evaluation of the effectiveness and timeliness of public health intervention strategies in different areas.",
            "In the present investigation, we devised a stochastic model that can be used as an important model framework and methodology for the evaluation of imported cases on local epidemic in the Shaanxi province or other similar provinces. From the data analysis, it seems that the stringent public health interventions adopted by the Chinese authorities are effective in controlling the infection. According to data from contact tracing, the first imported cases in the Shaanxi Province occurred earlier than January 10th 2020, and most of the imported cases were imported to the Shaanxi Province before the implementation of the national travel restrictions on January 23rd 2020. Therefore, the earlier the implementation of the travel restrictions, the greater the reduction of infected cases by COVID-19 in the Shaanxi province has. An intermittent population inflow with low proportion of imported cases may significantly mitigate the transmission risk. Thus, if the public health authorities can strictly monitor and reduce the number of imported cases, it would be possible for the Shaanxi province to return back and resume working continuously."

This can not only provide important data information for the accurate evaluation of the epidemic situation in other areas outside Hubei Province, but also provide important and accurate data support for the evaluation of the effectiveness and timeliness of public health intervention strategies in different areas.",
            "We proposed a stochastic model which can provide an important model framework and methodology for the evaluation of imported cases on local epidemic in the Shaanxi province (and can eventually be adapted for other similar provinces of China). Data analysis reveals that strengthening the public health interventions, tracing imported cases and improving the confirmation rate are effective and timely after January 23rd 2020. According to the traced data shown in Figure 1, the first imported cases in Shaanxi Province were earlier than January 10, and most of the imported cases were imported to Shaanxi Province before the national travel restrictions were implemented on January 23nd, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, the earlier implementation of travel restriction will greatly reduce the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province, which was not serious.",
            "The findings suggest that keeping an intermittent population inflow with a low proportion of imported cases may induce a small second outbreak and hence decrease the transmission risk. Thus, if we can strictly monitor and reduce the number of imported cases, it is possible for Shaanxi to resume work continuously, especially intermittently."

This analysis indicates that local people went to medical visit when having illness onset much quicker than the imported individuals. These durations are relatively smaller than those for mainland China or Hubei province [?], which implies that the control measures implemented in Shaanxi are timely and medical resources are relatively sufficient",
