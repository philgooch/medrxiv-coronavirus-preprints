        "abstract": "Background\nThe emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date. Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China.\n\nMethods\nWe used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity.\n\nResults\nWe identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country.\n\nConclusions\nAs SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.",

Given these importations, we estimate a high risk of onward transmission within a number of countries outside mainland China, particularly in those places where cases were not detected, as these undetected cases could not be isolated, and transmission truncated. Given our results of high risk of onward transmission we highlight the importance of wider testing to pick up community transmission as soon as possible after transmission occurs. We also highlight countries that become at increased risk of importation as transmission occurs outside China, and provide results for each country to assess the countries that pose their highest risk of importation."

            "The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date. Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the betweencountry connectivity. Results We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country. Conclusions As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China.

There are also particular issues in an outbreak of a novel pathogen due to difficulties in mobilizing the response and in development of testing capacities, as well as changes over time in the definition of SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms. There are therefore concerns the reported cases in countries outside of China may be an under-report of what is actually occurring. Previous work has estimated significant under reporting of COVID-19 cases in a number of countries such as Indonesia, Cambodia and Thailand.6 A detailed understanding of the geographical distribution of case importation will help to guide resources to places with currently limited capacity to test, and provide support to perform control measures and support for clinical care."

Outside Asia, we estimate United States, Australia, and United Kingdom as having the highest imported case count estimates (Figure 1 and Table S1). In addition, we also identify countries whose reported number of imported cases from Wuhan is less than the 5th percentile of the posterior predictive distribution of our imported case estimates (Table 1), suggesting under-detected cases imported from Wuhan in these countries or territories. In particular, we estimate that Thailand received 97 (95% CI: 66\u2013136) imported cases from Wuhan\u2014the largest among all the countries analyzed but have only reported ~20 cases (Table 1).

In a second scenario, where we assume that 95% of all the imported cases from Wuhan were immediately isolated, the estimated local outbreak risk reduces substantially, with only Thailand having a local outbreak risk estimate greater than 50%. Still, the estimated risk of local transmission sustaining for at least three generations is not negligible (> 20%) in many other countries or territories, including Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, United States, Malaysia, and Singapore (Table 2 for the countries or territories having a local outbreak risk estimate greater than 50% in the main analysis, and Figure 2 & Table S2 for results obtained for all countries or territories outside of mainland China). For countries where we estimate a large number of unreported cases, the local outbreak risk is ranked higher in the first scenario than the second scenario, as the extra estimated cases not being detected means a higher risk of onward transmission compared to countries where we estimate higher detection (Table 2)."

            "Flight data has been used to determine connectivity between countries and therefore risk of onward transmission from China to other countries. Early in the outbreak, Bogoch et al listed the countries at most risk of importations given the number of flights from Wuhan. 7 Their ranking ultimately followed closely the countries that first reported imported cases, albeit with some countries predicted to report that did not. Since then others have used flight and other data to highlight countries at most risk of importation of SARS-CoV-2 from China. 8,9 These papers have then used the infectious disease vulnerability index (IDVI) as an assessment of how at risk a country is to local transmission. 8,9",
            "In countries where importations are occurring, it will be important to quantify the risk of onward transmission occurring and the extent of this transmission. Kucharski et al 10 considered this generally given the number of importations using a probabilistic model, and Wu et al estimated a probability of transmission within cities outside China. 4 However risk estimates of importations to countries outside China have been focused on the risk of importations from mainland China, with the risk being correlated with the connectivity of places in mainland China to other countries.7\u20139 As transmission increasingly occurs in countries outside mainland China it may also become important to consider the risk of importations to and from other countries. Indeed there have already been cases outside of China, only reporting travel history to countries outside of China, such as from Singapore to the UK,11 and from Thailand, Singapore and Japan to South Korea.12 In light of this, there is some urgency to assessing the relative risks of onward transmission between countries outside of China.",
            "Therefore in this paper we estimate 1) the number of imported cases globally from Wuhan (using flight data and the currently reported cases), then using our estimates of the number of imported cases and current estimates of R0 for SARS-CoV-2 we estimate, 2) the probability of an outbreak in countries outside mainland China, and finally given this outbreak risk and the flights between countries outside mainland China, we estimate 3) the risk index for importations occurring from and to countries outside mainland China. There is, of course, large uncertainty in these values and we propagate the uncertainty through the estimates."

We modelled the offspring distribution of each case as a negative binomial distribution, with mean equal to the basic reproduction number estimated by Riou et al 15, and dispersion parameter assumed to be equal to that of SARS-CoV.16 Using the first-step analysis, the local outbreak risk can be mathematically derived, where we created two scenarios for each country: [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] only the reported cases imported from Wuhan were immediately isolated, but the rest of the estimated cases were not (main analysis) and [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] immediate isolation of 95% of the estimated imported cases from Wuhan. Here, we assumed that immediately isolated cases were not able to cause any secondary infection throughout their infectious periods, and hence the local outbreak risk estimation was conservative.

Countries with a local outbreak risk above 0.5 in our main analysis were named as potential donor countries, and subsequently assessed for their relative potential of exporting SARS-CoV-2 to any recipient country or territory outside mainland China, described as follows.",

For Indonesia there have not been any reported COVID-19 cases imported from Wuhan, and yet we estimate at least 19 (95% CI: 10\u201330) imported cases.",

In a second scenario, where we assume that 95% of all the imported cases from Wuhan were immediately isolated, the estimated local outbreak risk reduces substantially, with only Thailand having a local outbreak risk estimate greater than 50%.

In some of these places, testing may be already increasing, but if not, our results would suggest that these places should be targets for increased screening and testing for SARS-CoV-2.",
            "We next probabilistically determine the risk of local transmission within countries outside mainland China. There is of course currently great uncertainty in these estimates, however some of the countries we estimate with the highest probability have indeed reported (limited) local transmission such as Thailand, the US, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and the South Korea 18. This information was not used to generate our estimates, but provides some validation for the model. In countries such as Singapore, intensive contact tracing of cases and testing of all pneumonia cases was implemented19, increasing the likelihood of finding community transmission. The impact of control measures after initial detected cases is not included in our model, but may alter the risk of onward transmission and should be considered in further iterations of the model as in other modelling work considering impact interventions under different transmission scenarios.20,21 Other countries that we estimate to be at high risk of local transmission, but that have not yet detected transmission 18 include Indonesia, Cambodia, Canada and the Philippines. For all these places, our results suggest there could be a consideration of expanding testing of pneumonia or influenza like illness cases beyond those who have currently travelled, to find community transmission as soon as possible after it occurs, as has been ongoing in Singapore19 and has been recommended recently in some areas of the US 22.",
            "We estimate that in the first wave of inter-country spread not including mainland China the countries at highest risk are still mainly within Asia, the Pacific, North America and Europe. The first importations of cases to and from countries outside mainland China have already occurred, including from Singapore to the UK, 23 and Thailand, Japan and Singapore to the South Korea.12 Singapore was second highest on our UK donor risk result list after Hong Kong and Japan, Singapore and Thailand were numbers 4, 5 and 6 on the South Korea\u2019s list after Macao, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Given our results and these observations, it would seem prudent for planning to consider the scenario in which the number of countries that may be both recipient and donors of importations will be increasing. Once transmission is confirmed in a possible donor country, our estimates of the risk transmission index are no longer needed, and the number of reported cases and the volume of traffic between countries are what will become important (see Table S3). However it must be considered that transmission may not always be detected quickly in all possible donor countries so estimates of the risk of transmission in donor countries may remain useful for planning. Though many of the countries at risk of second wave importations are similar to those at risk from Wuhan, there are some countries that we did not estimate as having the highest numbers of importations from",
            "Wuhan, but become at increased risk as we consider donor countries outside mainland China. These include India, New Zealand, Spain and Mexico, as they have greater links to countries outside mainland China than to Wuhan, China. With the first imported case in Africa recently reported in Egypt 24 (which was estimated to have the highest link with mainland China by Lai et al.8,) we must assess where we are in the timeline of the outbreak with respect to importations to Africa, and including the risk of importation from not only mainland China could be important here.",
            "Not included in our analysis currently is the risk of importation from places in China outside Wuhan. There have yet not been enough importations from outside Wuhan to use our current method, and there is currently much uncertainty on the numbers of cases in China to use this data. However as this changes, methods using both types of data could be considered here. The links between other places in China may follow similar patterns to Wuhan and therefore our risk of countries vulnerable for outbreaks and sourcing onward transmission may be similar, but there may be places that are differentially connected to Wuhan and other places in China and so will become at increased risk as importations from China continue. In addition, flights from other places in China to different countries will be truncated at different times for different countries depending on if and when countries halted incoming flights from China. We also currently don\u2019t consider travel across land or sea borders in our analysis.",
            "There are other limitations to our analysis. We assume that R0 in places outside of Wuhan is similar to that estimated from early transmission in Wuhan, however we do not know how variation in climate, population structure, contact patterns, control measures such as contact tracing and quarantine, and other factors may impact transmission. This is an important area for future research based on what is observed in different places and the extension of the analysis to explicitly model transmission in each recipient country can be undertaken as more becomes known.",
            "In summary, we estimate a number of imported cases from Wuhan that were undetected. Given these importations, we estimate a high risk of onward transmission within a number of countries outside mainland China, particularly in those places where cases were not detected, as these undetected cases could not be isolated, and transmission truncated. Given our results of high risk of onward transmission we highlight the importance of wider testing to pick up community transmission as soon as possible after transmission occurs. We also highlight countries that become at increased risk of importation as transmission occurs outside China, and provide results for each country to assess the countries that pose their highest risk of importation."
