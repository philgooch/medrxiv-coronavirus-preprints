While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear.  Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission.  As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission.  However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.",

            "In conclusion, based solely on the observed number of cases so far, the current case count for 2019 nCoV in the United States currently supports subcritical transmission because the upper limit of Ris less than one. This result holds even when a high degree of heterogeneity is permitted (e.g. a dispersion of 0.3). However, it is too early to make a definitive statement about subcriticality because there may still be cases that are pre-symptomatic. This simple approach for assessing whether subcritical transmission is plausible may be applicable to other diseases, such as avian influenza, with low case counts."
