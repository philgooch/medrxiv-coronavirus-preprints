        "abstract": "Profiling the genetic evolution and dynamic spreading of viruses is a crucial task when responding to epidemic outbreaks. We aim to devise novel ways to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak. Our approach relies on the application of Transcendental Information Cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus. We assess information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures that characterise the resulting complex network and suggest touching points and temporal pathways that are of interest for deeper investigation by geneticists and epidemiologists.",

            "In summary, the approach presented in this paper is exploratory and hypotheses generating in nature. It does not confirm or reject any of the hypotheses we generated about the potential transmission and evolution pathways nor does it provide causal explanation for the patterns found. However, the purpose of our work is to provide an alternative view to the epidemic dynamics of the 2019-nCoV outbreak (and potential other outbreaks in the future) that is hidden to state-of-the-art methods, and that may trigger geneticists and epidemiologists to look at pathways in epidemic outbreaks they would not normally be aware of."

            "Profiling the genetic evolution and dynamic spreading of viruses is a crucial task when responding to epidemic outbreaks. We aim to devise novel ways to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak. Our approach relies on the application of Transcendental Information Cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences, and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus. We assess information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures that characterise the resulting complex network and identify touching points and temporal pathways that are candidates for deeper investigation by geneticists and epidemiologists.",

            "We obtained a total of 87 genomic sequences from human subjects that were available via the GISAID EpiFlu DatabaseTM 1 as of Monday, February 10th 2020.",

This structure is the standard input format for the genes-CODON-samplesequence tokeniser featured in the Transcendental Information Cascades R toolchain that is available as free and open scientific software2.",
            "Transcendental Information Cascades (TICs) are a method that first transforms any kind of sequential data into a network of recurring information tokens, to then exploit this network as a kind of analytical middle ground between views to the source data that would otherwise only be accessible individually through distinct analytical frameworks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. The approach falls into the category of contemporary approaches that make use of network theory for the study of dynamical complex systems [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. In the field of phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis our approach can be compared to haplotype networks for example [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] but with the benefit that the resulting network preserves access to temporal patterns at both macroscopic (e.g. whole generation time periods) and microscopic (e.g. short time period bursts) resolution.",
            "At an abstract level a Transcendental Information Cascade is constructed from some sequentially ordered source data in the following way: At first the data from each distinct sequence step is processed to extract unique information tokens. These tokens form the identifier set for that particular sequence step. Then a directed network is generated with one vertex for each sequence step and edges between any two vertices that have a particular token from their identifier set in common and that does not occur in any identifier set of vertices that represent sequence steps between",
            "1https://www.gisaid.org/ 2https://github.com/vuw-c2lab/transcendental-information-cascades these two. In other words, identifier sets represent information token co-occurrences and edges represent information token recurrences.",
            "As the information tokens of interest in this study we encode unique codon identifiers as (a) their position when sliding a window of size 3 in steps of size 3 over the nucleotide sequence (e.g. \u201dpos1\u201d, \u201dpos2\u201d, ...), (b) a flag that indicates the reading frame (\u201d+1\u201d, \u201d+2\u201d or \u201d+3\u201d) that captures the respective triplet in the current window, and (c) the actual matched nucleotide triplet that constitutes the matched codon. The use of this tokenisation is motivated by previous work on phylogenetic profiling and gene sequencing [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] that suggested that codons suit well for assessing similarities (and dissimilarities) at the gene, chromosome, or genome levels [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>].",
            "An example of the particular encoding we use is visualised in Figure 1. It is this tokenisation of the original nucleotide sequences that we use in the TIC approach to construct the information token recurrence network from. This means in our TIC instantiation the nodes represent distinct nucleotide sequences of the virus obtained from patient samples ordered by the date of their collection by researchers (random order in case of same date collections). The edges are unique codon identifier recurrences matched between different nucleotide sequences.",
            "The TIC network we derive in the way described before can be analysed in a variety of ways. Information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures have been introduced as the base framework to start the analysis from [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. In particular we perform (1) an analysis of the information token entropy and evenness over time, (2) an analysis of network clusters of sequences that can be detected in the TIC network, and (3) an analysis of the intra-cluster and inter-cluster nucleotide similarity of the original sequences.",
            "Information token entropy and evenness We perform an analysis of information token entropy and information token evenness in order to understand whether the virus evolution can be considered an open or a closed system. Therefore we assess both measures in an accumulated fashion for each progression step through the ordered nucleotide sequences. In a closed system the information token entropy should strive towards an equilibrium of maximum entropy and not feature any wave-like up and down patterns. If we observe wave-like patterns it means nucleotide sequences at later progression stages feature codon identifiers that have not been observed in earlier nucleotide sequences.",
            "So to measure information token entropy we assess which unique codon identifiers were seen up to a progression step and how often these were seen. This allows to compute the probability for every codon identifier, which then can be used to determine the information token entropy up to that point following the definition of Shannon entropy given as follows: R",
            "Analog to this we can then assess the information token evenness as per Pielou\u2019s species evenness index, which is defined as",
            "Hmax where H is the measured Shannon entropy, and Hmax is the maximum entropy that would be measured if all tokens would be equally likely to occur.",
            "Network analysis The Transcendental Information Cascade network we constructed can be mathematically and visually analysed in order to find structures that are of particular significance for a single epidemic outbreak or to compare different outbreaks structurally. In this study we focus on the former due to the lack of comparative data about other epidemic outbreaks.",
            "We first perform a cluster analysis using the random walk apporach by Blondel et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] on the weighted network that we can construct from our original TIC network by collapsing all edges between the same vertices to unique edges weighted by the sum of the collapsed edges (see Figure 2 for a schematic example and Figure 4 for the actual networks we construct following this approach). Afterwards, we analyse visually the network using the open source software Gephi. In Gephi we scale vertices by their degree and edges by their weight. Furthermore, we colour vertices by their cluster membership. We then run the Yifan Hu [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] layout algorithm (optimal distance: 10,000; relative strength: 0.2; initial step size: 20; step ratio: 0.95; quadtree max level: 50; theta: 0.8; convergence threshold: 1 \u2217 10\u22124; adaptive cooling: enabled) to visualise the network. We repeat the exact same process to construct and visualise three further networks (cf. Figures 5-7) that are representative of the TIC when exclusively focusing on the codon identifiers of each of the reading frames individually.",
            "Cluster evaluation In order to evaluate the meaningfulness of the TIC network against some baseline, we computer the intra-cluster and inter-cluster similarity of the raw nucleotide sequences. This is done by computing all pairwise comparisons of sequences within individual clusters (intra-cluster similarity) and comparison between all sequences from a cluster with all sequences that are not within that cluster (inter-cluster similarity) using the compareStrings function provided by the Biostrings R package [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. The similarity of two sequences is then simply defined as follows: number of dif f erent nucleotides sim(a, b) = 1 \u2212",

However, with an average degree of 8.671 we find that there is certainly structure that differs from just simple step-by-step forward paths that lead to the consecutively next node. This latter result suggests that some codon paths branch and merge, emphasising that there is an evolving variation in the studied genomic sequences.",

In particular we find that in the +1 and +2 reading frame networks the clusters 1, 4, 6 and 7 are quite similar at the nucleotide level compared to all other clusters that are pairwise distinct. For the entire TIC network and the +3 reading frame network instead we find that clusters 1, 3, 5 and 7 show this kind of similarity. Altogether, these results indicate that (a) in some instances the clustering based on structural characteristics of the TIC network overrides actual genomic similarity, and (b) the choice of the reading frames during TIC construction has an impact on the resulting network that needs to be further investigated."

        "Conclusion": [
            "In this paper we presented a novel way to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of an epidemic outbreak. We applied Transcendental Information Cascades to capture the recurrence and co-occurrence of unique codon identifiers over distinct and temporally ordered nucleotide sequences derived from genetic samples taken from different human subjects. Our case study was focused on the recent outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus. We find clusters and evolution pathways of virus genomes in the constructed Transcendental Information Cascade that are candidates to be investigated further for potential human-to-human transmission paths and genetic evolution of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus.",
            "Our study was performed as a snapshot case study on a limited sample of virus data. While this was at the time of this study all data that was available, we will need to re-execute this analysis continuously as more data becomes available to check whether any of our results change. Furthermore, our results indicate that experiments with (a)",
            "alternative tokenisations are needed, such as weighting the +1, +2 and +3 reading frames differently (or omitting certain frames entirely) depending on their functional role [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. We also suggest that it will be important to perform a wider variety of analysis of the generated TIC data (e.g. testing of different network clustering methods, application of dynamical systems analyses techniques) to get more profound insights. Our analysis also does not take measurement biases into account that may results from different techniques used by different laboratories for genome extraction and analysis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
            "In summary, the approach presented in this paper is exploratory and hypotheses generating in nature. It does not confirm or reject any of the hypotheses we generated about the potential transmission and evolution pathways nor does it provide causal explanation for the patterns found. However, the purpose of our work is to provide an alternative view to the epidemic dynamics of the 2019-nCoV outbreak (and potential other outbreaks in the future) that is hidden to state-of-the-art methods, and that may trigger geneticists and epidemiologists to look at pathways in epidemic outbreaks they would not normally be aware of."

            "It is important to note that the evenness of the distribution of codon identifiers is relatively high, converging around a value of 0.95",
            "This means that those codon identifiers that have been observed are quite evenly distributed.",
            "These results allow the interpretation that (a) there is evolving variation in the genomic sequences the authors studied, but (b) there is no indication for the dominance of a particular variance"

        "Conclusion": [
            "In this paper the authors presented a novel way to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of an epidemic outbreak.",
            "The authors find clusters and evolution pathways of virus genomes in the constructed Transcendental Information Cascade that are candidates to be investigated further for potential human-to-human transmission paths and genetic evolution of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus.",
            "The authors' study was performed as a snapshot case study on a limited sample of virus data",
            "While this was at the time of this study all data that was available, the authors will need to re-execute this analysis continuously as more data becomes available to check whether any of the results change."
