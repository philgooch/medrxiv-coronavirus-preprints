        "abstract": "Background and Objective:\nTo predict the epidemic of COVID-19 based on quarantined surveillance from real world in China by modified SEIR model different from the previous simply mathematical model.\nDesign and Methods:\nWe forecasted the epidemic of COVID-19 based on current clinical and epidemiological data and built a modified SEIR model to consider both the infectivity during incubation period and the influence on the epidemic from strict quarantined measures.\nResults:\nThe peak time of the curve for the infected newly diagnosed as COVID-19 should substantially present on Feb.5,2020(in non-Hubei areas) and Feb.19,2020(in Hubei. It is estimated that the peak of the curve of the cumulative confirmed cases will appear in non-Hubei areas on Mar.3,2020 and in Hubei province on Mar.10,2020,and the total number of the patients diagnosed as COVID-19 is 18,000 in non-Hubei areas and 78,000-96,000 in Hubei.The Chinese COVID-19 epidemic can be completely controlled in May,2020.\nConclusions:\nCOVID-19 is only a local outbreak in Hubei Province,China.It can be probably avoided the pandemic of global SARS-CoV-2 cases rise with the great efforts by Chinese government and its people.",

        "Discussion and Conclusions": [
            "From the above,it could be seen that our study was principally based on the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 in recent 45 days and modified SEIR model,which was quite different from other absolutely theoretical models,mainly as follows:1) our study was based on the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 according to epidemic situation,considering that the incubation period was still infectious;2)evaluating R0 was on the basis of the big data of epidemic situation,R0 was 4.9-9.9(the median R0 7.5)in Hubei,but 2.5-4.8(the median R0 3.7) in non-Hubei areas;3)the occasion and intensity of the blocked and isolated measures by Chinese government were unprecedented and efficient in scale,which prevented SARS-CoV-2 outbreaking in non-Hubei area;4)in scale,the COVID-19 epidemic was currently a local public health emergency in Hubei Province in China;5)our insufficiency: whether there was a significant difference in infectivity between the latent and the infected and it required to be further confirmed in clinical practice; the blocked and isolated measures had been implemented differently in different areas due to different economic,cultural and management levels; the maintaining time of the blocked and isolated measures is still in suspense; whether the epidemic will relapse owing to the surveillance paralysis and the complicated population migration caused by returning to work in a large number of enterprises; for SEIR model by itself,the limitations on considering little on other vital factors,such as the improvement of prevention,treatment experience and control measures,the advent of new medication,building new hospitals to shorten waiting time in hospital,are not considered,in addition,the setting of each coefficient is still subjective based on clinical practice.",
            "Substantially,COVID-19 is only a local outbreak in Hubei Province,China.It can be probably avoided the pandemic of global SARS-CoV-2 cases rise with the great efforts by Chinese government and its people."

            "<strong>Background and Objective</strong><br/><br/>The first case of pneumonia of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan,Hubei Province in China on Dec.8,2019,and the epidemic spread rapidly in Wuhan,Hubei Province and the surrounding areas of Hubei Province.1,2A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent by the Chinese authorities on Jan. 7,2020,and on Jan. 10,2020,the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the novel coronavirus as 2019-nCoV,and later defined the pneumonia as COVID-19 associated with infecting SARS-CoV-2.<br/><br/>According to the statistics of National Health Commission of People\u2019s Republic of<br/><br/>China,by at 12:00 on Feb.17, 2020,a total of 441 individuals,including 137 individuals in Singapore and Japan together,were diagnosed as COVID-19 outside of China,and a total of 70,639 infected cases in mainland China,including 58,182 infected cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 associated with SARS-CoV-2 in Hubei Province,accounting for 82.4% of the total count of the infected individuals in China(Figure 1),and including 41,152 cases in Wuhan,accounting for 70.7% of the total number of the infected individuals in Hubei Province.There were 9 cities in Hubei Province,such as Xiaogan, Huanggang,Jingzhou,Suizhou,Xiangyang,Ezhou, Huangshi,Jingmen and Yichang,with more than 1,000 infected patients respectively.And outside of Hubei Province,there were 6 provinces,including Guangdong, Henan,Zhejiang,Hunan,Anhui and Jiangxi,with more than 900 infected patients respectively.The total infected patients in these six provinces accounted for 53.4% of the total infected individuals outside of Hubei Province, in Wenzhou and Shenzhen,the mere two cities, with a total of more than 400 infected persons outside of Hubei Province.<br/><br/>After Wuhan were sealed off on Jan. 23,2020,the other cities in Hubei Province successively started to isolate residential quarters and villages and shut off the traffic to halt the population flow in urban and rural regions.According to Tencent's big dataand Location Intelligence,from Jan.1,2020 to Jan. 24,2020,the population outflow from Wuhan is about 5 million,with 65% of the outflow into other cities in Hubei Province,such as<br/><br/>Huanggang and Xiaogan,and with 55% of the outflow outside of Hubei Province,including Henan, Guangdong,Zhejiang,Hunan,Jiangxi and Anhui together.The remainder population was 9 million in Wuhan,which was the most severe epidemic region.The strict blocked and isolated measures had been taken in other cities in Hubei before the local outbreak of SARS-CoV-2,which had not caused fulminating infection similar to Wuhan.In Hubei and other areas with serious epidemic situation,Chinese government had taken the strict blocked and isolated control,including the infected,the suspiciously infected individuals and the susceptible intimately contacted with the infected and the suspiciously infected individuals,involved the independent community buildings and villages,which were separated and quarantined in a unified way.On Jan.28,2020,JAMA magazine interviewed Professor NIH of the United States,and affirmed that the Chinese government adopted the strategy of closure and quarantine against the epidemic.<br/><br/>Many academics tried to estimate key epidemiological characteristics and possible outcomes of the epidemic by means of transmission model mathematically.On Jan.24,2020,Jonathan M.",
