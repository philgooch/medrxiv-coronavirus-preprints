        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unusually high snowfall in western Washington State in February 2019 led to widespread school and workplace closures. We assessed the impact of social distancing caused by this extreme weather event on the transmission of respiratory viruses.\n\nMETHODS: Residual specimens from patients evaluated for acute respiratory illness at hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses. Transmission models were fit to each virus, with disruption of contact rates and care-seeking informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital admissions. \n\nRESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16% to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3% to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in early epidemic phase.\n\nCONCLUSION: High-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak.",

            "Nucleic acids extracted from respiratory swab specimens from study participants were screened for the presence of multiple respiratory pathogens by reverse-transcription and Taqman. Screened pathogens included influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B; human coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1) (hCoV); human metapneumovirus (hMPV); rhinovirus (HRV), and adenovirus (AdV).",
            "Unusually heavy snowfall occurred in the greater Seattle metropolitan area between Feb 3 and Feb 11 2019, totalling 20.2 inches at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport over this time (Figure 1). The majority of public schools in the region were closed for at least five days, with a weekend in between. Traffic volumes on major interstate highways in the greater Seattle area ranged between 24% and 90% (mean, 63%) of average daily volume during the 12 day period from Feb 3 to Feb 15, 2019.\u200b10 Admissions to Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington Medical Center, and Northwest Hospital ranged from 72% to 99% (mean, 90%) of average daily volume over this same period. City of Seattle public preschools were closed from Feb 9 through Feb 13, and King County public transportation was on emergency service from Feb 9 through Feb 12.",
            "We modeled daily counts of Seattle Flu Study specimens testing positive for each of nine respiratory viruses using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) framework, allowing for decreases both in virus transmission and in probability of detection by surveillance during the period of school and traffic disruption (Figure 2). The transient weather-related decrease in effective contact rates ranged from 16.2% (95% CI, 7.1\u201324.2%) for coronavirus to 94.6% (95% CI, 70.7\u2013100%) for RSV A (Table 1).",
            "We estimated the percent of infections averted by weather-related city-wide disruption by simulating transmission of each of these nine viruses with and without the presence of decreased effective contact rates and compared incidence of infection under both scenarios. The percent of infections averted ranged from 3.0% (95% CI, 2.0\u20133.7%) for human metapneumovirus to 9.2% (95% CI, 6.2\u201310.3%) for RSV B (Table 1). Comparing the pathogens with the highest incidence, influenza A/H1N1 and influenza A/H3N2, we observed that the weather-related disruption occurred shortly before the predicted peak of the influenza A/H1N1 epidemic but early in the course of the influenza A/H3N2 epidemic (Figure 3). The estimated impact of the disruption was significantly greater for A/H1N1 (7.6% of infections averted, 95% CI, 5.2\u20138.7%) than for A/H3N2 (3.1% averted, 95% CI, 2.5\u20133.2%). For A/H1N1, the weather-related transmission disruption appears to have reduced incidence without significant rebound, while the main effect on A/H3N2 was to delay the peak in incidence by an estimated 18 days (95% CI, 17\u201321 days).",
            "To characterize the effect of the timing of social distancing on epidemic incidence, we simulated the incidence of influenza A/H3N2 without any weather-related disruption, and with a 14-day disruption starting between day 20 and day 80 of the epidemic (Figure 4). In the absence of any disruption, the epidemic is predicted to peak on day 67. Early in the course of the epidemic, a 14-day disruption, by itself, has little effect on the final epidemic size. In contrast, disruptions at or near the peak can meaningfully reduce peak incidence. For example, a disruption starting on day 65 reduced total incidence by 16% in these simulations.",
            "Modeling and simulation studies have been used to predict the impact of social distancing on the course of a hypothetical influenza pandemic (e.g. \u200b11\u201314). Although there is heterogeneity in the specific form of social distancing modeled, most of the studies have assumed that social distancing measures are initiated early in the course of a pandemic. These studies consistently suggest that such social distancing can delay the timing and intensity of the pandemic peak, but with little impact on the final attack rate of the pandemic. Our observations support these findings. The extreme snowfall of February 2019 occurred early in the seasonal epidemics of influenza A/H3N2 and hMPV, and we estimate that the final attack rates of these viruses only decreased by 3% and the peaks only shifted by 18 or 15 days, respectively. In contrast, the extreme snowfall occurred close to the predicted peak of the seasonal epidemics of several other viruses, particularly influenza A/H1N1 and RSV. For these viruses, weather-related social distancing had larger impacts, with final attack rates reduced by 7.6% to 9.2% and prevalence remaining below the pre-disruption level for the remainder of the season. This finding suggests that short-term social distancing is most effective at reducing overall attack rates when it occurs close to the peak of the epidemic, or equivalently when force of infection is greatest.",
            "Because it is unlikely that traffic and school closure data fully capture the changes in population contacts due to extreme snowfall, we did not attempt to parse the relative impacts of specific changes on routes of transmission. However, we did observe that decreases in effective contact rates were negatively correlated with the fraction of subjects 18 years of age or older for each pathogen (R\u200b2\u200b = \u20130.65, p=0.06). As reductions in effective contact rates were greatest for viruses impacting the youngest, this suggests that weather-related school closures may have had a greater effect on contact frequencies among children than commuting and workplace disruptions among adults.",
            "Simulation studies to estimate the impact of social distancing on an influenza pandemic\u200b11\u201314\u200b have generally assumed that social distancing is implemented early in the pandemic and maintained until the end of the pandemic, a period of many months. The feasibility of such long-term interventions is unclear. In contrast, the widespread school and travel disruptions resulting from snowfall in Feb 2019 serve as a proxy for a more realistic high-intensity, short-duration social distancing intervention, where schools and workplaces are closed and re-congregation is discouraged for approximately two weeks. Our study suggests that such an intervention could be beneficial in reducing the total incidence if implemented near the peak of a pandemic."
