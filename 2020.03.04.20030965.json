Eighteen Literatures were identified with cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. The extracted data includes clinical symptoms, age, gender, sample size and region et al were systematic reviewed and meta analyzed.\nResults: 14 eligible studies including 1,424 patients were analyzed. Symptoms like fever (89.2%), cough (67.2%), fatigue (43.6%) were common, dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominal pain and conjunctival congestion/conjunctivitis were rare. Polypnea/dyspnea in severe patients were significantly higher than non-severe (42.7% vs.16.3%, P&lt;0.0001). Fever and diarrhea were higher in severe patients(p=0.0374and0.0267). Further meta-analysis showed incidence of fever(OR1.70,95%CI 1.01-2.87), polypnea/dyspnea(OR3.53, 95%CI 1.95-6.38) and diarrhea(OR1.80,95%CI 1.06-3.03) was higher in severe patients, which meant the severe risk of patients with fever, polypnea/dyspnea, diarrhea were 1.70, 3.53, 1.80 times higher than those with no corresponding symptoms. \nConclusions: Fever, cough and fatigue are common symptoms in COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with non-severe patients, the symptoms as fever, polypnea/dyspnea and diarrhea are potential symptoms lead to severity.",

            "In December 2019, a series of unknown caused pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, it's clinical manifestations were very similar to viral pneumonia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Later novel coronavirus was found as source virus, and named COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. At present, novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) had been rapidly spread throughout China and overseas countries [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Human-to-human transmission of this virus was proved [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. The clinical features of NCP patients were diversified, in severe cases it may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even death[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Currently, no systematic review and Meta-analysis of the clinical characteristics of NCP was found. This paper reviewed and compared the difference between severe and non-severe of the disease, which would help to better understand and guide future."

            "Sources and search criteria<br/><br/>We conducted a comprehensive systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane database, and google to find all published studies that describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, using the search terms, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d. According to title and abstract, two independent researchers selected and classified literatures, and reviewed all followed criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criterina Literatures described NCP patient's clinical signs. If there were duplicates in the study population, the literature with the largest sample size will be included. Cases that did not describe the clinical characteristics of NCP patients and repeated cases were excluded. Articles published by the same author were carefully screened to identify duplication. Data extraction and analysis All available publications have been carefully analyzed and strictly reviewed. The collected clinical data include population data (age, gender), number of patients and clinical manifestations. Full-text versions of relevant articles were reviewed, quality of the selected articles were evaluated, and clinical characteristics were extracted. We compared the clinical characteristics of severe and non-severe patients originally from three articles classified NCP patients as severe and non-severe. Statistical analysis SAS 9.4 and Review Manager 5.3 software were used for analysis and drawing. Continuous variables were represented by median and quartile ranges (IQR). Classification variables were summarized as counts and percentages in each category. The age, gender, number and clinical signs of NCP patients were statistically described; Cochran-mantel-Haenszel test (stratified chi-square test) was used to compare the differences between severe and non-severe NCP. With OR (Odds ratio) as the effect quantity, we used Mantel-Haenszel test with fixed or random effect for further meta-analysis of the clinical signs with statistical differences, and showed by drawing forest map. Symmetry tested by funnel plot."

            "Search result A total of 333 relevant literatures published in PubMed and other databases were detected, 68 were removed because of duplication. 265 were removed based on the inclusion criteria. 23 literaturesdid not report clinical signs. 4 were excluded because of casesoverlapped[8-9.12-13]. Finally, 14 articles were included for the final analysis[10-11.14-25]. Fig 1 shows the study selection flowchart. Data from all eligible studies were obtained frompublished manuscripts. Synthesis of results A systematic review showed that 610 patients (42.8%) with NCP were female. Fever (89.2%) and cough (67.2%) were the most common symptoms, followed by fatigue (43.6%), phlegm (28.6%), shortness of breath/difficulty(21.7%), and the less common symptoms were dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominalpain, conjunctivalcongestion/conjunctivitis.1,377 cases were divided into severe group (1,110) and non-severe group (267), Stratified chi-square test showed that there was nosignificant difference in gender between the two groups(P>0.05), and the median age of severe patients was slightly older. Polypnea/dyspnea in severe patients were significantly higher than in non-severe patients (42.7% vs.16.3%, P<0.0001), fever and diarrhea were higher in severe patients (P=0.0374and0.0267).

In the early stages of NCP nonspecific signs and symptoms may be clinically indistinguishable from other common infectious diseases, especially winter respiratory virus. These characteristics of NCP had some similarities with SARS-CoVand MERS-CoVinfections[27.28]. However, patients with COVID-19 rarely had obvious signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract (nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, runny nose, sore throat). In addition, intestinal signs and symptoms such as diarrhea were rare in NCP patients, while about 20-25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhea. It should be noted that fever of NCP(10.8%) patients was more common than SARS-CoV (1%) and MERS-CoV(2%)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Our systematic review had limitations.

            "Objective: To compare the difference between severe and non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia and figure out the potential symptoms lead to severity. Methods: Articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane database, and google up-to 24 February 2020 were systematically reviewed. Eighteen Literatures were identified with cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. The extracted data includes clinical symptoms, age, gender, sample size and region et al were systematic reviewed and meta analyzed. Results: 14 eligible studies including 1,424 patients were analyzed. Symptoms like fever (89.2%), cough (67.2%), fatigue (43.6%) were common, dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominal pain and conjunctival congestion/conjunctivitis were rare. Polypnea/dyspnea in severe patients were significantly higher than non-severe (42.7% vs.16.3%, P<0.0001). Fever and diarrhea were higher in severe patients(p=0.0374and0.0267). Further meta-analysis showed incidence of fever(OR1.70,95%CI 1.01-2.87), polypnea/dyspnea(OR3.53, 95%CI 1.95-6.38) and diarrhea(OR1.80,95%CI 1.06-3.03) was higher in severe patients, which meant the severe risk of patients with fever, polypnea/dyspnea, diarrhea were 1.70, 3.53, 1.80 times higher than those with no corresponding symptoms. Conclusions: Fever, cough and fatigue are common symptoms in COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with non-severe patients, the symptoms as fever, polypnea/dyspnea and diarrhea are potential symptoms lead to severity."

        "Introduction": [
            "In December 2019, a series of unknown caused pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, it's clinical manifestations were very similar to viral pneumonia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Later novel coronavirus was found as source virus, and named COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. At present, novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) had been rapidly spread throughout China and overseas countries [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Human-to-human transmission of this virus was proved [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. The clinical features of NCP patients were diversified, in severe cases it may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even death[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Currently, no systematic review and Meta-analysis of the clinical characteristics of NCP was found. This paper reviewed and compared the difference between severe and non-severe of the disease, which would help to better understand and guide future."

        "Method": [
            "We conducted a comprehensive systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane database, and google to find all published studies that describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, using the search terms, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d. According to title and abstract, two independent researchers selected and classified literatures, and reviewed all followed criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criterina Literatures described NCP patient's clinical signs. If there were duplicates in the study population, the literature with the largest sample size will be included. Cases that did not describe the clinical characteristics of NCP patients and repeated cases were excluded. Articles published by the same author were carefully screened to identify duplication. Data extraction and analysis All available publications have been carefully analyzed and strictly reviewed. The collected clinical data include population data (age, gender), number of patients and clinical manifestations. Full-text versions of relevant articles were reviewed, quality of the selected articles were evaluated, and clinical characteristics were extracted. We compared the clinical characteristics of severe and non-severe patients originally from three articles classified NCP patients as severe and non-severe. Statistical analysis SAS 9.4 and Review Manager 5.3 software were used for analysis and drawing. Continuous variables were represented by median and quartile ranges (IQR). Classification variables were summarized as counts and percentages in each category. The age, gender, number and clinical signs of NCP patients were statistically described; Cochran-mantel-Haenszel test (stratified chi-square test) was used to compare the differences between severe and non-severe NCP. With OR (Odds ratio) as the effect quantity, we used Mantel-Haenszel test with fixed or random effect for further meta-analysis of the clinical signs with statistical differences, and showed by drawing forest map. Symmetry tested by funnel plot."

            "Search result A total of 333 relevant literatures published in PubMed and other databases were detected, 68 were removed because of duplication. 265 were removed based on the inclusion criteria. 23 literaturesdid not report clinical signs. 4 were excluded because of casesoverlapped[8-9.12-13]. Finally, 14 articles were included for the final analysis[10-11.14-25]. Fig 1 shows the study selection flowchart. Data from all eligible studies were obtained frompublished manuscripts. Synthesis of results A systematic review showed that 610 patients (42.8%) with NCP were female. Fever (89.2%) and cough (67.2%) were the most common symptoms, followed by fatigue (43.6%), phlegm (28.6%), shortness of breath/difficulty(21.7%), and the less common symptoms were dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominalpain, conjunctivalcongestion/conjunctivitis.1,377 cases were divided into severe group (1,110) and non-severe group (267), Stratified chi-square test showed that there was nosignificant difference in gender between the two groups(P>0.05), and the median age of severe patients was slightly older. Polypnea/dyspnea in severe patients were significantly higher than in non-severe patients (42.7% vs.16.3%, P<0.0001), fever and diarrhea were higher in severe patients (P=0.0374and0.0267). Conjunctival congestion/conjunctivitis (P=0.0176), hemoptysis (P=0.0344), anorexia (P=0.0008), dizziness (P=0.0023) and abdominal pain (P=0.0015) may highly occurred in severe patients, but the dates of these symptoms only been reported in one or two literatures, so inter-group comparisons of these symptoms should be treated with caution. (See fig 2 and 3) Meta analysis results 3 literatures including 262 cases in the severe group (245 fever,93.51%) and 1,095 cases in the non-severe group (967 fever,88.31%) were used to meta analysis for fever; Three studies were considered to be homogeneous, and fixed effect model(Chi2=0.88, P=0.64, I2=0%).
