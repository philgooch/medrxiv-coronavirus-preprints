            "In summary, in this study, we have identified three indicators (LDH, hs-CRP, and lymphocytes) and even found the early warning thresholds (LDH: 365U/l, hs-CRP: 41.2mg/L, and lymphocytes%: 14.7%) for COVID-19 prognostic prediction and developed an XGBoost machine learning-based prognostic model that can precisely predict the survival rates of severe patients with more than 90% accuracy, enabling the early detection, the early intervention and the reduction of mortality in high-risk patients with COVID-19. From technical point of view, this work helps pave the way for using machine learning method in COVID-19 prediction and diagnosis in the triage of the large scale explosive epidemic COVID-19 cases. Further studies are needed to consider more clinical confounding factors and to increase the sample size for further refining our model."

            "Precision 1.00 0.89    Recall 0.83 1.00<br/><br/>Coronavirus is prevalent in China and all over the world, with high morbidity and high mortality in critically ill patients. According to the recent reports [26], old patients are more prone to be infected by COVID-19, especially for those with underlying diseases. The severity of patients is applying great pressure on the shortage of intensive care resources. Unfortunately, so far, specific clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia in different critical stages remain still unclear. Under this circumstance, novel approaches based on feature data to help clinicians to identify high-risk patients as early as possible, to improve the prognosis of patients and to reduce the mortality of critically ill patients, are highly demanded and are of clinical significance. In this study, we used XGBoost machine learning method to establish a predictive model for early identification of critically ill patients based on the epidemiological and clinical data of 375 patients with COVID-19 infection in Tongji Hospital of Wuhan. The working mechanism of the XGBoost-based machine learning model is that it is detailed with quantitatively sorting clinical features accordingly to their criticality, then sorting out revealed features, and giving the interpretable clinical route. Inspiringly, with the assistance of such a model, we have extracted merely three key clinical features from all the 300+ features, i.e., LDH, hs-CRP and lymphocyte, which can precisely predict the survival with more than 90% accuracy. These three indexes correspond to the most important factors such as cell injury, cellular immunity and inflammation in the pathophysiological progress of COVID-19."

            "Coronavirus is prevalent in China and all over the world, with high morbidity and high mortality in critically ill patients. According to the recent reports [26], old patients are more prone to be infected by COVID-19, especially for those with underlying diseases. The severity of patients is applying great pressure on the shortage of intensive care resources. Unfortunately, so far, specific clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia in different critical stages remain still unclear. Under this circumstance, novel approaches based on feature data to help clinicians to identify high-risk patients as early as possible, to improve the prognosis of patients and to reduce the mortality of critically ill patients, are highly demanded and are of clinical significance. In this study, we used XGBoost machine learning method to establish a predictive model for early identification of critically ill patients based on the epidemiological and clinical data of 375 patients with COVID-19 infection in Tongji Hospital of Wuhan. The working mechanism of the XGBoost-based machine learning model is that it is detailed with quantitatively sorting clinical features accordingly to their criticality, then sorting out revealed features, and giving the interpretable clinical route. Inspiringly, with the assistance of such a model, we have extracted merely three key clinical features from all the 300+ features, i.e., LDH, hs-CRP and lymphocyte, which can precisely predict the survival with more than 90% accuracy. These three indexes correspond to the most important factors such as cell injury, cellular immunity and inflammation in the pathophysiological progress of COVID-19.",
            "The significance of our work is three-fold. First, instead of merely providing the high-risk factors as the earlier published articles, the present study has provided a general operable formula to precisely and quickly quantify the risk of death, representing a significant progress in clinical practice. For example, for patients with SPO2 below 93%, the respiratory support therapy include intranasal catheterization of oxygen, oxygen supply through mask, high flow oxygen supply through nasal catheter, non-invasive ventilation support, invasive ventilation support, and ECMO. However, the routine sequential usage of the oxygen therapy usually leads to unsatisfactory therapeutic effects in severe patients. Significantly, our predictive model is likely to identify high-risk patients before irreversible lesions occur. By using appropriate respiratory support therapy as soon as possible, we may be able to completely improve the prognosis. Second, these three revealed key features can be conveniently collected by any hospital, thus helping bypass large streams of patients crowded in top-tier hospitals. As a result, our model can substantially alleviate the pressure caused by the shortage of medical resources and facilitates the forming of hierarchical medical care system of COVID-19. Third, the millisecond machine learning speed of the present model could improve the efficiency of frontline doctors in term of classifying the severity and predicting the fatal development trend, thereby greatly releasing the heavy work load of doctors.",
            "The most common fatal complication of COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although the pathological features of COVID-19 are very similar to those by acute respiratory distress syndrome(SARS) and Middle East respiratory distress syndrome (MERS)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], it is known from the latest systematic anatomy that pulmonary fibrosis and consolidation by COVID-19 patients are not as serious as those caused by SARS, but the exudative reaction is more severe than that of SARS[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Histological examination of COVID-19 showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibro-myxoid Exudates, evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] and then interstitial fibrosis.",
            "The increase of LDH reflects tissue/cell destruction and is regarded as a common sign of tissue/cell damage. Serum LDH has been identified as an important biomarker for the activity and severity of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. In patients with severe pulmonary interstitial disease, the increase of LDH is significant and is one of the most important prognostic markers of lung injury[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. For the critically ill patients with COVID-19, the rise of LDH level indicates an increase of the activity and extent of lung injury.",
            "Our analysis showed that higher serum hs-CRP could be used to predict the risk of death in severe COVID-19 patients. The increase of hs-CRP, an important marker for poor prognosis in ARDS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>], reflects the persistent state of inflammation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. The result of this persistent inflammatory response is large gray-white lesions in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 (what was seen in the autopsy) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. In the tissue section, a large amount of sticky secretion was also seen overflowing from the alveoli [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "Our results also suggested that lymphocytes play vital role in forecasting of progression from mild to critically ill and may serve as a potential therapeutic target. The hypothesis is supported by the results of clinical studies [26]. Moreover, lymphopenia is a common feature in the patients with COVID-19 and might be a critical factor associated with disease severity and mortality[Error! Reference source not found.]. The injured alveolar epithelial cells could induce the infiltration of lymphocytes, leading to a persistent lymphopenia as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did, given that they share the similar alveolar penetrating and antigen presenting cells (APC) impairing pathway [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. A biopsy study has provided strong evidence that the counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells were substantially reduced, while their status was hyperactivated [Error! Reference source not found.]. Also, Jing and colleagues reported the lymphopenia is mainly related to the decrease of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Thus, it is likely that lymphocytes play distinct roles in COVID-19, which deserves further investigation.",
            "Nevertheless, this study has several notable limitations. First of all, since the proposed machine learning method is purely data driven, its model may vary given a different set of training and validation dataset. Given the limit number of samples in this study, we strike a balance between model complexity and performance. Yet the whole procedure should follow when more data is available.

            "In summary, in this study, we have identified three indicators (LDH, hs-CRP, and lymphocytes) and even found the early warning thresholds (LDH: 365U/l, hs-CRP: 41.2mg/L, and lymphocytes%: 14.7%) for COVID-19 prognostic prediction and developed an XGBoost machine learning-based prognostic model that can precisely predict the survival rates of severe patients with more than 90% accuracy, enabling the early detection, the early intervention and the reduction of mortality in high-risk patients with COVID-19. From technical point of view, this work helps pave the way for using machine learning method in COVID-19 prediction and diagnosis in the triage of the large scale explosive epidemic COVID-19 cases. Further studies are needed to consider more clinical confounding factors and to increase the sample size for further refining our model.",
