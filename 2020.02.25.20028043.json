It is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals. \nObjective: To detect the presence of COVID-19 in the samples from the area at risk of contamination in the First Hospital of Jilin University.\nMethods: Viruses in the air were collected by natural sedimentation and air particle sampler methods. Predetermined environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs at seven o'clock in the morning before disinfection. The real-time reverse-transcription PCR method was used to detect the existence of COVID-19 pathogens.\nResults: Viruses could be detected on the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients and in the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care patient.\nConclusion: Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during pandemic outbreaks is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control. It is of great significance to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control through the monitoring of environmental hygiene.",

        "discussion": [
            "Our positive results in nucleic acid tests indicated that viruses were present in the air of an isolation ward with intensive care patients. The hermetic spaces of isolation wards are weak in air flow, which may cause high contact with the virus. Additionally, the confirmed patient underwent tracheal intubation the day before the samples were collected, and this procedure produced large amounts of aerosols that spread in the wards and seriously polluted the air. Siegel et al reported that medical ventilators might generate respiratory aerosols that have been associated with an increased risk of occupationally acquired infections among healthcare personnel necessary to increase the intensity of disinfection for isolation wards with intensive care patients. For example, we should enhance ventilator exhaust management by adding ventilator exhaust port filters.<br/><br/>The suspected and confirmed patients stay a relatively long time in the high-risk area and may influence the environment. The intrusive and other operations that can easily produce aerosols may cause serious air pollution. The sites under observation without patients and operations have less impact on the environment. The samples from the same collection points were tested after a series of infection prevention and control measures were taken, such as continuous use of an air disinfection machine for the disinfection of ward air; extending the frequency of disinfection for ground and object surfaces; changing gloves and cleaning hands after operations and leaving the ward; and covering computer keyboards and changing the cover each day. Following the implementation of these measures, the results were negative, showing the [12]"

            "Our positive results in nucleic acid tests indicated that viruses were present in the air of an isolation ward with intensive care patients. The hermetic spaces of isolation wards are weak in air flow, which may cause high contact with the virus. Additionally, the confirmed patient underwent tracheal intubation the day before the samples were collected, and this procedure produced large amounts of aerosols that spread in the wards and seriously polluted the air. Siegel et al reported that medical ventilators might generate respiratory aerosols that have been associated with an increased risk of occupationally acquired infections among healthcare personnel necessary to increase the intensity of disinfection for isolation wards with intensive care patients. For example, we should enhance ventilator exhaust management by adding ventilator exhaust port filters.",
            "The suspected and confirmed patients stay a relatively long time in the high-risk area and may influence the environment. The intrusive and other operations that can easily produce aerosols may cause serious air pollution. The sites under observation without patients and operations have less impact on the environment. The samples from the same collection points were tested after a series of infection prevention and control measures were taken, such as continuous use of an air disinfection machine for the disinfection of ward air; extending the frequency of disinfection for ground and object surfaces; changing gloves and cleaning hands after operations and leaving the ward; and covering computer keyboards and changing the cover each day. Following the implementation of these measures, the results were negative, showing the [12]",
            ". Therefore, it is effectiveness of disinfection. In the high-risk areas, such as hospital pre-check triages and the fever clinic, due to the open environment and large amount of air flow, the results were negative.",
            "The previous research reports that the routine cleaning and disinfection procedures are the most likely cause of the deficiency of disinfection in the hospital environment, leading to the spread of pathogens surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients, suggesting that we need to strengthen the surface disinfection of nurse stations, especially focusing on computer keyboards, mice and types of equipment that are not easy to disinfect. A large number of studies have shown that the hands or gloves of medical staff members may be contaminated by contact with environmental surfaces contaminated by pathogens[13-15]. In the process of diagnosis and treatment, pathogens may be transmitted to patients and cause hospital-associated infections. Therefore, it is also very important to further strengthen the hand hygiene of the medical staff.",
            "We need to formulate refinement measures based on environmental hygiene monitoring data to improve the quality of hospital infection control. Due to fact that \u201cuncultivable\u201d microbes widely exist, traditional methods used to measure the effect of hospital infection control, such as sedimentation (exposing a microbial growth plate to the environment) have shown limited effects and poor sensitivity. For laboratories and testing organizations, high concentrations of nucleic acid may exist in aerosols, which may influence the test results and the operator\u2019s safety and may even cause spread of the disease. Nucleic acid detection provides an effective method with [13]",

In our study, viruses were detected on the which to monitor the environment and to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfection, especially for highly contagious diseases or pathogenic microorganisms with a potential aerosol risk, such as COVID-19. These nucleic acid detection results are very important for standardized hospital infection control. This study also increases our understanding of the environmental challenges corresponding to the reemergence of COVID-19 or similar viruses.",
            "The data obtained in this study suggest that COVID-19 exists in the air of isolation wards with intensive care patients and existed on the surfaces of nurse stations and that medical staff encounter this virus in the air and on surfaces during patient care activities. An effective disinfection procedure may reduce the biosafety risk.",
