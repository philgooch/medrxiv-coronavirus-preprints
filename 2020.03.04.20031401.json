            "To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field. Design This study is a review. Data sources Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020. Eligibility Criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered. Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 160 protocols. For protocols of TCM clinical trials, 76 outcomes from 16 outcome domains were reported, and almost half (34/76, 44.74%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turns to negative. 27 (27/76, 35.53%) outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 10 outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame. For protocols of western medicine clinical trials, 126 outcomes from 17 outcome domains were reported; almost half (62/126, 49.21%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was proportion of patients with negative SARS-CoV-2. 27 outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 40 (40/126, 31.75%) outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame. Conclusion Outcome reporting in protocols of clinical trials of COVID-19 is inconsistent. Thus, developing a core outcome set is necessary. Keywords: Outcomes; clinical trials, COVID-19; review."

            "At the same time, an increasing number of clinical trials are conducting. After searching some protocols of clinical trials from Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiTCR) and ClinicalTrials.gov, we found that different researchers chose different outcomes. It is very important for clinical trials to provide evidence in treating COVID-19. However, the heterogeneity of outcomes make it impossible to conduct meta-analysis in the future, which may reduce the value of clinical trials and improve waste.",
