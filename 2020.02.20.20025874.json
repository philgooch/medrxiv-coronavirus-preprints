        "abstract": "The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus  broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.",

            "In December 2019, the first case of cluster unidentified pneumonia was found in Wuhan, named 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a beta subtype, highly homologous with SARS[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. As of February 18, 2020, there were in total 75,201 confirmed cases worldwide. With the rapid spreading speed of R0 3.28, there is a heavy pressure for hospital assistant diagnosis, as some infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic method that is sensitive, accurate, rapid and low-cost to screen infected individuals, facilitate proper isolation and help controlling the disease spread.<br/><br/>For RNA virus infections, especially acute respiratory infection, probe coupled RT-qPCR from respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses [39]. This method has been widely used by Center for Disease Control and Prevention and other relevant departments worldwide. Recently RT-qPCR based methods were developed and applied worldwide by multiple research and disease control centers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. However, RT-qPCR has many limitations such as the need for high purity samples and the access to expensive laboratory instruments, as well as requiring long reaction times (at least 2 h). In addition, RT-qPCR needs trained personnel and sophisticated facilities for sample processing.

To confirm this, we repeated this sample multiple times with random positive signal, confirming that this samples was close to the detection threshold using 2\u03bcl. Currently most the RT-qPCR reactions in China for SARS-CoV-2 test use 5 \u03bcl sample input. We thereby checked whether increasing the used sample volume would facilitate the detection. However, increasing the volume of the loaded sample to 5 \u03bcl RNA sample lead to variable results.

The reaction time takes 20-30 minutes at 65\u00b0C.

Therefore the detection of COVID-19 is of vital importance. The first version of iLACO with six primers could specifically identify eight distinct regions of the ORF1ab target. Our blast analysis suggest that the highly specific primer set design have a low chance for unspecific amplifications (false positives)."

            "The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available."

            "In December 2019, the first case of cluster unidentified pneumonia was found in Wuhan, named 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a beta subtype, highly homologous with SARS[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. As of February 18, 2020, there were in total 75,201 confirmed cases worldwide. With the rapid spreading speed of R0 3.28, there is a heavy pressure for hospital assistant diagnosis, as some infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic method that is sensitive, accurate, rapid and low-cost to screen infected individuals, facilitate proper isolation and help controlling the disease spread.",
            "For RNA virus infections, especially acute respiratory infection, probe coupled RT-qPCR from respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses [39]. This method has been widely used by Center for Disease Control and Prevention and other relevant departments worldwide. Recently RT-qPCR based methods were developed and applied worldwide by multiple research and disease control centers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. However, RT-qPCR has many limitations such as the need for high purity samples and the access to expensive laboratory instruments, as well as requiring long reaction times (at least 2 h). In addition, RT-qPCR needs trained personnel and sophisticated facilities for sample processing. These disadvantages limit its practical application in many cases, and thus can delay the required rapid prescription and administration of antiviral agents to patients.",
            "Loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a technology that provides nucleic acid amplification in a short time using 4 to 6 specially designed primers and a DNA polymerase with chain displacement activity (Bst) under a constant temperature (60-65 )[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].

After the incubation, in addition to the colorimetric change, a ladder of DNA with increasing size was observed with on an agarose gel confirming the expected DNA amplification (Fig. 2C). The 5 sets of primers were further tested for efficiency and the primer group 4 (containing LB4) was chosen for further optimization, which showed the best sensitivity (data not shown). We also optimized the reaction temperature to 65\u00b0 degree, as we did not observe any positive signal using the recommended 72\u00b0 degree incubation previously used for ZIKA virus detection by LAMP assay[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. iLACO showed similar performance when we compared the samples from SARS-CoV-2 RNA or cDNA, indicating the one-step isothermal amplification is sufficient and separated step for reverse transcription is not necessary.",

Twenty minutes of reaction is sufficient to detect the signal (Fig. 2D). We notice the signal is stronger compared with incubation using a thermocycler commonly used for PCR . The longer incubation time caused the water drops on the top lid of the tube. To avoid this, we added few drops of mineral oil after adding all the required solutions. This set up can be further optimised by using micro Pasteur Pipettes coupled with thermo cups for processing.",

Further, we compared iLACO with RT-qPCR assay with the diluted RNA sample from patient number 200202(10 times dilution, SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration around 17 copies/ \u03bcl).. We observed the iLACO reaction time correlating well with RT-qPCR cycles. ie. 37 minutes color turning point correlated with 37 cycles (Fig. 3B and C). However, the 20 \u03bcl volume reaction time in 1.5 ml tubes incubated on wather bath are much fastercompared to RT-qPCR or samples processedin 0.2 ml tubes in PCR thermocycler, partially due to the increased heating volume and even surrounding temperature.",
            "To further expand the iLACO detection capability, we also checked the UV or Blue light stimulated fluorescence signal. We added SYBR green dye into the reaction mix prior to adding the sample. After 20 minutes incubation in 65 degree, the signal was observed with Gel imaging system (Fig. 4A). SYBR green in positive reactions was observed clearly in positive reaction. We also chose a new type of nucleic acid dye GeneFinderTM, which has enhanced fluorescent signal and sensitivity. By exposing under Blue light, green fluorescence was observed clearly with naked eye in the positive reaction, whereas it remained original pink in the negative control (Fig. 4B).",
