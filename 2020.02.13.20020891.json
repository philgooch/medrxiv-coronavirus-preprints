        "abstract": "Pockets of susceptibility resulting from spatial or social heterogeneity in vaccine coverage can drive measles outbreaks, as cases imported into such pockets are likely to cause further transmission and lead to large transmission clusters. Characterising the dynamics of transmission is essential for identifying which individuals and regions might be most at risk.\n\nAs data from detailed contact tracing investigations are not available in many settings, we combined age, location, genotype, and onset date of cases in order to probabilistically reconstruct the importation status and transmission clusters within a newly developed R package called o2geosocial. \n\nWe compared our inferred cluster size distributions to 737 transmission clusters identified through detailed contact-tracing in the United States between 2001 and 2016. We were able to reconstruct the importation status of the cases and found good agreement between the inferred and reference clusters. The results were improved when the contact-tracing investigations were used to set the importation status before running the model.\n\nSpatial heterogeneity in vaccine coverage is difficult to measure directly. Our approach was able to highlight areas with potential for local transmission using a minimal number of variables and could be applied to assess the intensity of ongoing transmission in a region.",

Transmission links can be reconstructed through contact tracing investigation, whereby cases are asked their movements and contacts during their infectious period. Given that contact-tracing investigations are not always carried out due to the logistical effort and cost involved, inference methods have been developed to use epidemiological data to estimate the probability that a transmission event occurred between any given pair of cases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. This makes it possible to establish probabilistic transmission trees that link all observed cases.<br/><br/>Wallinga and Teunis first developed a likelihood-based estimation procedure to reconstruct probabilistic transmission trees from a given distribution of generation times and observed symptom onset dates of each case[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Since then, genomic, spatial or contact data have been used to supplement the timing of symptoms, which helped identify determinants of transmission, mixing behaviour, individual dispersion, evaluate control measures, anticipate future developments of outbreaks and study viral evolutionary patterns[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]."

We defined f(ti \u2212 Ti ) as the probability density of observing Ti if case i was infected at time ti (i.e. f represents the distribution of incubation periods). The log-likelihood of transmission Lji was computed from five components reflecting the age group, genotype, location, and inferred date of infection of cases i and j, and the generation time of the disease: Lji (ti , tj ,  ) = log (p(\u03baji |\u03c1) \u2217 w (\u03baji) (ti \u2212 tj ) \u2217 a(\u03baji) (\u03b1i , \u03b1j ) \u2217 G(gi , g\u03c4j ) \u2217 s (\u03baji) (ri , rj | a, b))<br/><br/>We allowed for missing generations between cases due to an unreported individual, and \u03baji corresponds to the number of generations between i and j. We calculated the temporal probability of transmission between i and j from the number of days between the dates of infection of the two cases ti and tj and the generation time of the disease w(t). This probability of infection was quantified by w k (ti \u2212 tj , \u03baji ), w (\u03ba) = \u220f\u03ba w , where \u03a0 is the convolution operator. We used an exponential distribution p(\u03baji |\u03c1) to quantify the probability of observing \u03baji missing generation between i and j from the conditional report ratio \u03c1 which quantifies the probability of missing generation between two connected cases in a cluster."

            "We clustered 2,077 measles cases reported in the United States between January 2001 and December using their onset date, age groups, location and genotype. Using the contact tracing investigations, we considered three different initial importation status distribution: i) only the ancestors of each epidemiological cluster (first case of each cluster) were importations (ideal importation), ii) all cases classified as importation in the contact tracing investigations were importations (epidemiological importation), iii) no prior information on importation status of cases. The importation status of the cases was therefore not probabilistically inferred in scenario 1 and 2. The short preliminary run was 30,000 iterations and 70,000 iterations. For each run, the trace of the posterior distribution shows the convergence of the algorithm (Supplement Figure S3).<br/><br/>In scenario 1, we did not infer the importation status of cases. The inferred cluster size distribution matched the contact tracing investigations (Figure 4A); 98% of the reference singletons were also isolated in the inferred cluster. For 94% (95% Credibility Interval: 91-98%) of cases, the inferred cluster had a sensitivity and precision above 75%, meaning more than 75% of the cases in the inferred cluster were in the reference cluster, and more than 75% of the cases in the reference cluster were in the inferred cluster (Figure 4B). For 80% (78 \u2013 93%) of cases, the inferred clusters were a perfect match with the reference clusters. The cluster size distribution stratified by state was similar to the contact tracing investigations (Supplement Figure S4). Therefore, when each ancestor was considered as an importation, the inferred clusters were very close to the reference ones."

        "discussion": [
            "We developed the R package o2geosocial to classify measles cases into transmission clusters and estimate their importation status using routinely collected surveillance data (genotype, age, onset date and location of the cases). As recently observed during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak in New York, delays in childhood vaccination, local susceptibility, and increased contacts can lead to large outbreaks following importations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. Therefore, we were interested in highlighting the effect of imported cases on communities and we focused on short distance transmission to identify areas where they repeatedly caused subsequent transmission chains. Although this is not predictive of future transmission, it highlights communities with potential for large transmission clusters.<br/><br/>We compared the inferred transmission clusters to the contact tracing investigations of 2,077 confirmed measles cases reported in the United States between 2001 and 2016. We were able to produce reliable estimates of known transmission clusters using epidemiological features with only few misclassifications. Estimating the importation status of cases without prior knowledge was challenging and caused uncertainty on the results. We tested different threshold \u03bb to eliminate unlikely transmissions, and we were able to identify most of the imported cases. Nevertheless, if several cases were imported in the same region at a similar time, we could not find all of them without discarding valid transmission events, and increasing the number of false positives. When we used the importation status as defined in the contact tracing investigations without probabilistic inference (scenario 1 and 2), the reconstructed clusters were similar to the reference ones. Results were also conclusive when we combined prior information and importation inference. The reconstruction of transmission greatly depends on the epidemiological investigations to identify measles importations in a community."

        "conclusions": [
            "Heterogeneity in immunity can cause large outbreaks in countries with high national vaccine coverage, and identifying potential foyers of transmission in post-elimination settings is key for outbreak prevention and control. We have presented a method for estimating the cluster size distribution of past measles outbreaks from routinely collected surveillance data. We found that adding prior knowledge on the importation status of cases improved the inference of the transmission clusters. Although the method was able to identify a proportion of importations, epidemiological investigations on the history of travel and exposure reduced uncertainty on the clustering of cases. We believe these investigations are needed to produce reliable estimates of past transmission clusters. In lieu of the importation status, if multiple genotypes are co-circulating, increasing the proportion of genotyped cases could help discard potential connections and find imported cases. Even with limited information, this method was able to infer probabilistic transmission clusters in a fast and efficient way."

            "Establishing who infected whom during an outbreak can help inform the design and evaluation of control measures[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Transmission links can be reconstructed through contact tracing investigation, whereby cases are asked their movements and contacts during their infectious period. Given that contact-tracing investigations are not always carried out due to the logistical effort and cost involved, inference methods have been developed to use epidemiological data to estimate the probability that a transmission event occurred between any given pair of cases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. This makes it possible to establish probabilistic transmission trees that link all observed cases.",
            "Wallinga and Teunis first developed a likelihood-based estimation procedure to reconstruct probabilistic transmission trees from a given distribution of generation times and observed symptom onset dates of each case[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Since then, genomic, spatial or contact data have been used to supplement the timing of symptoms, which helped identify determinants of transmission, mixing behaviour, individual dispersion, evaluate control measures, anticipate future developments of outbreaks and study viral evolutionary patterns[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>].",
            "As sequencing of pathogens has become more common, the use of such data to infer transmission trees has increased. Methods developed to add genetic distance to a Wallinga-Teunis algorithm, where cases with lower genetic distance are more likely to be grouped in the same transmission group, showed it substantially increased the accuracy of the reconstructed transmission trees[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].",
            "The utility of sequence data depends on the characteristics of the pathogen[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Based on N-450 sequence data, eight measles genotypes have been detected since 2009[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]; these genotype designations are helpful in linking cases, as linked cases must be infected by virus of the same genotype[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]; however, the diversity of measles genotypes is decreasing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. It has been suggested that further sequencing the M-F non-coding region, or full genome sequencing, could help identify measles virus transmission trees, but so far, extended sequencing during measles outbreaks has been scarce[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. In addition, the evolutionary rate of measles virus is very low[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>], therefore, samples from unrelated cases can be very close genetically and genetic sequences from measles cases are not usually indicative of direct transmission links[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>].",
            "As measles is highly infectious, under-immunized communities (also called pockets of susceptibles) resulting from local heterogeneity in vaccine coverage can lead to large, long-lasting outbreaks[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>].",
            "Detecting these pockets of susceptibles can be challenging, as historical local values of coverage throughout a given country are rarely available. The size distribution of transmission trees resulting from each importation during outbreaks (otherwise known as the cluster size distribution) will depend both on individual factors (e.g. age of the imported case which might affect contact patterns) and community factors (e.g. the history of coverage in the area)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. The size of a cluster can therefore reflect the level of susceptibility of individuals directly and indirectly connected to the index case [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>].",
            "Here we introduced a model combining age, location, genotype, and rash onset date of cases to reconstruct probabilistic transmission trees. We chose these features to make the model applicable to a wide range of settings as they are commonly reported and informative on transmission. We wrote the",

We used the likelihood of transmission links between different cases to estimate their importation status.

            "We used a probabilistic model to infer the individual contribution to the log-likelihood Li of every case included in the list of cases.",
            "Li was computed from Lji ( ), the log-likelihood of case i being infected by case j as a function of infection times ti and tj and model parameters  , and the timing of ti , the date of infection of i, relative to the date of symptom onset Ti . We defined f(ti \u2212 Ti ) as the probability density of observing Ti if case i was infected at time ti (i.e. f represents the distribution of incubation periods). The log-likelihood of transmission Lji was computed from five components reflecting the age group, genotype, location, and inferred date of infection of cases i and j, and the generation time of the disease: Lji (ti , tj ,  ) = log (p(\u03baji |\u03c1) \u2217 w (\u03baji) (ti \u2212 tj ) \u2217 a(\u03baji) (\u03b1i , \u03b1j ) \u2217 G(gi , g\u03c4j ) \u2217 s (\u03baji) (ri , rj | a, b))",
            "We allowed for missing generations between cases due to an unreported individual, and \u03baji corresponds to the number of generations between i and j. We calculated the temporal probability of transmission between i and j from the number of days between the dates of infection of the two cases ti and tj and the generation time of the disease w(t). This probability of infection was quantified by w k (ti \u2212 tj , \u03baji ), w (\u03ba) = \u220f\u03ba w , where \u03a0 is the convolution operator. We used an exponential distribution p(\u03baji |\u03c1) to quantify the probability of observing \u03baji missing generation between i and j from the conditional report ratio \u03c1 which quantifies the probability of missing generation between two connected cases in a cluster.",
            "It does not correspond to the overall report ratio of an outbreak as entire missing clusters, or unreported cases infected after the last case or before the ancestor of a cluster are not included in \u03c1. The \u201cancestor\u201d",

            "a(\u03b1i , \u03b1j , \u03baji ) was defined as the probability of transmission between age groups \u03b1i and \u03b1j . This probability corresponds to the proportion of contacts to the age group \u03b1i that originated from \u03b1j and can be deduced from studies such as Polymod[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. We defined G (gi , g\u03c4j ) as the probability of observing the pathogen genotype gi in case i in the tree \u03c4j containing case j. There can only be one measles virus genotype per transmission tree, or cases with unreported genotype.",

            "We used a gravity model to quantify the connectivity of the different geographical units. In the simplest form of the gravity approach, the number of connections between two counties k and l is proportional to the product of the origin population mk , the destination population ml and a function of the distance between k and l dkl : pkl \u221d f(dkl, a) \u2217 mbk \u2217 mcl , with a, b, and c parameters adjusting for the impact of distance and population. From this definition, we deduced s(k, l), the probability of transmission from an individual from region k to another from region l: s(k, l) =",
            "Only the parameters a and b were required to compute the spatial probability of transmission. We used the exponential gravity model (f(dkl , a) = e \u2212a\u2217dkl )[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]. This approach showed good performance at modelling short distance commuting, and was easy to parametrise[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>].",
            "In order to compute the log-posterior densities of the proposed trees, we summed the individual loglikelihoods and added log-priors on the report ratio \u03c1, which quantified the percentage of cases in the chains reported to the surveillance system; and the spatial parameters a and b (Table 1).",
            "We used a Metropolis Hastings algorithm with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from the posterior distribution of parameters and the transmission trees. To do this, we developed a set of proposal tree updates. These updates were accepted with acceptance probability as defined by the",
            "Metropolis-Hastings algorithm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. We used eight types of tree proposal to ensure good mixing. Each proposal conserved the overall number of trees, with a maximum of one unique genotype reported per tree.",
            "Five of the proposals had already been implemented in the outbreaker2 package and were adapted to this setting: i) change the number of generations between two cases; ii) change the conditional report ratio \u03c1; iii) change the time of infection; iv) change the infector of a case (if the case is not the ancestor of a tree); v) swap infector-infectee (if none is the ancestor of a tree).",
            "We added two proposals to change a and b, the spatial kernel parameters. For each proposal, the probability of transmission between every geographical unit was re calculated with the new values.",
            "Depending on the number of geographical units, this calculation considerably slowed down the algorithm. Therefore, when a or b were estimated, we limited the maximal number of missing generations to 1 (max(\u03baji ) = 2). Finally, the last proposal was designed to change the ancestor of the tree whilst conserving the overall number of trees (Figure 1).",
            "Unrelated measles cases stemming from different importations and different regions can be part of the same dataset. Grouping cases and excluding unrealistic transmission links reduces the number of possible trees and speeds up the MCMC runs. To do so, we listed each case\u2019s potential infectors using three criteria: i) The potential infectors must be of the same genotype as the case, or have unreported genotype, ii) The location of potential infectors must be less than \u03b3 km away from the case and iii) the potential infectors must have been reported later than \u03b4 days before the case. This threshold should be determined from the maximum plausible generation time of the disease. The spatial threshold \u03b3 should be defined according to the relevance of long-distance transmissions. Cases with no potential infector were considered as importations. Otherwise, they were grouped together with i) their potential infectors and ii) cases with common potential infectors.",
            "After grouping the cases, we estimated their importation status and the cluster size distribution using two runs of MCMC (Figure 2). The first run was shorter and aimed at removing the most unlikely connections among each group, as they can reflect unrealistic estimates for incubation periods or generation times and corrupt the estimation of the date of infection. We defined a reference threshold \u03bb, whereby if the individual value of log-likelihood Li was worse than \u03bb, then the connection between i and their index was considered unlikely. In Outbreaker2, \u03bb was a relative value, defined from a quantile of the individual log-likelihoods. In o2geosocial, \u03bb can be a relative value or an absolute value, chosen from the number of components of the likelihood. For each sample saved from the short run, we computed the number of unlikely connections n. If there was no iteration where all connections where better than \u03bb, min(n) new importations were added to the initial tree for the long run (Figure 2).",
            "Finally, we ran a long MCMC chain and obtained samples from the posterior distribution. After removing the burn-in period and thinning the chain, we deleted the unlikely transmission links in each iteration and identified transmission clusters. Therefore, unlike the previous versions of outbreaker2, the number of importations in each sample can vary and the individual probability of being an importation can be computed (Figure 2).",

Not every identified case could be linked to an importation, and some transmission clusters contained multiple imported cases (e.g. when related individuals travel together to a foreign country and were infected there). Out of the 737 reference clusters, 38 had several cases classified as importations, 256 had none identified.",

The importation status of the cases was therefore not probabilistically inferred in scenario 1 and 2. The short preliminary run was 30,000 iterations and 70,000 iterations. For each run, the trace of the posterior distribution shows the convergence of the algorithm (Supplement Figure S3).",

For 80% (78 \u2013 93%) of cases, the inferred clusters were a perfect match with the reference clusters. The cluster size distribution stratified by state was similar to the contact tracing investigations (Supplement Figure S4). Therefore, when each ancestor was considered as an importation, the inferred clusters were very close to the reference ones.",

Pre-clustering highlighted 165 cases with no potential infector, which were also classified as importations. We observed discrepancies between the inferred cluster size distribution and the reference one: Among the 704 cases inferred as importation, 61 (9%) were not importations in the reference cluster. Furthermore, 94 cases were the ancestor of a reference cluster and were not classified as importations in the inferred clusters (13%). The overall cluster size distribution matched the reference distribution, but 111 reference singletons were inferred as part of transmission clusters (Figure 4A, Supplement Figure S5).

Therefore, increasing \u03bb did not improve the cluster size distribution, as many importations in the reference clusters were not identified and the number of mismatches increased (Supplement Figures S7).",
            "Finally, we combined prior information and inference of importation status. Cases considered as importations in the contact tracing investigations were set as importations, and we inferred the importation status of the remaining cases. We used a low threshold, to remove the least likely transmission links (k = 0.05). Including prior information led to some misclassification of importation status due to the inconsistencies between the epidemiological importation status and the reference clusters. As in scenario 2, some cases were classified with only part of their reference clusters because clusters with several importations were split into different clusters. Indeed, the sensitivity score of 34%",

This number is not representative of the overall report ratio, which is usually much lower[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>], and does not take into account missing importations in singletons and chains.

            "We highlighted the added value of including the spatial distance between cases in the likelihood by comparing the cluster size distribution inferred by selecting certain components of Li (Supplement",
            "Figure S11). The credibility intervals were much wider when the distance between cases is not part of the likelihood, and the number of chains containing 2 to 10 cases was over estimated. The important impact of the spatial component of likelihood was also due to the widespread American territory, and could be lower in a different setting.",
            "We used the ratio of the number of importations over the number of subsequent cases per state to evaluate the intensity of transmission in each state between 2001 and 2016 (Figure 6). The maps obtained in the scenario 1 (ideal scenario) or in scenario 3 (estimation of importation, with epidemiological importations and k = 0.05) were very similar. We only observed minor differences, for example in South Dakota and in Massachusetts, where the ratios were higher in scenario 3. The highest ratio (31.8 in scenario 1) was observed in Ohio, and is mostly due to a 383 case outbreak in",

Indeed, although 403 cases were reported in California (highest number in the US), importations caused on average 1.32 subsequent cases in scenario 1 (1.60 in scenario 3), showing a high proportion of reported cases were inferred as importations.",
            "Similarly, we used the inferred transmission chain to compute the inferred reproduction number in each state. According to the model, about 60% cases did not cause future transmission, and about 5% caused more than 5 subsequent cases (Supplement Figure S12). These numbers were consistent in each run.",
            "The geographical distribution of reproduction number was very similar to the importation - subsequent cases ratio (Supplement Figure S13)."

        "Discussion": [
            "We developed the R package o2geosocial to classify measles cases into transmission clusters and estimate their importation status using routinely collected surveillance data (genotype, age, onset date and location of the cases). As recently observed during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak in New York, delays in childhood vaccination, local susceptibility, and increased contacts can lead to large outbreaks following importations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. Therefore, we were interested in highlighting the effect of imported cases on communities and we focused on short distance transmission to identify areas where they repeatedly caused subsequent transmission chains. Although this is not predictive of future transmission, it highlights communities with potential for large transmission clusters.",
            "We compared the inferred transmission clusters to the contact tracing investigations of 2,077 confirmed measles cases reported in the United States between 2001 and 2016. We were able to produce reliable estimates of known transmission clusters using epidemiological features with only few misclassifications. Estimating the importation status of cases without prior knowledge was challenging and caused uncertainty on the results. We tested different threshold \u03bb to eliminate unlikely transmissions, and we were able to identify most of the imported cases. Nevertheless, if several cases were imported in the same region at a similar time, we could not find all of them without discarding valid transmission events, and increasing the number of false positives. When we used the importation status as defined in the contact tracing investigations without probabilistic inference (scenario 1 and 2), the reconstructed clusters were similar to the reference ones. Results were also conclusive when we combined prior information and importation inference. The reconstruction of transmission greatly depends on the epidemiological investigations to identify measles importations in a community.",
            "We used the genotype to censor connections between cases when it was reported, as there can be only one reported genotype per transmission cluster. Using a simulated dataset (toy_outbreak_long in o2geosocial), we explored the impact of increasing the proportion of genotyped cases on clustering and observed it could help identify the number of concurrent transmission trees when multiple genotypes are co-circulating. Moreover, we introduced a spatial component to the likelihood of connection between cases using an exponential gravity model. Previous studies showed this model was able to capture short distance dynamics better than other gravity models, and was easy to parametrise.",
            "Introducing the spatial component greatly improved the precision and the sensitivity of the reconstructed clusters (Supplement Figure S11), and the parameter estimates were robust in the different scenarios.",
            "The final results on the clustering of the 2,077 cases using o2geosocial were obtained in 7 hours for each run of 100,000 iterations on a standard desktop computer (Intel Core i7, 3.20 GHz 6 cores), which is much faster than previous implementations of outbreaker and outbreaker2. With the addition of the pre-clustering step, whereby we reduced the number of potential infectors for each case, the algorithm ran faster. For smaller chains (50,000 iterations), 4 hours were needed to estimate the importation status and cluster the cases. The code for the package and the analysis developed in this project is shared on",
            "Github (https://github.com/alxsrobert/o2geosocial and alxsrobert/datapaperMO), with an illustrative toy dataset, and can be used to analyse recent outbreaks where contact-tracing investigations were not carried out.",
            "Although the results obtained are promising, it should be noted that the dynamics of measles transmission in the United States are likely to be very specific to this location. Indeed, there were less than 700 annual cases between 2001 and 2016. These cases were scattered across a large area, which made the pre-clustering of cases very efficient as we focused on short-distance transmission. In smaller or more endemic settings, the number of potential infectors per cases after the pre-clustering step might be higher, which would increase the running time.",
            "Furthermore, as the location of each case was deduced from the population centroid of counties, we assumed that the distance between cases from the same county was effectively zero. American counties are large and widespread geographical units that can include more than 1 million individuals. For future use of o2geosocial, more accurate information on the location of cases could improve cluster inference by identifying multiple importations in a given county. Because cases are reported by the state of residency, we had to ignore that cases may have been out of the reported county or state during their incubation and infectious period, which has been seen during some outbreaks, such as the 2015 \u201cDisney outbreak\u201d in California[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>].",
            "We did not include prior information on the local susceptibility of the different areas affected in o2geosocial, and these could be estimated using historical values of local coverage. However, protocols to estimate local vaccination coverage can differ in time and space and be difficult to compare, or unavailable at the local level. Furthermore, these estimates are cross-sectional in nature, and might not take into account catch-up vaccination campaigns, or immunity induced by previous outbreaks. Local seroprevalence surveys could identify pockets of susceptibles, but they have not been carried out on a subnational scale in most countries[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>].",

            "United States yielded similar results[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>]. POLYMOD data was probably the most reliable source of information we could use to deduce an estimate of the contact matrix in the United States."

        "Conclusions": [
            "Heterogeneity in immunity can cause large outbreaks in countries with high national vaccine coverage, and identifying potential foyers of transmission in post-elimination settings is key for outbreak prevention and control. We have presented a method for estimating the cluster size distribution of past measles outbreaks from routinely collected surveillance data. We found that adding prior knowledge on the importation status of cases improved the inference of the transmission clusters. Although the method was able to identify a proportion of importations, epidemiological investigations on the history of travel and exposure reduced uncertainty on the clustering of cases. We believe these investigations are needed to produce reliable estimates of past transmission clusters. In lieu of the importation status, if multiple genotypes are co-circulating, increasing the proportion of genotyped cases could help discard potential connections and find imported cases. Even with limited information, this method was able to infer probabilistic transmission clusters in a fast and efficient way."
