        "abstract": "Objective: To determine the predictive value of CT and clinical characteristics for short-term disease progression in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). \nMaterials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. \nResults: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P &gt; 0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P &lt; 0.05).\nConclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.",

The early predictive value of NLR has been reported in a recent study.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate the role of CT to predict disease progression in patients with NCP.

Like SARS and MERS, some NCP patients progressed rapidly at about 10-14 days after onset likely dues to the cytokine storm in the body as evidenced by increased plasma proinflammatory cytokines.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Our results further revealed the significant association between inflammatory markers and CT characteristics, especially for C-reactive protein and CT severity score, which indicated the potential value of CT to estimate pulmonary inflammation and lung damage.

However, the reason for this discrepancy between imported and nonimported patients remains to be elucidated.",
            "The patients who were admitted more than 4 days after symptom onset had more severe lung involvement, which likely attributed to the lung involvement progression as disease course extends. Song et al found that more consolidation and less GGO lesions in patients with an interval > 4 days between symptom onset and CT scan.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] Thus, early admission and surveillance by CT is crucial for the individual management of patients with NCP.",
            "There were some limitations in our study. First, our study retrospectively included 141 patients with moderate NCP on admission from one single city outside Wuhan. Data from multiple cities are needed to further validate our findings. Second, dynamic inflammatory indexes and treatment during hospitalization were not included in the analysis. More comprehensive investigation of the relationship between CT characteristics and cytokine storm induced by COVID-2019 needs to be performed.",
            "In conclusion, our results showed that higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP. The CT findings in patients with NCP were associated with inflammatory levels and both them have the potential to predict disease progression. Imported and nonimported patients outside Wuhan should be managed equally, and early admission is required for avoiding severe pulmonary damage."
