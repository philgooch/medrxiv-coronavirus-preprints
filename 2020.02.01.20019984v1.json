        "abstract": "A novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, China and has been causing an unprecedented outbreak in China. The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence.",

The cause of the pneumonia was later identified as a novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) genetically very closely related to the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARSCoV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. This marks the third time in 20 years that a member of the family of coronaviruses (CoVs) has caused an epidemic employing its zoonotic potential, for example, from bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The novel virus was able to establish between person-to-person transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].<br/><br/>The outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently occurring in Wuhan and affecting many neighboring cities and countries [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. During the early phase of the outbreak, it poses a severe threat to many other regions due to frequent transportation services linking Wuhan to the other cities.

            "A novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, China and has been causing an unprecedented outbreak in China. The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence.",
            "Here, we have developed a mathematical framework incorporating city-to-city connections to calculate the number of imported cases of the novel virus from an outbreak source, and the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases. We used this number to estimate the arrival time of outbreak emergence using air travel frequency data from Wuhan to other cities, collected from the International Air Transport Association database. In addition, a meta-population compartmental model was built based on a classical SIR approach to simulate outbreaks at different cities.",
            "We consider the scenarios under three basic reproductive number  \" settings using the best knowledge of the current findings, from high (2.92), mild (1.68), to a much lower numbers (1.4). The mean arrival time of outbreak spreading has been determined. Under the high  \", the critical time is 17.9 days after December 31, 2019 for outbreak spreading. Under the low  \", the critical time is between day 26.2 to day 35 after December 31, 2019. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low  \" (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the connections between the source and target cities. Under the higher  \" (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is generally low until the border control measure was enhanced to reduce more than 95% of the connections."

        "Introduction": [
            "On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia infections in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The cause of the pneumonia was later identified as a novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) genetically very closely related to the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARSCoV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. This marks the third time in 20 years that a member of the family of coronaviruses (CoVs) has caused an epidemic employing its zoonotic potential, for example, from bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The novel virus was able to establish between person-to-person transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
            "The outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently occurring in Wuhan and affecting many neighboring cities and countries [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. During the early phase of the outbreak, it poses a severe threat to many other regions due to frequent transportation services linking Wuhan to the other cities. About 2 weeks later after 31 December, using the number of cases detected outside China, it has been inferred that more than a thousand individuals (with an estimated mean",
            "1723) had had an onset of symptoms by January 12, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. This number, which was estimated based on certain assumptions, was about 40 times higher than the reported number by January 12, 2020. Given that most of the members of the coronavirus family cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection and most people have not yet received nation-wide alert about the novel virus during that period, it could be possible that the confirmed case number among actual infected cases is very low, probably similar to influenza reporting rate, which is only about 1% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
            "During this early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important preventive tasks is to prevent the outbreak potential to spread to other cities. If outbreaks also occur in other cities, the prevention of nCoV becomes even more difficult in China or at the global level. From disease control perspective, the major questions here are whether we can i) estimate the waiting time for nCoV to spread to other cities in China; and ii) evaluate the impacts of disease control by cessation of population movement (e.g., lockdown measures) on the outbreak spreading. The importance of prediction of infectious diseases based on transportation network information has already been highlighted previously [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Studies have been done to estimate the probability of emergence and the arrival time of the emergence [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. In addition, the required condition for a virus to spread to other cities is through secondary infections from the imported cases. In our study, imported case was defined as an infected individual migrating from other cities to a particular city. In order to evaluate the infectious disease control measures during the spreading of the virus, it is important to know how many secondary cases has been caused by the imported cases. Thus, there is a need to estimate the probability of emergence and the arrival time of the emergence through estimating the number of secondary infections caused from imported cases using transportation data.",
            "In this study, we derived a simple mathematical formula to estimate the outbreak potential at neighboring cities and built a meta-population model based on a classical SIR approach to understand the outbreak spreading dynamics at different cities. Gain of time before outbreak emergence is predicted under different infectious disease control rates."

        "Results": [
            "For each city, the critical time at which the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases larger than the critical threshold were determined (Table 1). Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and and Chengdu had the shortest required time periods. As stated before , the mean critical time for the top 10 visiting cities was 17.9 days. As shown in Figure 1,only eleven cities had higher risk of outbreak emergence (probability larger than 0.5).",
            "In reality, the  \" or real-time effective   will decrease after many control measures are conducted [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].

The changes of  4 by time at each city are plotted from day 1 to 50 (Figure 3A). After 50 days since the outbreak, the cumulative cases can reach rapidly above 40 cases for many cities. After 30 days, most of the cities have secondary cases above a critical threshold of 7.27, calculated from eq(4) using  \" = 1.1. The current estimate of  \" is 2.92 for the initial outbreak period in Wuhan when citizens had not received any alert. However, the current  \" would be lower because people have since been aware of the disease. This setting will apply when about 62.3% of infections events can be prevented, due to different control policies, comparing to the Wuhan outbreak before the emergence of outbreak on other cities.",
            "The outbreak potential of nearby cities can be assessed. For each city, the critical time at which the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases larger than the critical threshold was determined (Table 2). Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou had the shortest required time periods. The mean critical time from the top 10 visiting cities was 26.2 days. Only five cities had higher risk of outbreak emergence (probability larger than 0.5). We further calculated the probability of outbreak emergence at mean critical time and at day 35. 17 cities had higher risk of outbreak emergence (Table 2). We further compared the predicted cumulated infected case number at day 26 using model simulation with the actual observed reports in the top 10 visitng cities. Among top 5 high risk cities, four of them had higher case numbers than other cities. The higher number of predicted numbers confirmed that the actual case number can be 20 times higher than the reported numbers ( see suplemnetary Table S1).",

            "Under the no-border control scenario, assuming all other cities have the same population as Wuhan, model simulation results showed that nearly 2 months were required for generating the same level of epidemics in other frequent visiting cities (Figure 5). Ideally, complete cessation of population movement between cities or isolation of every susceptible case from the source city can reduce transmission events.",

            "To achieve the gain time of control for transportation of a particular city, we calculate critical time given the control such that the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases is greater than critical threshold number  . Finally, subtraction of the critical time without control from the critical time with control returns gain of the control system. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low  \" (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the secondary infections generated by the imported cases (Figure 6A).
