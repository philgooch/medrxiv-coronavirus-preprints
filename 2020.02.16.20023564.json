        "abstract": "An ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is hitting Wuhan City and has spread to other provinces/cities of China and overseas. It very urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between Feb 28 and Mar 10, 2020, with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. To our knowledge this is the first study revealing that the Boltzmann function is suitable to simulate epidemics. The estimated potential total number of confirmed cases and key dates for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may provide certain guidance for governments, organizations and citizens to optimize preparedness and response efforts.",

            "Data collection and Assessment<br/><br/>In light of daily reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 since Jan 21, 2020, we decided to collect data for analysis on the cumulative number of confirmed cases (initially from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020) in several typical regions of China, including the center of the outbreak (i.e. Wuhan City and Hubei<br/><br/>Province), other top provinces ranking in the number of cases (i.e., Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiang Provinces) and top-4 major cities in China (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen).<br/><br/>During data analysis on Feb 13, 2020, the number of new confirmed cases on Feb 12 in Hubei<br/><br/>Province and Wuhan City suddenly increased by 14840 and 13436, respectively, of which 13332 and 12364 are those confirmed by clinical features (note: all the number of confirmed cases released by Feb 12 were counted according to the result of viral nucleic acid detection rather than by referring to clinical features). Afterward, new confirmed cases determined by clinical criteria in Hubei Province on Feb 13 and 4 are still up to 2052 and 1138. In view of these, we arbitrarily distributed these suddenly added cases to the reported cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14 for Hubei Province by a fixed factor (refer to Table S1), assuming that these newly added cases were linearly accumulative in those days. It is the same forth with the data for Wuhan City.<br/><br/>Fitting data on the confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 to Boltzmann function and estimating the potential total number of confirmed cases"

        "discussion": [
            "<strong>Discussion and conclusion</strong><br/><br/>It is of significance to estimate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak originating in Wuhan, China. In particular, a precise estimation of the potential total number of infected cases and/or confirmed cases is critical for optimal preparedness and implementation of infection control practices made by governments nationally and locally. An earlier study published on 17 January [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] suggested that a total of 1,723 cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan City (95% CI: 4274,471) had onset of symptoms by 12th January 2020, which was calculated based on the internationally reported cases. Later, Wu et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] applied a susceptible-exposed-infectiousrecovered (SEIR) metapopulation model to simulate the epidemics of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak across all major cities in China on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China, and they estimated that 75 815 individuals (95% CI 37 304\u2013130 330)<br/><br/>had been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. A recent study based on the Susceptible-InfectedRecovered-Dead (SIRD) model revealed that the cumulative number of infected cases will surpass 68,000 (as a lower bound) and could reach 140,000 (with an upper bound of 290,000) by<br/><br/>February 29 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Notably, Huang and Qiao proposed a simple and data driven model based on the physics of natural growth algorithm and estimated the transmission rate of the SARSCoV-2 outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. The results of these modeling studies have provided important guidance for governments and health agencies to intensify preparedness and response efforts."

We assumed that the relative uncertainty follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 10%. This implies that all reported cases are positive but there is a tendency to miss-reporting some positive cases so that the reported numbers represent a lower limit. The resulting mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) were presented."

        "Results": [
            "In light of daily reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 since Jan 21, 2020, we decided to collect data for analysis on the cumulative number of confirmed cases (initially from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020) in several typical regions of China, including the center of the outbreak (i.e. Wuhan City and Hubei",
            "Province), other top provinces ranking in the number of cases (i.e., Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiang Provinces) and top-4 major cities in China (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen).",
            "During data analysis on Feb 13, 2020, the number of new confirmed cases on Feb 12 in Hubei",
            "Province and Wuhan City suddenly increased by 14840 and 13436, respectively, of which 13332 and 12364 are those confirmed by clinical features (note: all the number of confirmed cases released by Feb 12 were counted according to the result of viral nucleic acid detection rather than by referring to clinical features). Afterward, new confirmed cases determined by clinical criteria in Hubei Province on Feb 13 and 4 are still up to 2052 and 1138. In view of these, we arbitrarily distributed these suddenly added cases to the reported cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14 for Hubei Province by a fixed factor (refer to Table S1), assuming that these newly added cases were linearly accumulative in those days. It is the same forth with the data for Wuhan City.",
            "Fitting analyses using Boltzmann function indicate that all sets of data were well fitted with the function (all R2 values being close to 0.999; Figs. 1, 2 and S1). Parameter A2 in the Boltzmann function directly represents the potential total number of confirmed cases (refer to equation 1).",
            "As summarized in Table 1, the potential total number of confirmed cases for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces were estimated as 72800\u00b1600, 59300\u00b1600, 42100\u00b1700 and 12800\u00b1100; respectively (also refer to Fig. 1); those for the six mostly influenced provinces (Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi) were 1300\u00b110, 1170\u00b110, 1260\u00b110, 1050\u00b110, 1020\u00b110 and 940\u00b110, respectively (also refer to Fig. 2); those for the top-4 major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen) were 394\u00b14, 328\u00b13, 337\u00b13 and 397\u00b14, respectively (also refer to Fig. S1).",
            "The above analyses were performed assuming that the released data on the confirmed cases are precise. However, there is a tendency to miss-report some positive cases such that the reported numbers represent a lower limit. One typical example indicating this uncertainty is the sudden increase of more than 13 000 new confirmed cases in Hubei province on Feb 12 after clinical features were officially accepted as a standard for infection confirmation. Another uncertainty might result from insufficient kits for viral nucleic acid detection at the early stage of the outbreak.",
            "We thus examined the effects of the uncertainty of the released data on the estimation of the potential total number of confirmed cases using a Monte Carlo method (for detail, refer to the",

It appears that it will take approximately two weeks for mainland China to reach this state such that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARSCoV-2 post the critical date is below 70.",
            "Under the above conditions, the potential total numbers of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 for different regions were estimated (Figs. 3, S2 and S3) and summarized in Table 1. The potential total numbers for China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were 79589 (95% CI",

        "Discussion and conclusion": [
            "It is of significance to estimate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak originating in Wuhan, China. In particular, a precise estimation of the potential total number of infected cases and/or confirmed cases is critical for optimal preparedness and implementation of infection control practices made by governments nationally and locally. An earlier study published on 17 January [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] suggested that a total of 1,723 cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan City (95% CI: 4274,471) had onset of symptoms by 12th January 2020, which was calculated based on the internationally reported cases. Later, Wu et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] applied a susceptible-exposed-infectiousrecovered (SEIR) metapopulation model to simulate the epidemics of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak across all major cities in China on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China, and they estimated that 75 815 individuals (95% CI 37 304\u2013130 330)",
            "had been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. A recent study based on the Susceptible-InfectedRecovered-Dead (SIRD) model revealed that the cumulative number of infected cases will surpass 68,000 (as a lower bound) and could reach 140,000 (with an upper bound of 290,000) by",
            "February 29 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Notably, Huang and Qiao proposed a simple and data driven model based on the physics of natural growth algorithm and estimated the transmission rate of the SARSCoV-2 outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. The results of these modeling studies have provided important guidance for governments and health agencies to intensify preparedness and response efforts.",
            "Here we applied Boltzmann function to analyze the reported confirmed cases in mainland China, focusing Hubei Province and Wuhan City, the center of the outbreak, as well as those most affected provinces and economic centers. Strikingly, all data sets were well fitted to the",
            "Boltzmann function (Figs. 1, 2 and S1). More importantly, the data of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and worldwide were also well fitted to the function (Fig. 4). These results, in conjunction with that Boltzmann function can be inferred from a few assumptions (for detail, refer to the Methods section of the support information file), suggest that Boltzmann function is suitable for analyzing the epidemics of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. One advantage of this model is that parameter A2 directly gives an estimate of the potential total numbers of confirmed cases.",
            "In addition, unlike traditional epidemiological models that require much more detailed data for analysis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], Boltzmann function-based regression analysis only needs the cumulative number of confirmed cases, somehow as simple as the model proposed by Huang and Qiao [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>].",
            "Furthermore, the established Boltzmann functions allow us to forecast the future course of the epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 in different regions in the coming weeks. The potential total numbers of confirmed cases in mainland China, in Hubei Province, in Wuhan City (the center of the outbreak) and in other most affected provinces and top4 major cities, as summarized in Table 1, may provide valuable guidance for Chinese central and local governments to contain this outbreak at current critical stage. In particular, the numbers in mainland China and Hubei Province were estimated as 79589 (95% CI 71576, 93855) and 64817 (95% CI 58223, 77895), respectively, indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China might not be as bad as thought. Notably, our results also suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases will become minimal between",
            "Feb 28 and Mar 10 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) at 95% CI (Fig. 3A). This trend, if occur as predicted, may help citizens in China to release stress and anxiety, as there have been many provinces and/cities in China that have suspended public transportation systems and even implemented house quarantines for all urban households [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. In further support of these estimates by the Boltzmann function, the newly released cumulative number of confirmed cases in all the above geographic regions on Feb 15 and Feb 16 are very close to the predicted ones (refer to Table S2). Consistently, parameters of the established Boltzmann functions by regression analyses of the data from Jan 21 to Feb 16, 2020 (as presented in Fig. S4) are highly similar to those made by the data from Feb 21 to Feb 14, 2020."

            "Nevertheless, our estimates based on the established Boltzmann functions are not absolutely guaranteed, mainly because of the uncertainty of the reported data (Figs. 3, S2 and S3). We estimated the potential total numbers (refer to Table 1) under the assumption that the relative uncertainty of the reported data follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 10%, and this deviation may be underestimated. If the real uncertainty of released data by health commissions is larger than 10%, the potential total numbers of confirmed cases would accordingly increase, and the key dates will be postponed. Another limitation is that this estimate is based on the assumption that the overall conditions are not changing. This might not be true, given that in many regions the workers have started to return for work half a month post the Spring Festival holiday (schedulely ending on Feb 31), which may increase the SARSCoV-2 infection.
