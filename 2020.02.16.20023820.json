        "abstract": "We give an update to the original paper posted on 2/17/20 -- now (as of 3/1/20) the China deaths are rapidly decreasing, and we find an exponential decline to the power law similar to the that predicted by the network model of  \\citet{vazquez_polynomial_2006}.  At the same time, we see non-China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics.  Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate.\n    \n    (Original abstract) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease.  However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models.  Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic.  We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.",

We also report bootstrapped standard errors in brackets, which are more conservative in this small-sample context. See Efron and Tibshirani [1994] and<br/><br/>Horowitz [2001] for introductions to the bootstrap method.<br/><br/>In Fig. 6, the confidence intervals are calculated as follows. First, robust standard errors are calculated to account for heteroskedasticity. These standard errors are more conservative, which is advantageous considering our small sample size. Next, we calculate the critical value (the 95th quantile) from a t-distribution with n \u2212 2 degrees of freedom. The value n changes with each point along the x-axis. As fewer periods are considered, the critical value increases. The degrees of freedom is a function of this n, but subtracting two to account for the fact that two parameters are estimated (\u03b20 , \u03b21 ). The standard errors are quite small for these calculations. Considering periods 2-27 produces a bootstrapped standard error of 0.033, using 5,000 bootstrap replications."

In Fig. 3, we show a log-linear plot of the deaths for the past 6 days, along with the deaths in China shifted by 31 days, and one can see somewhat similar behavior but fortunately with a downturn recently.

The mortality rate seems to fall somewhere between the common flu (0.1%) and the SARs coronavirus (10%).",
            "In Figs. 4a and 4b, we plot the total number of confirmed cases and total number of reported deaths, as a function of the number of days beginning with January 21, 2020, when the WHO first started reporting on this pandemic in its Situation Reports [World Health Organization, 2020]. Both cases and deaths continue to grow at an alarming rate."

            "Note: Data from World Health Organization [2020].",
            "In standard epidemiological analysis, one assumes that the number of cases in diseases like this one grows exponentially, based upon the idea of a fixed reproduction rate. If each person infects n other people where n > 1 (the reproduction number), then the total number of cases should grow as nt/\u03c4 = eat , where \u03c4 is the incubation time, which depends on the characteristics of the particular disease. Several studies of COVID-19 have taken this approach to model the number of cases [e.g., Zhao et al, 2020]. This assumes there is no inhibition due to the interaction with already infected people, quarantine, or other prophylactic measures.",
            "While the data display large growth, they do not in fact follow exponential behavior. In the inset in",
            "Fig. 5 we show a log-normal plot of the mortality data, and the behavior is clearly not linear as it would be for exponential growth. In contrast, we find that the data are very well fit by assuming a power-law behavior with an exponent somewhat greater than two, as shown in the log-log plot in Fig. 5. The non-integer value of this power-law suggests a fractal type of behavior of the susceptibility mechanism, as we discuss below.",
            "First we notice that the total number of deaths in Fig. 4b appear to be growing in a roughly quadratic form (see Tab. 1 in Appendix A for the estimates of the quadratic fit), while the number of confirmed cases shown in Fig. 4a appears to follow similar behavior but is slowing down in the last few data points. There could be measurement error due to multiple factors.1 Starting on February 7, those individuals who test positive for COVID-19 but show no symptoms are no longer being reported as confirmed cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCohen_2020_a\" href=\"#rCohen_2020_a\">Cohen, 2020</a>]. We focus our analysis on deaths to circumvent some of the ambiguities of reporting confirmed cases, assuming that deaths are a more reliable indication of the extent of the disease. (However, there are reports that some deaths might be reported as due to other causes, such as severe pneumonia, and not attributed to this virus, so these numbers may also be inaccurate. Still, one set of data should give a good indication of the general trend of the pandemic.)",
            "Growing as t2 is what one would expect if a disease were growing in a population at the periphery of a compact region of infection. We believe that this is more likely than an exponential growth, because the number of susceptible individuals around an infected individual decays with time. Individuals already infected might face increased immunity and there are other individuals who might have had a mild infection that imparts immunity but without developing symptoms warranting testing. These various effects would inhibit the exponential growth of the virus.",
            "We find that a power-law provides a better fit to the data than a simple quadratic, as postulated by",
            "Brandenburg [2020]. In Fig. 5 we plot the number of total deaths vs. time on a log-log plot. As Fig. 6 shows, considering all of the time periods (excluding report #24) from January 21 to February 15 (1\u201327 on the horizontal axis), the estimated coefficient is statistically indistinguishable from 2. However, removing just the first period period (2\u201327 on the horizontal axis), the estimated coefficient is statistically larger than 2.",
            "As more periods are removed, the coefficient moves farther away from 2. Even at this preliminary stage with few data points, this illustration suggests that a power-law fit is more appropriate than a quadratic one.",
            "For illustration purposes, consider periods 8\u201327. The estimated coefficient is approximately 2.27 (the bootstrapped standard error with 5,000 replications is 0.014). This would imply that as the number of days of the pandemic increases by a factor of 21/2.27 = 1.357, the number of cases will double. Thus, starting from day 27 (Feb. 16) with 1,669 deaths, the number of deaths will double to approximately 3,340 on day",

The results imply that this network has an effective minimum path fractal dimension of 2.25. The implication is that the disease produces flares in which the growth is momentarily exponential, but then slows down until another flare-up. The averaged effect of this growth apparently yields a power-law.",
            "Wu et al [2020] suggest that if the pandemic spreads into new cities, exponential growth like what happened in Wuhan in the early stages would occur. Hopefully, if this were the case, it would be quickly stopped and slower behavior would ensue. But our prediction of approximately 13,350 deaths by March 27 relies on the assumption that a new major outbreak will not happen. Hermanowicz [2020] and Roosa et al.",
            "[2020] have recently modeled the disease using a logistical and other growth models. These models are able to predict the ultimate number of cases, and find results in the range of 20,000 to 60,000. We believe the numbers will be much greater, and expect a number of deaths in this range, if the fractal growth continues as it has for a few more months.",
            "We have followed our prediction for several days and have found no marked change in behavior, except for the data from WHO Situation Report #24, which gave an outsized jump of 254 cases to a total of 1,369 deaths. Reports stated that the data from China were incorrect that day because of double-counting of the results, but so far the WHO has not revised report #24. Looking at the large deviation from our prediction in fact led us to suspect that that data point was an outlier at the time.",
            "In recent days there has been a drop-off in the growth of new confirmed cases from China, suggesting an attenuation of the pandemic. We do not see that drop-off in the death rate. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy: (1) the number of confirmed cases may be showing the variability as it has in the past, and the current numbers are not capturing the actual situation, or (2) the pandemic is indeed slowing down but it will take a while (perhaps a week) for that to show up in the fatality data. Of course, we hope the latter is the case, but are not entirely confident considering the history of the reporting problems concerning this pandemic.",
            "Deviations above this power-law behavior might indicate that the pandemic is expanding from the current level of control, while deviations below might indicate that the disease is starting to fade. This analysis is early in the outbreak of COVID-19 and cannot predict the length of the outbreak nor the final fatality.",
            "However, it suggests that under current conditions, power-law growth better approximates the number of deaths than exponential growth, and may provide a tool to monitor whether a fundamental change is occurring. Hopefully, continued vigilance, timely testing, and careful care will end this scourge on humanity.",
