We use the observed data reported in CCDC's paper to estimate distribution of the generation interval of the infection and apply  the simulation results from the time delay dynamic system as well as released data from CCDC  to fit the growth rate. The conclusion is: Based our Fudan-CCDC model, the growth rate r of COVID-19 is almost in [0.30, 0.32] which is  larger than  the growth rate 0.1  estimated by CCDC {9},   and the  reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 is estimated by 3.25\u2264 R0 \u22643.4 if we simply use R=1+r*Tc with Tc=7.5, which is bigger than that of SARS. Some evolutions and predictions are listed.",

            "So we can obtain our first conclusion. Conjecture 2.1. The epidemic model for COVID-19 is SEIR if CCDC\u2019s data are correct.",
            "The above conclusion may be interpreted by that CCDC assumed that the epidemic model should be SEIR.",
            "Now we introduce how we can estimate the growth rate r."
        ],
        "3 Fudan-CCDC model": [
            "Our group has developed some models for the growth rate of COVID-19 (TDD-NCP models [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] and Fudan-CCDC models[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]) after Jin suggested to use the time delay model to fit the real data [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Because of the outstanding agreement with data from CCDC and the estimations on the growth rate are very stable, we decide to use the following Fudan-CCDC model. Other models also work very well to fit the CCDC data.",
            "Firstly, Let us introduce some variables: \u2022 I(t): (the distribution of) the cumulative number of cases in the infected stage at time t; \u2022 J(t): (the distribution of) the cumulative ones in hospitalization stage at time t; \u2022 G(t): (the distribution of) the number of infected and isolated but yet diagnosed cases at time t. They are infected in fact, but are not confirmed by the hospital, then not appeared in the infected list of CCDC; \u2022 I0(t): I0(t) = I(t) \u2212 J(t) \u2212 G(t). We further make some assumptions on the transition probability functions f2(t), f3(t) and f4(t): \u2022 f2(t): the transition probability from infection to illness onset; \u2022 f3(t): the transition probability from illness onset to hospitalization; \u2022 f4(t): the transition probability from infection to hospitalization, which can be calculated via the convolution of f2(t) and f3(t). We assume the log-normal distribution for f2(t) and the Weibull distrubution for f3(t)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], and the distribution parameters can be estimated from CCDC by fitting the figures in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. In particular, two important parameters are used: \u2022 \u03b2: denotes the growth rate, which is exactly the same as r: \u03b2 = r. \u2022 : denotes the quarantine strategy, for example, specially, we consider this parameter as the isolation rate. Large value of suggests that the government more likes to control the spreading of COVID-19.",
            "Now we introduce our Fudan-CCDC model: I(t), J(t) and G(t) can be approximated by the following (statistical) dynamical system: dI dt = rI0(t), dJ t",
            "f4(t \u2212 s)I0(s)ds.",
            "One can also use the discrete system with each step representing one day just as we have implemented in the code: I(t + 1) = I(t) + rI0(t), J(t + 1) = J(t) + r f4(t \u2212 s)I0(s), s\u2264t",
            "G(t + 1) = G(t) + (t) f2(t \u2212 s)I0(s) \u2212 (t) f4(t \u2212 s)I0(s).",
            "We will fit and estimate appropriate values of \u03b2(or r) and based on the cumulative diagnosed data from CCDC. Other versions of our Fudan-CCDC model are developing, specially, we are considering the stochastic version: that is to take random inputs into account, which is important to account for the influences from other regions. In math, we can easily generalize the model by random terms such as Brownian motion in the system, meanwhile the parameters have to be obtained from the real data. The another important version is to consider the interactions of two or more regions, Jin\u2019s group have developed some models based on TTD-NCP model[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. These models will also be developed in need of disease control and prevention.",
            "The simulation is implemented via Matlab with some additional constraints imposed. Here the results are summarized in Table 1 with the real data employed up to Feb 16, 2020.",
            "In the Table 1, we use two kind of quarantine strategies introduced below. We are surprised that our code can get uniform estimators on the growth rate r and the reproductive number R0.",
            "Two quarantine strategy: We can observe that is distinct for different time stages at the different regions. Now we assume two quarantine strategies, one uses the following assumption:",
            "which means that the quarantine strategy was observably changed at the day t . We report the results in Table 2.",
            "We also find that for the Diamond Princes Cruise Ship is \u03b2 = 0.3182, 1 = 0, 2 = 0.3239. Moreover, the results from the model imply the case in the Diamond Princes Cruise Ship may be very DANGEROUS, since is below one key THRESHOLD, where the number of the infected persons will growth quickly. We also very worry about the situations in Japan. We WARN here that every CDC in every country should track the number of the infected persons, and immediately increase to one suitable level.",
            "Starting date t0: Our model can also track the initial date of the event t0 if I(t0) is fixed. It is REALLY important to find the initial starting date statistically correct in different regions."
        ],
        "4 Evolutions and predictions": [
            "Now we present some figures of the evolutions and predictions of the event computed from the model, The data used in the simulation is ONLY number of the cumulative diagnosed people of different regions from CCDC until Feb. 16, everyone can download it from many websites or APP, we find the data from WIND(like Bloomberg). And the second quarantine strategy is imposed.",
            "Evolutions: Here is the evolution of the cumulative number of the infected cases, cumulative number of cases in hospitalization J(t), and the cumulative number of infected and isolated but yet diagnosed cases G(t). According to our model, total number of infected cases will be 48060(Wuhan), and 78480(China). Based on this data, it is easy to estimate various data, specially the fatality rate can be estimated directly. We would like to point out that the rate calculated here will be varying once the quarantine strategy is changed as the rate depend on .",
            "We also can obtain the cumulative incidence of diagnosed case and new cases that occurred in a given period which is displayed in Figure 2.",
            "Some figures and other results have been submitted to Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention(CCDC), Wuhan."
        ],
        "5 Conclusions on the reproductive number": [
            "Based our Fudan-CCDC model, the growth rate r of COVID-19 is almost in [0.30, 0.32] which is larger than the growth rate 0.1 estimated by CCDC [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], and the reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 is estimated by 3.25 \u2264 R0 \u2264 3.4 if we simply use R0 = 1 + r \u2217 Tc with Tc = 7.5.",
            "We have not compared the results with [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] and [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], since we are not very familiar with their methods.",
