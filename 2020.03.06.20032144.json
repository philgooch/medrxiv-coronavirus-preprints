        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning\nMETHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking\n\nRESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission.\nCONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date.  The RCOG and RCPCH have provided interim guidance to help maternity and neonatal services plan their response to COVID-19.",

There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported.

            "Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date. The RCOG and RCPCH have provided interim guidance to help maternity and neonatal services plan their response to COVID-19.",
            "There are limited data on the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak on women affected in pregnancy and their babies. Studies were all case-reports or series and of low quality. Outcomes reported varied, one series on COVID-19 did not report on maternal outcomes.<br/><br/>From the 10/19 women where maternal outcomes were reported, severe morbidity and mortality are not evident in mothers as they were for SARS and MERS.<br/><br/>From the data, an increase in risk of miscarriage cannot be ruled out at this stage given the SARS data. Data from early pregnancy units are needed on women affected by COVID-19 with matched controls."

Three human coronaviruses cause more severe, acute illnesses; MERS-CoV causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, SARS-CoV causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS and SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19.",

To guide treatment and prevention in women affected COVID-19 during pregnancy in the current outbreak we conducted a rapid review to guide management, of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy. Expert consensus will be required in areas where data is lacking at this early stage in the COVID-19 outbreak."

            "From the 10/19 women where maternal outcomes were reported, severe morbidity and mortality are not evident in mothers as they were for SARS and MERS.",
            "From the data, an increase in risk of miscarriage cannot be ruled out at this stage given the SARS data. Data from early pregnancy units are needed on women affected by COVID-19 with matched controls.",
            "In women affected by COVID-19 with ongoing pregnancy, for surveillance for fetal growth restriction would be reasonable, given the acute and chronic placental changes observed and 2/3 ongoing pregnancies being affected by fetal growth restriction after SARS and an abruption noted after MERS.",
            "The need for provision for fetal monitoring including serial ultrasound for women with COVID-19 will be challenging for maternity services. Women will need to be cared for in units with appropriate neonatal intensive care facilities as COVID-19 is associated with pre-term delivery in 50% of reported cases.",
            "In SARS and MERS-affected cases, delivery was most often indicated by maternal hypoxaemia. In COVID-19, if maternal illness is not as severe, the considerations will be based more on obstetric indications for delivery.",
            "Information on vertical transmission for COVID-19 is limited, although testing of 15 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 has all been negative. Guidance on mode of delivery requires expert consensus until further information emerges.",
            "There is evidence for vertical transmission of HCoV 229E, seroconversion was not investigated however and all infants remained well, but there is no evidence for vertical transmission for any other coronavirus.",
            "Consensus guidance from China advises \u201cdelayed cord clamping is not recommended\u201d in order to reduce the risk of vertical transmission and that infants should be separated from mothers affected by COVID 19[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Infants may acquire COVID-19 from their mothers after delivery via normal routes of transmission.",
            "Guidance from China is that \u201cInfants should not be fed with the breast milk from mothers with confirmed or suspected of 2019-nCoV.\u201d Guidance from the CDC is less clear but is still precautionary [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>].",
            "Expert consensus is needed for breastfeeding and the use of expressed breastmilk for infant feeding for mothers affected by COVID-19 until more informative data emerges and for deciding whether women with COVID-19 who are symptomatic, suggesting high viral load, should breastfeed babies with unknown status.",

In previous coronavirus epidemics there has anecdotally been a tendency towards admitting any symptomatic, pregnant woman with proven infection.",
            "A surge in workload will likely be seen in the NHS and across the world at a time when staffing is well below optimal levels. Pragmatic choices will need to be made about achievable and acceptable levels of care with national guidance and local adaptation. It will need to be emphasised that chest imaging should be undertaken as clinically indicated in pregnant women.",
            "Therapeutics announced as being under consideration and trial in the outbreak include Kaletra (Lopinavir and Ritonavir), Remdesivir and Chloroquine. Kaletra [24] is used in the UK during pregnancy for treatment of HIV where the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks of toxicity seen in animal studies. The use of Chloroquine outweighs the risks in the prevention and treatment of malaria during pregnancy [25]. Remdesivir has been used for the treatment of Ebola in pregnant women[26], however it should be acknowledged that Ebola is a condition with a CFR of 50% for which there would be higher tolerance for adverse effects of a potentially beneficial treatment than would be the case for COVID-19 where the CFR is around 1%. It would seem reasonable not to exclude seriously ill pregnant women from trials of these therapies for COVID-19.",
